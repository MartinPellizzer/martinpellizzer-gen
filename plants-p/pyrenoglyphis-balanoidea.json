    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis balanoidea, commonly known as the sea hare or a type of nudibranch, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Anaspidae. It is characterized by its soft, elongated body and the presence of a distinctive, often colorful mantle that can be used for camouflage or warning signals. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other plant matter. Its reproductive system is unique, with both males and females possessing external genitalia for direct sperm transfer. The plant-like appearance of some species in this genus has led to confusion with certain algae, but it is clearly a member of the mollusk class."
