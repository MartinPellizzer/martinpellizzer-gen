It features aromatic, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong, licorice-like scent, which comes from compounds in its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
