    "intro": "Paspalum setaceum var. supinum, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate flooding, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
