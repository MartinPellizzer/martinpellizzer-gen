    "intro": "Prunus virginiana var. demissa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching branches and small, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red, edible berries. Its compact form and ornamental value make it suitable for hedgerows and gardens. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
