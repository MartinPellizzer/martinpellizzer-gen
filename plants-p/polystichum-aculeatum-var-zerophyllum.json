    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. zerophyllum, commonly known as the spiny wood fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial fern native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges and spiny protrusions along the leaflets. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
