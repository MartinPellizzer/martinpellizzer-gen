    "intro": "Phylacanthus, commonly known as the horned bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its fruits, which are often used for seed dispersal. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Phylacanthus species have palmate leaves and produce showy, yellow or white flowers. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
