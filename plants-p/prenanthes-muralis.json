    "intro": "Prenanthes muralis, commonly known as the wall lettuce, is a small flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shady areas such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer. Prenanthes muralis is often found growing on rocky or disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
