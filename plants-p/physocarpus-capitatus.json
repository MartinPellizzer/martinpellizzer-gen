It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in the summer. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically red or black, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture.
