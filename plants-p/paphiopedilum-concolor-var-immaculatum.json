    "intro": "Paphiopedilum concolor var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white-stemmed slipper orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped lip that is typically white or pale pink, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
