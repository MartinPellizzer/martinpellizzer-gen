    "intro": "Pitcairnia roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
