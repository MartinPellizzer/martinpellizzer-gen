It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental and low-maintenance gardens."
