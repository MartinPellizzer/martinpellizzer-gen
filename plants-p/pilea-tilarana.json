    "intro": "Pilea tilarana, commonly known as the Tilarana begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea tilarana is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
