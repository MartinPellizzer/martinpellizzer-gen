    "intro": "Piptatherum songaricum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
