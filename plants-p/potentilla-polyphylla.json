    "intro": "Potentilla polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets, giving it its common name, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these harsh habitats. Potentilla polyphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
