    "intro": "Polypogon divulsus, commonly known as the cutgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 2\u20138 inches long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, ditches, and roadside areas. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems."
