    "intro": "Petrogeton alpinum, commonly known as the alpine petrogeton, is a low-growing plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Petrogeton alpinum is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in cold, nutrient-poor environments."
