It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, including birds and insects. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
