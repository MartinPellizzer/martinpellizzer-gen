    "intro": "Pterocephalus, commonly known as the \"goat's beard,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble the beard of a goat, hence their common name. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Pterocephalus species are perennial herbs that produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine due to their potential pharmacological properties."
