    "intro": "Perymenium asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved perymenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Perymenium asperifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland understories."
