It is characterized by its unique floral structure that closely resembles a wasp, aiding in pollination by attracting insect pollinators. The plant produces a single, greenish-yellow flower with a narrow, elongated labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and forest floors. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms."
