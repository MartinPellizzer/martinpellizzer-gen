    "intro": "Poterium dictyocarpum var. virescens, commonly known as the green-fruited fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern species. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases that are green to brown in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The varietal name 'virescens' refers to its tendency to develop a greenish hue as it matures."
