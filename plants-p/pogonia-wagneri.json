    "intro": "Pogonia wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's pink twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in many areas."
