    "intro": "Pseudolycopodiella caroliniana var. mesetarum, commonly known as the eastern clubmoss, is a variant of a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the base of its leafy shoots. Its leaves are linear and arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
