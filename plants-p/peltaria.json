    "intro": "Peltaria, commonly known as the common pellitory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, including Peltaria hirsuta and Peltaria myrtifolia, which are native to Europe and parts of Asia. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in umbels. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Peltaria species are also valued for their historical use in traditional medicine."
