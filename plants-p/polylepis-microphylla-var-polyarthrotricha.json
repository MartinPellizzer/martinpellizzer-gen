    "intro": "Polylepis microphylla var. polyarthrotricha, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a small evergreen tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and dark, fissured bark. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, humid climates at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
