    "intro": "Plottzia paronychia, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas subject to salt spray. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Plottzia paronychia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
