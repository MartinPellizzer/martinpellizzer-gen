    "intro": "Plantago macrostachys var. subandina, commonly known as the Andean plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments it inhabits. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. The species is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
