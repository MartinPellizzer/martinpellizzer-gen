    "intro": "Potentilla aurea f. trifolioata, commonly known as the three-leaved gold cinquefoil, is a botanical variant of the common gold cinquefoil. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this form. Its flowers are usually bright yellow, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
