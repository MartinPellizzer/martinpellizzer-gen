    "intro": "Polypodium percivalii, commonly known as the Percival\u2019s huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
