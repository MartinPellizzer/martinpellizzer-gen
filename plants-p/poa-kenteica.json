It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Poa kenteica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and supporting local biodiversity."
