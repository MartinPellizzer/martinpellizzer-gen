    "intro": "Pelargonium sphondyliifolium, commonly known as the rose geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its fragrant, rose-scented flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub with upright stems and produces small, showy blooms in shades of pink, red, and white. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a potted plant. The leaves are thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions."
