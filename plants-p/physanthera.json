    "intro": "Physanthera, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are herbaceous perennials with erect stems and clusters of small, greenish or white flowers. Their leaves are typically basal, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive, sometimes waxy texture. Physanthera species are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
