    "intro": "Peyritschia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf peyritschia, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
