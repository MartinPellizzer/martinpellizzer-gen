It is a member of the Araceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is known for its unique growth habit, where flowers and leaves emerge from the base of the stem rather than the top. Its foliage is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as houseplants. While it does produce small, inconspicuous flowers, the plant is primarily valued for its colorful leaves."
