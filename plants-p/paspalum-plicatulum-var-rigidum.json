    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
