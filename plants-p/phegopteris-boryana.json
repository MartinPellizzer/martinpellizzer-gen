    "intro": "Phegopteris boryana, commonly known as the Bory's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in the understory. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable species for studying the evolution and ecology of ferns in temperate regions."
