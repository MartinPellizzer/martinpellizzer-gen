    "intro": "Pterostylis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect flower that is usually greenish-yellow in color. Its morphology is characteristic of the orchid family, with a specialized structure for pollination by insects. The species is relatively small, with a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it a delicate and often overlooked member of the flora."
