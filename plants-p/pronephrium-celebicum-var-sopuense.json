    "intro": "Pronephrium celebicum var. sopuense, commonly known as the Celebes pronephrium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, which are followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood."
