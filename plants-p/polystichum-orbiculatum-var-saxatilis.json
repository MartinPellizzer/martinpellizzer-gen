    "intro": "Polystichum orbiculatum var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile wood fern, is a variant of the orbiculate wood fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features dense, evergreen fronds that are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive orbicular shape. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, helping it to anchor in harsh, well-drained environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
