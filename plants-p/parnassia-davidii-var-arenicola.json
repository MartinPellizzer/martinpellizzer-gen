    "intro": "Parnassia davidii var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
