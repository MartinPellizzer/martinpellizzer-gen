    "intro": "Panicum procumbens, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has spreading rhizomes and forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
