    "intro": "Pollinia cumingii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered Cuming's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, featuring showy, often fragrant blossoms. The plant produces pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate its unique pollination mechanism. Its flowers typically bloom during the wet season, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
