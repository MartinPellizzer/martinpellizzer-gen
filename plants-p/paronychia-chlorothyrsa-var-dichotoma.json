    "intro": "Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance."
