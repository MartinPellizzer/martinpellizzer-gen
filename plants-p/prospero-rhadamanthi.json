    "intro": "Prospero rhadamanthi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Prospero rhadamanthi is listed as critically endangered in its native range."
