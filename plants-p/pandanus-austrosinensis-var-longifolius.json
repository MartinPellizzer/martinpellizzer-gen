It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it resilient to high humidity and salt spray."
