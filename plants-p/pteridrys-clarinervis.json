    "intro": "Pteridrys clarinervis, commonly known as the clear-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It features prominently veined leaves that are often light green, with a distinct, clear vascular pattern. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteridrys clarinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
