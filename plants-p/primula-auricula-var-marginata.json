    "intro": "Primula auricula var. marginata, commonly known as the margined primrose, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The varietal form 'marginata' is notable for its white-edged petals, which set it apart from the typical primrose. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its early spring bloom, often appearing before many other flowering plants."
