    "intro": "Phegopteris moussetii, commonly known as the Mousset's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Phegopteris moussetii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
