    "intro": "Picea crassifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are thick and wax-coated. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and poor soil conditions. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
