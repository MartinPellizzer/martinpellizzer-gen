    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. ellipsoides, commonly known as the elliptical blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its elliptical-shaped fruits. This plant is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its leaves are oval and serrated, while its flowers are small and white, appearing in early spring. The fruits, which are small, dark berries, ripen in late summer and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedging."
