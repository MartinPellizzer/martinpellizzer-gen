    "intro": "Polypodium austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian polypody, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette pattern. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium austriacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
