    "intro": "Pycreus pumilus var. substerilis, commonly known as the dwarf pycreus, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited seed production, propagation is often done through vegetative cuttings."
