    "intro": "Portulacaria armiana, commonly known as the elephant bush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Portulacaria armiana is popular as a houseplant and in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
