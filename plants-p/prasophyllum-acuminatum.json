    "intro": "Prasophyllum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved greenhood, is an orchid species native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown floral pouch and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted to its scent and structure. Prasophyllum acuminatum is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers during the spring and early summer."
