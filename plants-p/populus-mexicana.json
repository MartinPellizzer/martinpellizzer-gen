    "intro": "Populus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Populus mexicana is often found in riparian zones, thriving along rivers and streams due to its preference for moist soils. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
