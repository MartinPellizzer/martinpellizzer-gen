    "intro": "Petrocosmea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy petrocosmea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea pubescens is considered a conservation concern."
