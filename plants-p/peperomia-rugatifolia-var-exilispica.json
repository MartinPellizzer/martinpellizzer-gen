    "intro": "Peperomia rugatifolia var. exilispica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a textured, slightly wrinkled surface, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are typically borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
