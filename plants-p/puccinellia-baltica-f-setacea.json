    "intro": "Puccinellia baltica f. setacea, commonly known as the tufted saltmeadow grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other wetlands with high salinity. It has small, spikelet-based inflorescences and produces wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation in temperate regions."
