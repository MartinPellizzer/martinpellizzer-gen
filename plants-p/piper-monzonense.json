    "intro": "Piper monzonense, commonly known as the Monzon mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some local cuisines. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
