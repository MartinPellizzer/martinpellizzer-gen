    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. armena, commonly known as the Armenian Scots pine, is a subspecies native to the Caucasus region and parts of Turkey. It is a tall evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this subspecies are usually smaller and more slender compared to those of the typical Scots pine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The tree is valued for its timber and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native range."
