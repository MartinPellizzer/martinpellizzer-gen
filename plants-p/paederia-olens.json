It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible but have a peppery taste. Paederia olens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and unique flavor make it a notable plant in horticulture and traditional cuisine."
