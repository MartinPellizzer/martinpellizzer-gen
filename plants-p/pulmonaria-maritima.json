    "intro": "Pulmonaria maritima, commonly known as sea lungwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Pulmonaria maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
