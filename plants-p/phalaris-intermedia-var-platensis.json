It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are narrow, flat, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This plant is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to moist, sandy soils."
