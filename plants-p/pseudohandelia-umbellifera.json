    "intro": "Pseudohandelia umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically spineless, making it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance houseplant."
