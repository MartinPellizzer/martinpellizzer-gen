    "intro": "Pyrrocoma lanulosa, commonly known as the woolly pyrrocoma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Pyrrocoma lanulosa is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation."
