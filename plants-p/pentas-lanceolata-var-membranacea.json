It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
