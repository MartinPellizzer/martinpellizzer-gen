    "intro": "Pilea psilogyne, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its round, shield-shaped leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea psilogyne is a compact, evergreen perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and indirect light. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
