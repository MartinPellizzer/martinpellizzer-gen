    "intro": "Populus wolfiana, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its wide distribution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus wolfiana is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
