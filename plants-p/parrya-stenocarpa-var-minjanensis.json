    "intro": "Parrya stenocarpa var. minjanensis, commonly known as the Minjanean parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
