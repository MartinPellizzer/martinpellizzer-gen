    "intro": "Panicum kahiliense, commonly known as the Hawaiian grass or kahili grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces fluffy, pale green or silver-tan inflorescences that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects in tropical and subtropical regions."
