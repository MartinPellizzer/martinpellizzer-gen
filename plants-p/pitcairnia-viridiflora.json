    "intro": "Pitcairnia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces striking greenish-white flowers that bloom in a compact inflorescence, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Pitcairnia viridiflora is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
