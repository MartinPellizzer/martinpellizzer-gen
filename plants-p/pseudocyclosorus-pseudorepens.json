    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping pseudocyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, slender fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
