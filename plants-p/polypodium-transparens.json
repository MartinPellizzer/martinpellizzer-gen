    "intro": "Polypodium transparens, commonly known as the transparent huperzia, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium transparens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
