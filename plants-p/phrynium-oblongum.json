It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental in tropical gardens. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
