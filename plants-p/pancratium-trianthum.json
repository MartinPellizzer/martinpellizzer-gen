    "intro": "Pancratium trianthum, commonly known as the yellow bulbous lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often with a red or orange throat. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are long and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have faded. Pancratium trianthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
