It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
