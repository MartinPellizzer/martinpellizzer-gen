    "intro": "Plectaneia elastica var. insularis, commonly known as the island rubber vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to certain Pacific islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, elongated leaves and the ability to produce a milky latex when damaged. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments. Its stems are flexible and can elongate significantly, allowing it to climb and entangle other vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
