    "intro": "Phegopteris barberi, commonly known as the Sierra fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, deciduous fern with fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a distinctive, finely divided foliage that forms a dense, low-growing carpet on rocky slopes and stream banks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phegopteris barberi is considered a vulnerable species."
