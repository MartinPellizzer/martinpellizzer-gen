    "intro": "Pronephrium nudatum, commonly known as the naked kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance. Pronephrium nudatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
