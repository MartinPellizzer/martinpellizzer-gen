    "intro": "Pyrus arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous racemes, followed by small, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. Pyrus arbuscula is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
