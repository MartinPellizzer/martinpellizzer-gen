    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria cognata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Pseudoroegneria cognata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
