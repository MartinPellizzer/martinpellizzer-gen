    "intro": "Pulassarium oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-shaped pulassarium, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, oval-shaped leaves that resemble small olives, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming umbels that add to its ornamental appeal. Despite its visual interest, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific growing requirements."
