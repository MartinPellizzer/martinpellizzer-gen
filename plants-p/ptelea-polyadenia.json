    "intro": "Ptelea polyadenia, commonly known as the redstem dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, red-tinged stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin. Ptelea polyadenia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
