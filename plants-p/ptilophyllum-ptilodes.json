    "intro": "Ptilophyllum ptilodes, commonly known as the silky feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
