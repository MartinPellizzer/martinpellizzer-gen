    "intro": "Pteris seticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arched or sickle-shaped. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris seticaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
