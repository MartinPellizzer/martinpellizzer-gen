    "intro": "Populus occidentalis, commonly known as the western poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones along rivers and streams. The wood of Populus occidentalis is lightweight and soft, making it suitable for paper production and other industrial uses."
