    "intro": "Pinus wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a small evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cones that are often clustered in groups of three, a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
