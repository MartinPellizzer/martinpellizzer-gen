    "intro": "Poecilopteris polyphylla, commonly known as the multileaved cliff fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the genus Poecilopteris, which is part of the order Marattiopsidales. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds with multiple leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. This fern thrived during the Late Cretaceous period and is often found in fossilized form in sedimentary rock layers. Its structure suggests it was a robust, shade-tolerant plant that likely grew in moist, tropical environments. The plant's complex morphology provides valuable insights into the evolution of ferns and early angiosperms."
