It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like blades with a rigid, upright growth habit, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, feathery bracts. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its distinctive appearance making it a popular choice in wetland gardens."
