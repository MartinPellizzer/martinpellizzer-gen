    "intro": "Poa remota var. contracta, commonly known as the compact bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged on slender stalks, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
