    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
