    "intro": "Prunus padus var. brachytricha, commonly known as the dwarf blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a high acidity and are often used in jams and wines. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
