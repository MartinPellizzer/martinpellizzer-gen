    "intro": "Pontederia aquatica, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, depending on water levels. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Pickerelweed is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for wildlife."
