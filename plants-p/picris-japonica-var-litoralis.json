    "intro": "Picris japonica var. litoralis, commonly known as sea dandelion, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Japan and other parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is often found in shallow tidal zones and is an important part of the coastal flora."
