    "intro": "Paspalum obscurum, commonly known as black paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and can thrive in both temperate and subtropical regions. Paspalum obscurum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
