    "intro": "Pholidota pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pholidota, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick, leathery bark that provides protection against environmental stress. Pholidota pusilla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
