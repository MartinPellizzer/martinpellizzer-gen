    "intro": "Pyrola pumila, commonly known as the mossy cowwheat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense mat of moss-like foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as boreal forests and mountainous regions. Pyrola pumila is adapted to cold climates and is often found in nutrient-poor soils."
