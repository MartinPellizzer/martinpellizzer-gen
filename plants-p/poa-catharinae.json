    "intro": "Poa catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, with elongated, awned lemmas. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
