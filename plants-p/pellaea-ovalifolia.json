    "intro": "Pellaea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pellaea ovalifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates."
