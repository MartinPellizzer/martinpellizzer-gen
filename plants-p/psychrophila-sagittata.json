    "intro": "Psychrophila sagittata, commonly known as the cold-loving arrowleaf, is a unique plant adapted to thrive in extremely cold environments. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that help reduce surface area and minimize heat loss. The plant typically grows in alpine or arctic regions where temperatures remain consistently low. Its flowering period occurs during the brief summer months when temperatures rise slightly. Psychrophila sagittata plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food and habitat for specialized cold-adapted organisms."
