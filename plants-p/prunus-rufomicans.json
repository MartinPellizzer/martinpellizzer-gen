    "intro": "Prunus rufomicans, commonly known as the red-leaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged leaves, which turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are popular among birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Prunus rufomicans is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and ecological benefits."
