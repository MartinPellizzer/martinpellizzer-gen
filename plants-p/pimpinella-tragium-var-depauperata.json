    "intro": "Pimpinella tragium var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and narrow, pinnately divided leaves. This variety is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has a slender stem and produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures."
