    "intro": "Pandanus ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into edible fruits known as \"breadfruit.\" Its leaves are often used in traditional thatching and weaving practices. Pandanus ponapensis plays an important ecological and cultural role in its native regions."
