    "intro": "Poa ketoiensis, commonly known as the Koto grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Poa ketoiensis is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of native New Zealand vegetation and its potential use in restoration projects."
