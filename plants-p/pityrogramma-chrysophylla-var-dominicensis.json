    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. dominicensis, commonly known as the Dominican spleenwort, is a fern species native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive golden hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
