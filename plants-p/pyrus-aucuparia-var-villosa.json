    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and central Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish-brown stems and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are typically small and yellow or red in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and wildlife in gardens and natural habitats."
