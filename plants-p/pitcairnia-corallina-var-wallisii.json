It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
