    "intro": "Pouteria psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred mushroom tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into large, round fruits resembling mushrooms, which give it its common name. The fruit's spores are dispersed by wind and animals, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest. Botanically, it is notable for its unique fruit morphology and its association with hallucinogenic spores used in traditional rituals."
