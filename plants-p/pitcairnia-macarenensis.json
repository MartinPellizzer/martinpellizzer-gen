    "intro": "Pitcairnia macarenensis, commonly known as the Macarena pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
