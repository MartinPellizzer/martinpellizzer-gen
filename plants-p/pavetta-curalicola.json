    "intro": "Pavetta curalicola, commonly known as the coastal pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, often on sand dunes or rocky shores, where it tolerates salty air and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Pavetta curalicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various small insects and birds."
