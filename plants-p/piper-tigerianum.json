    "intro": "Piper tigerianum, commonly known as the tiger vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or as a ground cover in humid climates. However, it can be invasive if not managed properly."
