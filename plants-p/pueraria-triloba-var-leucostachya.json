    "intro": "Pueraria triloba var. leucostachya, commonly known as the white-stemmed cowpea, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets and its distinctive white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
