It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and flat, grass-like leaves. This plant is highly adaptable and can grow in a variety of waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes, riverbanks, and coastal areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its extensive rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands."
