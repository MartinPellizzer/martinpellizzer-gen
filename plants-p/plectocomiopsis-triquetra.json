    "intro": "Plectocomiopsis triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its unique triquetrous (three-angled) seed pods. The plant produces striking white to pale blue flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps, while its stems are erect and slender. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plectocomiopsis triquetra is considered a species of conservation concern."
