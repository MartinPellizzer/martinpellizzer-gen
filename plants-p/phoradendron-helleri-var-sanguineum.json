    "intro": "Phoradendron helleri var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak and other hardwood trees. It has small, elliptical leaves that are typically green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients and water from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
