    "intro": "Peperomia tenella var. epiphytica, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are often marked with red or purple veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is dense and compact, making it ideal for container gardening or as part of a terrarium setup. It prefers indirect light, moderate humidity, and well-draining soil to thrive."
