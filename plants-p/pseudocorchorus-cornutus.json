    "intro": "Pseudocorchorus cornutus, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Pseudocorchorus cornutus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
