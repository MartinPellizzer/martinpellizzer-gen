    "intro": "Pneumatopteris michaelis, commonly known as the Michael's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually divided into small, linear segments, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
