    "intro": "Pleurothallis ochracea, commonly known as the yellow pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This terrestrial orchid typically grows as a small, epiphytic plant with slender pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a yellowish to orange hue, and they often have a subtle fragrance. The plant prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its delicate appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
