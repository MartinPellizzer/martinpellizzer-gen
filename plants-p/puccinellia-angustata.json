    "intro": "Puccinellia angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments."
