    "intro": "Puelia guluensis, commonly known as the Gulu puelia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its range."
