    "intro": "Portulaca legrandii, commonly known as the Mexican sun rose, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in hot, arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Portulaca legrandii is often used in rock gardens and as a bedding plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
