    "intro": "Pleurothallis nemorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom on slender, hairy stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on air, rain, and decaying matter for nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
