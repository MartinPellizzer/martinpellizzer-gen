    "intro": "Purpusia arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert scrub and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Purpusia arizonica plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
