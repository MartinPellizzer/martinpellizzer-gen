    "intro": "Populus, commonly known as aspen, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the family Salicaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite leaf arrangement, smooth bark, and often heart-shaped leaves. Populus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are known for their rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas. They produce small, catkin-like flowers and are often found in moist, well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, such as Populus tremula (European aspen) and Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen)."
