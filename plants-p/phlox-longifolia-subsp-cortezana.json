It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-like fruits after flowering. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to drought conditions."
