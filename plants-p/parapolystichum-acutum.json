    "intro": "Parapolystichum acutum, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, clustered sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their foliage year-round, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
