    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius f. novohibernicus, commonly known as the New Ireland pandanus, is a variant of the screw pine characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves. This plant is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Solomon Islands and New Ireland, and thrives in tropical coastal environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional thatching and basket weaving due to their fibrous texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems."
