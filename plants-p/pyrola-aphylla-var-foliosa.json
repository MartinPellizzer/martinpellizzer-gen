    "intro": "Pyrola aphylla var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features clustered, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often retaining their color through the winter, which contributes to its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
