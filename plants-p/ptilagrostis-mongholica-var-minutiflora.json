    "intro": "Ptilagrostis mongholica var. minutiflora, commonly known as the Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy or rocky substrates. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
