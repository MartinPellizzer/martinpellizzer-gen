    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate coastal conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
