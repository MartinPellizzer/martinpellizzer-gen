    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis var. rebunensis, commonly known as the Rebun lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink and purple, often with a distinctive hooded shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
