    "intro": "Puya volcanensis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom only once in its lifetime, typically during the dry season. Its rosette of sword-shaped leaves is adapted to collect and store water in the arid environment. Puya volcanensis is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over a century."
