    "intro": "Pityrogramma galapagoensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos water clover, is a fern species endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
