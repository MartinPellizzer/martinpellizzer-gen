    "intro": "Polypodium subauriculatum var. serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaflets that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
