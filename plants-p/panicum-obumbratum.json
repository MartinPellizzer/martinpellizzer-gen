    "intro": "Panicum obumbratum, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
