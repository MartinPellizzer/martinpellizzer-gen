    "intro": "Primula farinosa f. exscapa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette of hairy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens with cool, moist conditions."
