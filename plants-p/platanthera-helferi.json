    "intro": "Platanthera helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
