    "intro": "Pityrogramma elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize wetlands and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a lanceolate shape, with a smooth, waxy surface. Pityrogramma elongata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
