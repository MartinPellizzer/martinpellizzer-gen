It features dense, dark green foliage with a conical shape, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, exhibiting moderate drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for bonsai and garden decoration."
