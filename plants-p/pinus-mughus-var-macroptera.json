    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. macroptera, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a variant of the Himalayan blue pine. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical species. The cones of this variety are notably larger and more elongated, often reaching lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cold climates, typically found in the mountainous areas of the Indian subcontinent. This plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
