    "intro": "Paeonia officinalis var. peregrina, commonly known as the Persian peony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features showy, double blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, typically appearing in late spring. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh conditions. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
