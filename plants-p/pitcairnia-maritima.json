    "intro": "Pitcairnia maritima, commonly known as the sea pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its adaptability to coastal conditions, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
