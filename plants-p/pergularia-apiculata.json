    "intro": "Pergularia apiculata, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Pergularia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
