It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to dense hair coverage. Puccinellia interior plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
