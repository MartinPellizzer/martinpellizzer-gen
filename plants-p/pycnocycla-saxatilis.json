    "intro": "Pycnocycla saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
