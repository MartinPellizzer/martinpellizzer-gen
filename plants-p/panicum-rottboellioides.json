    "intro": "Panicum rottboellioides, commonly known as Rottboell's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, grayish-brown seed heads that are distinctive and attractive. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
