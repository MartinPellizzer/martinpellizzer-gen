    "intro": "Poikilacanthus phyllocalyx, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking contrast between the upper and lower surfaces. The plant's fronds are dimorphic, with the upper surface being dark green and the lower surface pale or white, giving it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes in gardens and greenhouses."
