    "intro": "Pabstiella curti-bradei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. Its unique appearance and habitat requirements make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Pabstiella curti-bradei is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
