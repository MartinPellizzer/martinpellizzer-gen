    "intro": "Pseudomelissitus, commonly known as the honeybee plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants typically have opposite or whorled leaf arrangements and produce small, berry-like fruits. Pseudomelissitus species are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, where they thrive in a variety of habitats. Their botanical features make them valuable in both horticulture and ecological studies."
