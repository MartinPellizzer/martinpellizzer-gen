It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly found on the islands of Palau. This plant is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Pandanus paloensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various local fauna."
