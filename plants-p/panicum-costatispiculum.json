    "intro": "Panicum costatispiculum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Panicum costatispiculum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
