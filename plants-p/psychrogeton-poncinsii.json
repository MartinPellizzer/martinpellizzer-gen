    "intro": "Psychrogeton poncinsii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves, which help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar morphological features. Psychrogeton poncinsii plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
