It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to the vegetation cover. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
