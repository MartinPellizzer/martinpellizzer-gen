    "intro": "Polygala triphylla var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glaucous, bluish-green stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
