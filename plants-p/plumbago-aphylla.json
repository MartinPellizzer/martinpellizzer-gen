    "intro": "Plumbago aphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf plumbago, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features slender, woody stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silver-white underside. Plumbago aphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
