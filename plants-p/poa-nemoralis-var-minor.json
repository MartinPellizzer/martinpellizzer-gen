    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. This variety is often found in association with other woodland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
