    "intro": "Polypodium album, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
