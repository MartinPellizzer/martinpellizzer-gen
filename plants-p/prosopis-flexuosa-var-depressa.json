    "intro": "Prosopis flexuosa var. depressa, commonly known as the low catclaw acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
