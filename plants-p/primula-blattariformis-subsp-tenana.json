    "intro": "Primula blattariformis subsp. tenana, commonly known as the Tenana primrose, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
