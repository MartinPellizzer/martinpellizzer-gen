    "intro": "Paracelsea fruticosa, commonly known as the purpleleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pale green, bead-like fruits. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Paracelsea fruticosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
