    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 smithii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera filiformis, characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
