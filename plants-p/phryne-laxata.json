    "intro": "Phryne laxata, commonly known as the slender rock-fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short pedicels. These flowers are followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible and attract various bird species. Phryne laxata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in rocky or coastal habitats."
