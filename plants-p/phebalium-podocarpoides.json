    "intro": "Phebalium podocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, cylindrical seed pods. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and coastal areas. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, pod-like structures that remain on the plant for years. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
