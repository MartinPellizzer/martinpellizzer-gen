    "intro": "Phaseolus chiapasanus, commonly known as the Chiapas bean, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, typical of many Phaseolus species, and the plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the genus."
