    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. badensis, commonly known as the Baden grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe, particularly found in the Alps and surrounding regions. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
