    "intro": "Panicum nilagiricum, commonly known as Nilagiri panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Nilgiri Mountains in South India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Panicum nilagiricum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
