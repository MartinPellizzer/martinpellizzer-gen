It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with broad, prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
