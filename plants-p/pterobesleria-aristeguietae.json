    "intro": "Pterobesleria aristeguietae, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique ecological role supports biodiversity in its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
