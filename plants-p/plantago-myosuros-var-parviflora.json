    "intro": "Plantago myosuros var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and in wetlands. The plant features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. Its seeds are encased in a sticky, fleshy capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
