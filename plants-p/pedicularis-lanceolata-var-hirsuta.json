    "intro": "Pedicularis lanceolata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spurred orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
