    "intro": "Paspalum poeppigianum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments. Paspalum poeppigianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
