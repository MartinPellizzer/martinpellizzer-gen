    "intro": "Papillaria palustris, commonly known as the marsh papillaria, is a small flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often sprawl along the ground. Papillaria palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
