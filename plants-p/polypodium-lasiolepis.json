    "intro": "Polypodium lasiolepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Polypodium lasiolepis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
