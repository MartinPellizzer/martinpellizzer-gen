    "intro": "Pyrus betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf pear, is a species of pear native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a rounded crown. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a distinctive whitish underside, resembling the leaves of birch trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
