It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its unique, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
