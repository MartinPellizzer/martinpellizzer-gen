    "intro": "Pelatantheria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on trees without soil. The plant has no true roots and relies on its leaves for nutrient absorption, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Pelatantheria thrives in shaded, humid environments with high air moisture, often found in the canopy of pine forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
