It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. Psychotria anisocephala is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
