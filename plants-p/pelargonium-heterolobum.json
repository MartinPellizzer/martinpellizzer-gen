    "intro": "Pelargonium heterolobum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
