    "intro": "Pavonia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle pavonia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact, similar to stinging nettle. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Pavonia urticifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
