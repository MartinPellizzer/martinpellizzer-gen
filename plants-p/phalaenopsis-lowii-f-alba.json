It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions like Thailand and Malaysia.

Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are long-lasting, often blooming multiple times a year, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
