    "intro": "Parnassia palustris var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender white crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive blue-green color, while the stems are slender and often hairy. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and smaller flowers."
