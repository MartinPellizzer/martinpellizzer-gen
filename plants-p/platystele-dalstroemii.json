    "intro": "Platystele dalstroemii, commonly known as the giant ghost plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its epiphytic or terrestrial growth habits. Its flowers, which are small and often pale in color, are borne on a spike and are pollinated by insects. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
