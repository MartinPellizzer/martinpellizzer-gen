    "intro": "Pinus cembra var. flexilis, commonly known as the flexible Swiss stone pine, is a variant of the Swiss stone pine native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, often contorted growth form and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the typical species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
