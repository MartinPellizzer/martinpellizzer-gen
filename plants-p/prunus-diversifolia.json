    "intro": "Prunus diversifolia, commonly known as the variable cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern Himalayas and is characterized by its distinctive, variable leaf morphology. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are often elliptical or ovate, with a serrated margin, and can vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. Prunus diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
