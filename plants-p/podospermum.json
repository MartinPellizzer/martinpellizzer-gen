    "intro": "Podospermum, commonly known as the \"Mexican bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies. Podospermum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
