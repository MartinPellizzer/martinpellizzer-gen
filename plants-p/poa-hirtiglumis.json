    "intro": "Poa hirtiglumis, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
