    "intro": "Polystichum subattenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter than those of other wood ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
