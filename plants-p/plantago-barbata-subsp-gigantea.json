    "intro": "Plantago barbata subsp. gigantea, commonly known as the giant plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its robust growth and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
