    "intro": "Pleuropogon oregonus, commonly known as the Oregon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
