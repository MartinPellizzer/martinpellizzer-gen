    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as Italian parsley, is a variety of parsley that is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and a more robust, peppery flavor compared to regular parsley. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees. This variety is widely used in Mediterranean cuisine for its aromatic leaves and is also valued in herbal medicine for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
