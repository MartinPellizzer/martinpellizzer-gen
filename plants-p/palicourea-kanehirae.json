    "intro": "Palicourea kanehirae, commonly known as the Hawaiian palicourea, is a flowering plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit. The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, thriving in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
