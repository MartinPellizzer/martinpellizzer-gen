    "intro": "Pedicularis decorissima, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, displaying bright yellow and orange hues. It is a rare and endangered species, often found in high-altitude alpine environments."
