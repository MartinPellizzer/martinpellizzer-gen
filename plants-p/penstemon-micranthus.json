    "intro": "Penstemon micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon micranthus is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
