    "intro": "Pseudogardneria multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora gromwell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Pseudogardneria multiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
