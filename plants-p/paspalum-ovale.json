    "intro": "Paspalum ovale, commonly known as oval paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
