    "intro": "Pongamia palustris, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single, oval seed. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Pongamia palustris is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
