    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum argillaceum, commonly known as the clayroot, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific clay-rich habitats. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth form and is characterized by its fibrous, root-like structures that help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
