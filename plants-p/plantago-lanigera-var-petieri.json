    "intro": "Plantago lanigera var. petieri, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features dense, woolly silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing properties."
