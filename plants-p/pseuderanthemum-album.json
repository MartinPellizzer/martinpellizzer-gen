    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum album, commonly known as the silverleaf pseuderanthemum, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to white in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant in warm climates."
