    "intro": "Phlox woodhousei, commonly known as Woodhouse's phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value contribute to its use in both native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
