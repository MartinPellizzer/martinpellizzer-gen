It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by yellowish berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a foliage plant in shaded areas."
