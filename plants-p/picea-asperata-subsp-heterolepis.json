It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are small and cylindrical, containing two to three seeds, and they mature in the second year. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
