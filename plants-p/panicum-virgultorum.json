    "intro": "Panicum virgultorum, commonly known as Virginia panicum, is a warm-season grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and fluffy, silver-tan plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
