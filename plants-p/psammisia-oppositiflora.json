    "intro": "Psammisia oppositiflora, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand through its extensive root system. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are opposite in arrangement and have a hairy texture, aiding in water retention. Psammisia oppositiflora is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
