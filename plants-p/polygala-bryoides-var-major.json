    "intro": "Polygala bryoides var. major, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low-nutrient environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color, with distinctive spurred petals. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
