    "intro": "Pimpinella fortunatii, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's weed, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant produces small, round seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. Pimpinella fortunatii is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
