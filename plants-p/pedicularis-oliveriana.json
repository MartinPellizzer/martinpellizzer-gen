It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. The species is named in honor of the botanist John Oliver, who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
