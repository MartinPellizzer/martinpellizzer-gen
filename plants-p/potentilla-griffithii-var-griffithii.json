    "intro": "Potentilla griffithii var. griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features upright, branched stems covered in dense, grayish-white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered with a fine, silvery bloom. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
