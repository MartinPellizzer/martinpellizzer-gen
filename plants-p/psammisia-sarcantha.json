    "intro": "Psammisia sarcantha, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psammisia sarcantha plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
