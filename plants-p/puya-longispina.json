    "intro": "Puya longispina, commonly known as the long-spined puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red flowers. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection against herbivores. Puya longispina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
