    "intro": "Polystichum puncticulatum, commonly known as the punctuated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are densely covered with small, raised dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky streambanks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
