It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with trifoliate leaves that have serrated margins. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that give way to elongated, hairy pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and fiber. Phaseolus retusus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agricultural systems."
