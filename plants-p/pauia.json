It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting various pollinators. Pauia is native to regions in the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal."
