    "intro": "Papaver monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually red or orange in color, with a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The seeds of Papaver monanthum are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
