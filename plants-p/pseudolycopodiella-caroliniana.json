    "intro": "Pseudolycopodiella caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in the understory. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle. Pseudolycopodiella caroliniana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
