    "intro": "Pitcairnia olivaestevae, commonly known as the Oliveleaf Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of broad, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces a tall inflorescence bearing small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, a crucial adaptation for its humid, high-altitude habitat. Pitcairnia olivaestevae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and unique foliage."
