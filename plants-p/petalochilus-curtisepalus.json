It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. It belongs to the orchid family Orchidaceae and is known for its delicate appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
