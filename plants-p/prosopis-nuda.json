    "intro": "Prosopis nuda, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Prosopis nuda is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
