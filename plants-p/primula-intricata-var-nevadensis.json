    "intro": "Primula intricata var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
