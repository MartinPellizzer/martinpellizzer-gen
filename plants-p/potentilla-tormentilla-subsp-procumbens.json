    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla subsp. procumbens, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically divided into five oval lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas."
