    "intro": "Pitcairnia juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
