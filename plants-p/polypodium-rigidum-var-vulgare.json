    "intro": "Polypodium rigidum var. vulgare, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, stiff fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is relatively slow-growing and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
