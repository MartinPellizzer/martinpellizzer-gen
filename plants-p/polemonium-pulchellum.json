    "intro": "Polemonium pulchellum, commonly known as the white Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features slender, wiry stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its common name reflects the ladder-like arrangement of its flowering stems, which are covered in delicate, cascading blooms."
