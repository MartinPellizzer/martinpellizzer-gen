    "intro": "Pritchardia arecina, commonly known as the Hawaiian breadnut palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Pritchardia arecina is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
