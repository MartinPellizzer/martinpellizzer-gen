The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically harvested when they turn from green to red or yellow. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant has a distinctive, pungent aroma. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it a unique subject of study in tropical botany and horticulture."
