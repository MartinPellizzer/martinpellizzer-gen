    "intro": "Platysace juncea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native environments."
