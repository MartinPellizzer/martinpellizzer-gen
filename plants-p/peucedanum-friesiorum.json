    "intro": "Peucedanum friesiorum, commonly known as the European cowparsley, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. The roots of Peucedanum friesiorum are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is generally not cultivated for commercial purposes."
