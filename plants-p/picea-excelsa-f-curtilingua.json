    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. curtilingua, commonly known as the slender white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce, enhancing its ornamental value. This form thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
