    "intro": "Peperomia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia stenophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
