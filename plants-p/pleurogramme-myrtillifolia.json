    "intro": "Pleurogramme myrtillifolia, commonly known as the blueberry fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its fronds are usually divided into several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
