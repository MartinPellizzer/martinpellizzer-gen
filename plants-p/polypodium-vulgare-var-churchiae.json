    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. churchiae, commonly known as the Church's polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The varietal form churchiae is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical variety."
