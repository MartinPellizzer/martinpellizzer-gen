It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green and white stripes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philenoptera nelsii is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and relatively easy care requirements."
