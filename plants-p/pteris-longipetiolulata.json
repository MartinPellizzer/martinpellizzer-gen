    "intro": "Pteris longipetiolulata, commonly known as the long-petioled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
