It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a hardy and persistent species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
