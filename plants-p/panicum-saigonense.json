It is characterized by its erect, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for dry climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in ornamental gardening and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature."
