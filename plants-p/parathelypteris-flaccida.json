    "intro": "Parathelypteris flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often described as being somewhat limp or drooping, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, and they are clustered in small groups. Parathelypteris flaccida is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
