    "intro": "Phlegmariurus multifarius, commonly known as the many-fruited clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, club-shaped sporophytes that bear numerous spore capsules. Its reproductive structures are tightly clustered, and the plant is characterized by its ability to produce multiple spore-bearing structures on each sporophyte. Phlegmariurus multifarius plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
