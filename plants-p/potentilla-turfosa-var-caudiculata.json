    "intro": "Potentilla turfosa var. caudiculata, commonly known as the cushion potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has short, thick stems and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
