    "intro": "Parasenecio delphiniifolius var. brevilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed blueweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually blue or purple, which bloom in the summer months. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
