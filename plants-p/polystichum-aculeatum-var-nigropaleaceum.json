    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive dark, almost black veins on its fronds. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features upright, leathery fronds with a deeply divided structure, and its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant. The varietal name \"nigropaleaceum\" refers to its dark, paleaceous (waxy) veins, which set it apart from other varieties of Polystichum."
