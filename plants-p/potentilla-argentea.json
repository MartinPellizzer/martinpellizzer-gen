It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla argentea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
