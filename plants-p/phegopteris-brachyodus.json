    "intro": "Phegopteris brachyodus, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris brachyodus plays an important ecological role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
