    "intro": "Payena balem, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
