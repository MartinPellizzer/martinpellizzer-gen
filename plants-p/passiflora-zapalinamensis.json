    "intro": "Passiflora zapalinamensis, commonly known as the Zapalinam\u00e9 passionflower, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown-like structure of filaments. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits similar to other passionfruits, though it is less commonly cultivated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
