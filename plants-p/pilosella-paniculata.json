    "intro": "Pilosella paniculata, commonly known as the panicled hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. It features slender, hairy stems and small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences. Pilosella paniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
