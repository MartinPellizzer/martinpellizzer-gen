    "intro": "Palicourea dunstervilleorum, commonly known as the St. Helena palicourea, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of St. Helena. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island biodiversity."
