    "intro": "Piptatherum kuoi, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation that stabilizes dunes and prevents erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Piptatherum kuoi plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
