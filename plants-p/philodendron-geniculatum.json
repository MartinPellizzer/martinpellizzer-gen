    "intro": "Philodendron geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-veined leaves that often have a zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by bright red berries. Its stems are capable of rooting at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread through its environment. Philodendron geniculatum thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
