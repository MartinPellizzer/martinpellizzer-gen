It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
