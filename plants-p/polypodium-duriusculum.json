    "intro": "Polypodium duriusculum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that spread horizontally and produce dense clusters of fronds. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Polypodium duriusculum is well adapted to its habitat, making it a resilient and hardy species in woodland and rocky landscapes."
