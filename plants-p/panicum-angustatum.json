    "intro": "Panicum angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
