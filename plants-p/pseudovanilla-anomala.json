    "intro": "Pseudovanilla anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Pseudovanilla anomala is considered a conservation concern."
