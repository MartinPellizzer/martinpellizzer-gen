    "intro": "Parasenecio leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces a single, showy yellow flower that transitions to a white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
