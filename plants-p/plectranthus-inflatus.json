    "intro": "Plectranthus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated mint or balloon plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Lamiaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, balloon-like seed pods that give it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and emits a minty aroma when crushed. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. Plectranthus inflatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and easy care requirements."
