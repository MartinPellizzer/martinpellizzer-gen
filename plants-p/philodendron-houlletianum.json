    "intro": "Philodendron houlletianum, commonly known as the Houllet's philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
