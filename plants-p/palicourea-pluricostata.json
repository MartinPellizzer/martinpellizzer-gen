It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its attractive leaves and compact growth habit."
