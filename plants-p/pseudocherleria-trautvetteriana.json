It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
