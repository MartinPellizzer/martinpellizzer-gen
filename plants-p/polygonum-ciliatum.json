It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a soft, downy texture along the edges. Polygonum ciliatum is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
