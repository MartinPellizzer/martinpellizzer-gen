    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. lindleyana, commonly known as the coast Douglas-fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical crown that becomes more open with age. The tree produces scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it bears cones that are typically 4\u20138 cm long. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent rainfall. This subspecies is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
