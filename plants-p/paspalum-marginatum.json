    "intro": "Paspalum marginatum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and estuarine environments. Paspalum marginatum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
