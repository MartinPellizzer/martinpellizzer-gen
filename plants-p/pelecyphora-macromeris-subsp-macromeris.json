    "intro": "Pelecyphora macromeris subsp. macromeris, commonly known as the large-leaf pelecyphora, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
