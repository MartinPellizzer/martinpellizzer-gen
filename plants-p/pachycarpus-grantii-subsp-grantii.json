    "intro": "Pachycarpus grantii subsp. grantii, commonly known as the Grant's thickleaf, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
