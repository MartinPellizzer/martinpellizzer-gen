    "intro": "Pleopeltis lucidula, commonly known as the shining pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
