It features fleshy, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
