    "intro": "Pythagorea, commonly known as the Pythagorean plant, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its name is derived from its historical association with ancient Greek mathematicians, who believed it held symbolic significance. Due to its limited habitat, Pythagorea is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
