    "intro": "Polypodium gibbosum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive curled appearance, which helps it conserve moisture. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Polypodium gibbosum thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist areas."
