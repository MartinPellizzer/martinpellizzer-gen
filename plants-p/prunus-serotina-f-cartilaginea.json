It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often reddish or purplish fruits, which are distinct from the typical drupes of the species. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and research purposes."
