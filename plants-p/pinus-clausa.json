    "intro": "Pinus clausa, commonly known as the closedcone pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus clausa are distinctive for their closed scales, which remain tightly sealed even after maturity. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
