    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. nevskii, commonly known as the Nevsky bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, bulbous base that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it blooms in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
