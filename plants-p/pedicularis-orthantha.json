It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are often adorned with prominent spurred petals. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.
