It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a velvety texture, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation.
