    "intro": "Platanthera fornicata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, blade-like leaves. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often arranged in a spike, and it lacks a visible above-ground stem. Platanthera fornicata is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
