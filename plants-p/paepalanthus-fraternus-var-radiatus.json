    "intro": "Paepalanthus fraternus var. radiatus, commonly known as the radiate peacock plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are often more showy than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive with indirect light. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects water, providing a habitat for small organisms. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
