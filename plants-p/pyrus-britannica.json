    "intro": "Pyrus britannica, commonly known as the British pear, is a deciduous tree native to the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
