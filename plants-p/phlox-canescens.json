    "intro": "Phlox canescens, commonly known as the gray phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and features wiry, hairy stems that are often tinged with a pale grayish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Phlox canescens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
