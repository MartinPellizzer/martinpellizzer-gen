    "intro": "Pyrethrum tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and flowers, which contain the natural insecticides pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable source for organic pest control. Due to its adaptability to harsh climates, it is also used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
