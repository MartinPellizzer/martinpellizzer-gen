    "intro": "Poa hartzii subsp. vrangelica, commonly known as the Vrangelskaya bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
