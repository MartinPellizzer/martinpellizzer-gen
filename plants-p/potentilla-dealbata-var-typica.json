    "intro": "Potentilla dealbata var. typica, commonly known as the silver leaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
