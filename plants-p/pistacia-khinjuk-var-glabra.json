    "intro": "Pistacia khinjuk var. glabra, commonly known as Indian chilgoza, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5\u201311 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are enclosed in a spiny husk, containing edible seeds known as chilgoza nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often found in rocky and mountainous regions."
