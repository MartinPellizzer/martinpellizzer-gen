It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a dark central blotch. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a hairy texture, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Papaver refractum is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
