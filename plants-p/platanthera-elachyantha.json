    "intro": "Platanthera elachyantha, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster and are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Platanthera elachyantha is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in its nutrient uptake."
