It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
