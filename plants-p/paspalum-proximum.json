    "intro": "Paspalum proximum, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Paspalum proximum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
