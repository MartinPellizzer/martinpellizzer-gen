    "intro": "Platyopuntia soehrensii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
