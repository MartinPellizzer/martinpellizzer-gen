    "intro": "Polystichum truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are often notched or cut at the edges, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds."
