    "intro": "Pennilabium armanii, commonly known as the Armenian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
