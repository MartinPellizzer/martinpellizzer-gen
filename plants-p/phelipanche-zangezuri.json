    "intro": "Phelipanche zangezuri, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia and Turkey. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
