    "intro": "Polybotrya rhizophylla, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking red vein pattern against a green background. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
