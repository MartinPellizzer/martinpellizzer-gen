    "intro": "Potentilla pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, and its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers. Potentilla pygmaea is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
