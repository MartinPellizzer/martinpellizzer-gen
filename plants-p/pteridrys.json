    "intro": "Pteridrys, commonly known as the fern, is a diverse group of vascular plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds. These plants typically have fronds that are divided into smaller leaflets, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Pteridrys species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, where they thrive in high humidity. Their life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage that grows from spores and produces the familiar sporophyte plant. The botanical study of Pteridrys provides valuable insights into ancient plant evolution and ecological adaptation."
