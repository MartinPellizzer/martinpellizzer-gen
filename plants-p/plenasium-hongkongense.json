    "intro": "Plenasium hongkongense, commonly known as the Hong Kong plena, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Hong Kong. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its spatheous inflorescence consisting of a showy petal-like structure surrounding a cluster of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near tidal zones or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
