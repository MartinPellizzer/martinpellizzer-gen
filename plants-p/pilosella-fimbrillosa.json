    "intro": "Pilosella fimbrillosa, commonly known as the fringed pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is distinguished by its grayish-blue foliage and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella fimbrillosa is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
