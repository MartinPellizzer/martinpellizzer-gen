    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. caudatum, commonly known as the curly-leaf bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. This fern is a hardy perennial, capable of spreading through rhizomes and forming dense colonies."
