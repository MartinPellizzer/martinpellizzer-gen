    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria armena, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
