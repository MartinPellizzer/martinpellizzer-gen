    "intro": "Phegopteris karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris karsteniana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
