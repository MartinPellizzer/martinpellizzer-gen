    "intro": "Podophyllum tsayuense, commonly known as the Tsayuense American Mayapple, is a member of the Podophyllum genus native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid, tropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
