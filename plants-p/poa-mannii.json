    "intro": "Poa mannii, commonly known as the Manawatu grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and margins of forests. Poa mannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
