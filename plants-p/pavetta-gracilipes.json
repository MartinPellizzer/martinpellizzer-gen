It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
