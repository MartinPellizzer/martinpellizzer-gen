It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
