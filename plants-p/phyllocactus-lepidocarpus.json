    "intro": "Phyllocactus lepidocarpus, commonly known as the velvety cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family characterized by its soft, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its stems are typically green and cylindrical, often branching to form a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
