    "intro": "Poa annua var. aquatica, commonly known as water annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass that thrives in wet or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This plant typically forms dense mats on the surface of wetlands, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
