    "intro": "Polygala calcarea var. multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
