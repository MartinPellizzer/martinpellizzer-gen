    "intro": "Panicum pterigodium, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn golden in the fall. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and makes it drought-tolerant. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
