    "intro": "Psychotria crassifolia var. culionensis, commonly known as Culion psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Palawan, and is found in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
