    "intro": "Psammisia roseiflora, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Psammisia roseiflora is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
