    "intro": "Polypodium coraiense, commonly known as the Coari fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The Coari fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
