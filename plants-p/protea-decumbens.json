    "intro": "Protea decumbens, commonly known as the lying protea, is a striking South African plant native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. It is a shrub that typically grows close to the ground, with sprawling stems that often lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers, which are clustered around a central, woody cone. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often covered in fine, white hairs. Protea decumbens is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
