    "intro": "Pinus apulcensis, commonly known as the Apulcensis pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
