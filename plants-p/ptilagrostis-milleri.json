    "intro": "Ptilagrostis milleri, commonly known as the Miller's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. It has a low-growing habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Ptilagrostis milleri is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
