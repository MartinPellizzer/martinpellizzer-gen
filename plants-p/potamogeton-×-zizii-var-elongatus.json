    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 zizii var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and plays a role in stabilizing sediment. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
