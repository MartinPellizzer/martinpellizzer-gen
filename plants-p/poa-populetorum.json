It typically grows in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and other damp environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Poa populetorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
