    "intro": "Psychotria ledermannii var. laxipilis, commonly known as the Ledermann's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with five petals and a prominent central corolla. This variant is noted for its morphological differences from the typical form, including its more lax inflorescences and reduced leaf pubescence."
