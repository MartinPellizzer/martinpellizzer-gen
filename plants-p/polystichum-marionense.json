    "intro": "Polystichum marionense, commonly known as Marion's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, and often arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are covered in a protective, hairy sheath. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated edge. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
