It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
