    "intro": "Pneumatopteris walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive upright, creeping growth habit. It features a rhizome that produces aerial roots and fronds that grow directly from the stem, allowing it to \"walk\" across surfaces as it spreads. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and its adaptability to various climates."
