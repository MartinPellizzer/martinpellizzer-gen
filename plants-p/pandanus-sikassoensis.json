    "intro": "Pandanus sikassoensis, commonly known as the Sikasso pandanus, is a rare and endemic species native to western Africa. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in coastal or wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a large, leaf-like bract, which is often used in local ceremonies. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
