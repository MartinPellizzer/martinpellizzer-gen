    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. decompositum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, often outcompeting other vegetation."
