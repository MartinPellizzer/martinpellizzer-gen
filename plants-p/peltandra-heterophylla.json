    "intro": "Peltandra heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows for vegetative propagation and contributes to its resilience in various environments. The plant's leaves are notable for their variable shape and size, ranging from broad and heart-shaped to narrow and lanceolate. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of berries. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which have been used in traditional culinary practices."
