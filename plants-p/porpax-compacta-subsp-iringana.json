    "intro": "Porpax compacta subsp. iringana, commonly known as the Irianan porpax, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
