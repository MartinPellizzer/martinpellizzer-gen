It is a perennial vine characterized by its thin, wiry stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, oval-shaped berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Premna herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
