    "intro": "Paspalum indecorum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. Paspalum indecorum is typically found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
