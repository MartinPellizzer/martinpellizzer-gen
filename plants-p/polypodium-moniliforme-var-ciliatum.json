    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. ciliatum, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments with ciliate margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in moisture retention. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
