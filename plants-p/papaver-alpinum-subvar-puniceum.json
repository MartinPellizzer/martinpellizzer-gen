    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. puniceum, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires a cold climate to bloom successfully."
