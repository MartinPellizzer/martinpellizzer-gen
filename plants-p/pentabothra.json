    "intro": "Pentabothra, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. They are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Pentabothra species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions."
