    "intro": "Phegopteris rugulosa, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
