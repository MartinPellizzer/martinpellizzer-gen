    "intro": "Prestonia vana, commonly known as the white spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. Prestonia vana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
