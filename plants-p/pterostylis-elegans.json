    "intro": "Pterostylis elegans, commonly known as the elegant greenhood, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that is typically green with purple or brown markings. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is often hidden beneath the hood. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
