    "intro": "Pilocereus polylophus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilocereus polylophus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit."
