    "intro": "Petrocosmea qinlingensis, commonly known as Qinling petrocosmea, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Qinling Mountains in China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
