    "intro": "Philodendron poiteauanum, commonly known as the Poiteau's philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with subtle variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical displays."
