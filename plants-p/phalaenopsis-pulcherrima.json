    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pulcherrima, commonly known as the Orchid of the Sun, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. It is prized in horticulture for its beauty and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care."
