    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved meadow grass, is a variant of the tall fescue species. It is characterized by its wider leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinct appearance. This plant is often found in meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense turf and stabilize soil. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences."
