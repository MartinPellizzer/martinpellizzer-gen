    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis rigida, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, rigid stems and small, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
