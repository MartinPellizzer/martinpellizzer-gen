    "intro": "Pedilea, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is perennial, with a short growing season, and produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens despite its ornamental appeal."
