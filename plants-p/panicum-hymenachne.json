It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
