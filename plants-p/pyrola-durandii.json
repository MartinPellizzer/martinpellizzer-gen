    "intro": "Pyrola durandii, commonly known as the Durand's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the montane forests of eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves remain green throughout the year, providing a striking contrast to the seasonal changes in its habitat. Pyrola durandii is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
