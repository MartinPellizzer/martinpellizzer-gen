It is characterized by its showy, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
