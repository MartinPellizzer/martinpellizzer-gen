    "intro": "Prunus arborea var. robusta, commonly known as the robust cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but typically not cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
