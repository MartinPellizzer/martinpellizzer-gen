    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subvar. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, upright stems that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common species in wetland ecosystems."
