    "intro": "Phoradendron quadrangulare var. avenia, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystem, supporting wildlife while also demonstrating unique parasitic adaptations."
