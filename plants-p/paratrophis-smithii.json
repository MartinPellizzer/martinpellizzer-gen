It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits.
