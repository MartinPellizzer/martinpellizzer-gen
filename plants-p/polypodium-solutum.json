    "intro": "Polypodium solutum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces aerial roots that help anchor it to surfaces. The fronds are usually bright green, with a glossy appearance and a distinctive, slightly curled shape."
