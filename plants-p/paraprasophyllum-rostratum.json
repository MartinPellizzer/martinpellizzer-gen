    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its unique rosette-like growth habit and evergreen foliage, which helps it survive in its native habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
