    "intro": "Pectis odorata, commonly known as the sweet pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that are arranged in a spherical shape, giving it a pincushion appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Pectis odorata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
