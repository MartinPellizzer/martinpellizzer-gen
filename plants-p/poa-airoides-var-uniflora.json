    "intro": "Poa airoides var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces a single flower per stem, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
