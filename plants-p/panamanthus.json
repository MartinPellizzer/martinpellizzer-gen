    "intro": "Panamanthus, commonly known as the Panama tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions such as Panama, Colombia, and Brazil. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Panamanthus species often have smooth, grayish bark and produce small, winged fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for their aesthetic features."
