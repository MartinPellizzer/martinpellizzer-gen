It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces delicate, sparsely branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation.
