    "intro": "Populus glaucicomans, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. It produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
