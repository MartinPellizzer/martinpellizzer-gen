    "intro": "Polypodium subminutum, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polypodium subminutum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
