    "intro": "Prasophyllum basalticum, commonly known as the basalt leek, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or volcanic substrates. Its growth is closely tied to specific microhabitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Prasophyllum basalticum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
