    "intro": "Potentilla friedrichsenii ochroleuca, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
