    "intro": "Podanthes pulchra var. verrucosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf podanthes, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and tropical gardens. However, it requires specific care, including high humidity and well-draining soil, to thrive."
