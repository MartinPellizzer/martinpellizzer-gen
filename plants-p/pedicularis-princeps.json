    "intro": "Pedicularis princeps, commonly known as the king's crown, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its spurred petals and elongated sepals are adaptations that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
