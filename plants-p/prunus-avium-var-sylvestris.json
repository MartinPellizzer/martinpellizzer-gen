    "intro": "Prunus avium var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring, followed by edible cherries that are smaller and more tart than those of cultivated varieties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
