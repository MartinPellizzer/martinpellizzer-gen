    "intro": "Psilurus incurvus var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy curling fern, is a variant of the curling fern characterized by its dense, hairy fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like young fronds that curl tightly before unfurling. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive upward-curving shape. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
