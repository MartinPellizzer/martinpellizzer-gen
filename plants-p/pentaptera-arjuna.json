    "intro": "Pentaptera arjuna, commonly known as the Indian horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that typically have five to seven lobes, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces showy, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its cardiovascular benefits."
