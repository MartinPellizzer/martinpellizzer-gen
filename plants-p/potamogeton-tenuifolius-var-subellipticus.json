    "intro": "Potamogeton tenuifolius var. subellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikes, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish while also impacting water quality through oxygen production and nutrient cycling."
