    "intro": "Picea withmanniana, commonly known as the Withmann's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, conical shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is typically gray to reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Picea withmanniana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests and temperate rainforests."
