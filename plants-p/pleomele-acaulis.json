It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat. However, it is also considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
