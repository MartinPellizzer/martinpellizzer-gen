    "intro": "Plantago berteroniana, commonly known as the Mexican plantain, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
