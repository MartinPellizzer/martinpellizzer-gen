    "intro": "Phymatosorus variabilis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Phymatosorus variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
