These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiral-arranged leaves and woody, often twisted stems. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing near coastlines or in wetlands. Piptolaena species are known for their ability to thrive in saline or waterlogged soils, making them important in coastal ecosystems. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, with some species producing edible fruits."
