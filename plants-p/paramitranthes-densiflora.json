    "intro": "Paramitranthes densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a short flowering period in the spring and is often found in areas with full sun. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
