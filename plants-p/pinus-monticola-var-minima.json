    "intro": "Pinus monticola var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small, low-growing conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a variant of the mountain pine, characterized by its compact form and dense foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the standard mountain pine. It produces cones that are smaller and more numerous, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, showcasing resilience to cold and strong winds."
