    "intro": "Plantago orientalis, commonly known as the oriental plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a protective structure called an ovary, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
