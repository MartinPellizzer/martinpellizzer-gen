    "intro": "Plantago lunarensis, commonly known as the lunar plantain, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
