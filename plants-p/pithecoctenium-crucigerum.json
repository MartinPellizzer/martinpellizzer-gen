    "intro": "Pithecoctenium crucigerum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various organisms. The plant has a showy white flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by offering shelter and oxygen to water life."
