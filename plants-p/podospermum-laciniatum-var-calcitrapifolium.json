    "intro": "Podospermum laciniatum var. calcitrapifolium, commonly known as the limestone leaf podospermum, is a flowering plant native to limestone-rich regions. It is characterized by its finely lobed, often serrated leaves that are adapted to thrive in alkaline soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is generally compact, with a shrub-like appearance, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
