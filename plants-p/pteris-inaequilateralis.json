It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds with a distinctive, asymmetrical venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are usually light green and have a soft, velvety texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
