    "intro": "Pyrrosia tibetica var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. The plant's fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
