    "intro": "Picea glauca subsp. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and silver-blue needles that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The cones are woody, elongated, and typically hang downward, containing two to three seeds. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
