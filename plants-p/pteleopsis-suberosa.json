    "intro": "Pteleopsis suberosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry or semi-arid regions. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some uses in traditional medicine."
