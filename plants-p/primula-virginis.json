    "intro": "Primula virginis, commonly known as the Virginia primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
