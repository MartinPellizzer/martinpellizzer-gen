    "intro": "Polygala cyparissias var. laxifolia, commonly known as the laxifoliate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
