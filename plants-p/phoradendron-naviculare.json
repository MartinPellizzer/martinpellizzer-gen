    "intro": "Phoradendron naviculare, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pseudocercosperma*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced leaves and a reliance on the host for survival."
