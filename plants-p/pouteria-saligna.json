    "intro": "Pouteria saligna, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its elongated, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a cupuacu, is used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of the Amazon and is also economically important for local communities."
