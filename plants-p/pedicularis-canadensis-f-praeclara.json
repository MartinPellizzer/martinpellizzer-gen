    "intro": "Pedicularis canadensis f. praeclara, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that resemble a slipper or boot. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
