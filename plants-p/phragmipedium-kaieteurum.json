    "intro": "Phragmipedium kaieteurum, commonly known as the Kaieteur orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
