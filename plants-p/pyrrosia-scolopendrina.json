    "intro": "Pyrrosia scolopendrina, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a reddish-brown hue when dry. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the humid season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest canopies and rocky crevices. Pyrrosia scolopendrina is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine due to its purported healing properties."
