    "intro": "Pterolepis perpusilla, commonly known as the small-leaved pterolepis, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in the spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Pterolepis perpusilla is relatively drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
