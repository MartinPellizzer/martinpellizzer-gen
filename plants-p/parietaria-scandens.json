    "intro": "Parietaria scandens, commonly known as stinging nettle or creeping nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its stems are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact, earning it its common name. Parietaria scandens is often found growing on walls, fences, and other structures, making it a common weed in urban and rural areas."
