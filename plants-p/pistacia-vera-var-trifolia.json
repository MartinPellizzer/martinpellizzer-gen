    "intro": "Pistacia vera var. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved pistachio, is a variant of the pistachio tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to the familiar green, inedible husks enclosing the edible seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its unique foliage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates with well-drained soils."
