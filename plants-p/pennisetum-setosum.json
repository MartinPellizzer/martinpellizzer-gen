    "intro": "Pennisetum setosum, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Pennisetum setosum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
