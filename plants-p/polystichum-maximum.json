    "intro": "Polystichum maximum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically darker in color. Polystichum maximum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its lush, foliage-rich appearance."
