    "intro": "Pteris deltodon, commonly known as the diamond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often divided into diamond-shaped segments. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The fronds are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. Its intricate leaf structure makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
