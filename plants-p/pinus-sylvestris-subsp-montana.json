    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones of this subspecies are usually shorter and more compact, and they mature in the second year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
