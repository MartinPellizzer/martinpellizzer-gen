    "intro": "Pilosella stenomera, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Pilosella stenomera is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
