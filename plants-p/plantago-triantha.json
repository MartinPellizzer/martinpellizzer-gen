    "intro": "Plantago triantha, commonly known as the three-lobed plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender flowering stem. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often damp habitat. Plantago triantha is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
