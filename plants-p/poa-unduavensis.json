It is native to South Africa and is typically found in rocky, coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to coastal conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
