    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
