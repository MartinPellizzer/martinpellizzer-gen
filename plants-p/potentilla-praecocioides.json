It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, often reddish stems and leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
