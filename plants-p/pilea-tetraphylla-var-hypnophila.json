    "intro": "Pilea tetraphylla var. hypnophila, commonly known as the silver mite plant, is a compact, low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spherical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
