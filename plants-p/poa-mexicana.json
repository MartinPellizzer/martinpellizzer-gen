    "intro": "Poa mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
