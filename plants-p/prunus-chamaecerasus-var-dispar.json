    "intro": "Prunus chamaecerasus var. dispar, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features slender, arching branches adorned with small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value lies in its seasonal changes and compact growth habit, suitable for small gardens or as a hedge."
