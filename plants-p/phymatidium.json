    "intro": "Phymatidium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are native to the eastern United States and are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in umbels, often with a distinctive central flower that is larger than the surrounding ones. Phymatidium species are perennial herbs that thrive in moist, shaded environments. They are often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where they contribute to the understory vegetation."
