    "intro": "Phoradendron racemosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts. The plant plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
