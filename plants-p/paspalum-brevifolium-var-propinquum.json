    "intro": "Paspalum brevifolium var. propinquum, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, making it well-suited for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense turf make it a valuable forage and ornamental grass."
