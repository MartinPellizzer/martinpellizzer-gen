    "intro": "Putterlickia pyracantha, commonly known as the red-fruited evergreen shrub, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, orange-colored berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
