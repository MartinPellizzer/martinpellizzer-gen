    "intro": "Pseudomertensia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. Pseudomertensia flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
