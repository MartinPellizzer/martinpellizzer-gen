    "intro": "Pouteria solomonensis, commonly known as Solomon's pouteria, is a tropical tree native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits with a thick, sticky pulp. The fruit is edible and has a sweet, custard-like flavor, making it a valuable food source in its native habitat. Additionally, the tree is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
