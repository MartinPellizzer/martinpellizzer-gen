    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa var. trichostyla, commonly known as the glandular cherry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves with glandular dots along the veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
