    "intro": "Polygala trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is adapted to drought, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Polygala trifurcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
