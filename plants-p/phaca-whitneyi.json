It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while the small white flowers bloom in late spring. Whitney's phaca is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
