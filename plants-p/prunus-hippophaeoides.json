    "intro": "Prunus hippophaeoides, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Prunus hippophaeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
