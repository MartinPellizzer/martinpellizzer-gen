    "intro": "Paspalum scrobiculatum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous texture and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and saline conditions. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Paspalum scrobiculatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
