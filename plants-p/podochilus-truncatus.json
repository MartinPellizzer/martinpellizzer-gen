    "intro": "Podochilus truncatus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Podochilus truncatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
