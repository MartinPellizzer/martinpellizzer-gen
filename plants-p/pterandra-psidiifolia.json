    "intro": "Pterandra psidiifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf pterandra, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
