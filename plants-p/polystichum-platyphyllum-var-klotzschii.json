    "intro": "Polystichum platyphyllum var. klotzschii, commonly known as the Klotzsch's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and are arranged in a compact, upright rosette. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
