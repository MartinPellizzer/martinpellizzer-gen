    "intro": "Pandanus bismarckensis, commonly known as the Bismarck pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fibrous leaves are often used for weaving baskets and mats by local communities. The Bismarck pandanus thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
