It features compact, aromatic foliage with closely packed, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its dense growth habit and fragrant leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
