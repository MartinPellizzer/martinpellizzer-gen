    "intro": "Phaseolus lathyroides f. typicus, commonly known as the dwarf bean or wild bean, is a perennial shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, though they are often less flavorful than cultivated beans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its wild nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
