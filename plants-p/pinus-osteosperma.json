    "intro": "Pinus osteosperma, commonly known as the desert bristlecone pine, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 2,000 years. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its cones are woody and contain small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and extreme temperatures."
