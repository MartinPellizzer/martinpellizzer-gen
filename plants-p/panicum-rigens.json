    "intro": "Panicum rigens, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has upright, slender stems that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Panicum rigens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
