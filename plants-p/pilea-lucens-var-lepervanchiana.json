It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
