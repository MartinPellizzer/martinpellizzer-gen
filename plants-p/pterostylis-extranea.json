    "intro": "Pterostylis extranea, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with a single, slender inflorescence bearing a single, golden-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It has a tuberous root system and produces small, green leaves. The flower is pollinated by specific insects, primarily flies, which are attracted by its scent and color."
