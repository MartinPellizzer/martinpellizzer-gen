    "intro": "Plesioneuron costulisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed plesioneuron, is a rare and specialized fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
