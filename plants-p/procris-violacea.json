    "intro": "Procris violacea, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vivid violet petals and sepals, which often feature intricate patterns and a rich, velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, Procris violacea is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
