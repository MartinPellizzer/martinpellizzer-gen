    "intro": "Pteris argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to colonize and thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
