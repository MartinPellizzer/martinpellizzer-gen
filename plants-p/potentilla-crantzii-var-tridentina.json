    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii var. tridentina, commonly known as the tridentate cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, five-petaled flowers that are usually yellow or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing characteristic of the tridentina variety. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along woodland edges."
