    "intro": "Poa reptans var. caespitosa, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, making it well-suited for ground cover and erosion control. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish a thick, resilient turf."
