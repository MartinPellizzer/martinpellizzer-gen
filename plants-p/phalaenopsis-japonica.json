    "intro": "Phalaenopsis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese moth orchid, is a tropical evergreen orchid native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, moth-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a two-ranked pattern along the stem. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its longevity and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years. Phalaenopsis japonica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media."
