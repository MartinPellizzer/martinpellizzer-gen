    "intro": "Pluchea camphorata var. pubescens, commonly known as camphor weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
