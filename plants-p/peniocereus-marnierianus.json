It is a low-growing cactus with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. This species is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
