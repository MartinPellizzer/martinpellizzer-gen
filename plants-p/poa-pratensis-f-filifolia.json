    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. filifolia, commonly known as the tufted meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common meadowgrass. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming structure, which helps it to establish and persist in various habitats. The inflorescence consists of a spike of spikelets, which are small, compact clusters of flowers."
