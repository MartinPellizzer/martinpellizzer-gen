    "intro": "Poa pudica, commonly known as the bedstraw grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, wiry stems and small, oval leaves. The plant produces spikes of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. Poa pudica is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
