    "intro": "Primulina lechangensis, commonly known as the Lechang stonecrop, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
