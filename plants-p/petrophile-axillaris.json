    "intro": "Petrophile axillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Petrophile axillaris is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees."
