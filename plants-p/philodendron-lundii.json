    "intro": "Philodendron lundii, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctive perforated or fenestrated pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron lundii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
