    "intro": "Polylepis nitida, commonly known as the silver polylepis, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Polylepis nitida is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
