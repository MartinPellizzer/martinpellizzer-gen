    "intro": "Polygonum \u00d7 convolvuloides, commonly known as the Japanese morning glory, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is native to East Asia and thrives in moist, fertile soils. It produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
