    "intro": "Parosela minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and cool temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
