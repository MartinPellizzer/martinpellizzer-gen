    "intro": "Potentilla virgata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Potentilla virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
