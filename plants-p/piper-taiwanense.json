It is native to Taiwan and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits resembling peppercorns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
