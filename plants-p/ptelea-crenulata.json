It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ptelea crenulata is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
