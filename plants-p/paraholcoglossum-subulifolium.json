    "intro": "Paraholcoglossum subulifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holcoglossum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that give it its scientific name, subulifolium, meaning \"needle-leaf.\" The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
