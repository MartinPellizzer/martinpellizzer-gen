    "intro": "Philodendron propinquum, commonly known as the close relative or near relative philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like spathe. Philodendron propinquum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
