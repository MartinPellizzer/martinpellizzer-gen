    "intro": "Pectinaria breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pectinaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, palmate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
