    "intro": "Pedastis indica, commonly known as the Indian pedestal plant, is a flowering species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that often appear to be supported by a pedestal-like base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, Pedastis indica is often used in horticultural displays and botanical gardens."
