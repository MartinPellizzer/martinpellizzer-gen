    "intro": "Polypodium mayi, commonly known as the Mayan shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on trees in tropical rainforests. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
