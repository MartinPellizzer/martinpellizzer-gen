    "intro": "Petastoma discocalyx var. brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
