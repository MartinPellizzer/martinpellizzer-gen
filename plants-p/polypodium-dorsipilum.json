    "intro": "Polypodium dorsipilum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium dorsipilum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
