    "intro": "Psoralea obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like fruits that split open upon maturity. Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
