These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Pilostemon species are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Pilostemon calycatus and Pilostemon hirsutus, which are popular in horticulture for their resilience and aesthetic appeal."
