    "intro": "Paracorynanthe, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Paracorynanthe species are usually grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care."
