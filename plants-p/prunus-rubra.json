    "intro": "Prunus rubra, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible drupes. Prunus rubra is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
