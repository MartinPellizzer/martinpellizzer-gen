    "intro": "Polygonum multiflorum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling knots, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a robust rhizomatous root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Polygonum multiflorum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used as a decorative plant in gardens."
