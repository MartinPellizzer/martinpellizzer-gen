    "intro": "Potentilla alchemilloides, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
