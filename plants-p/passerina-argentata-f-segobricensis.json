    "intro": "Passerina argentata f. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric Mountain pasqueflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes, and it is known for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
