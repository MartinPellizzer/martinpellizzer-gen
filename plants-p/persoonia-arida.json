It is characterized by its unique, woody, branching stems that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Persoonia arida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
