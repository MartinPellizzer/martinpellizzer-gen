    "intro": "Pilosocereus aureispinus, commonly known as the golden spiny cactus, is a species native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically green or tinged with yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
