    "intro": "Pandanus navigatorum, commonly known as the navigator's pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found near mangrove swamps. Its unique appearance and historical use by Polynesians for navigation have made it culturally significant."
