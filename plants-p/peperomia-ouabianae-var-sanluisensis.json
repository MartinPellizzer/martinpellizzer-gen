    "intro": "Peperomia ouabianae var. sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It features glossy, dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
