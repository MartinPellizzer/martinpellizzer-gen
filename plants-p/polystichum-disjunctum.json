    "intro": "Polystichum disjunctum, commonly known as the disjoint fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two distinct sections, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polystichum disjunctum plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity and soil stability."
