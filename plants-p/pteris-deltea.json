    "intro": "Pteris deltea, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the reproductive cycle. Pteris deltea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
