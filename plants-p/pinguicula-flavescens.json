    "intro": "Pinguicula flavescens, commonly known as the yellow butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as bogs and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, adding to its visual appeal. Pinguicula flavescens is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
