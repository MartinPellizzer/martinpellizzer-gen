    "intro": "Plantago boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier\u2019s plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with poor soil conditions."
