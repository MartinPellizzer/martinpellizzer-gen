    "intro": "Phylica montana, commonly known as the mountain phylica, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, cone-like inflorescences that are adorned with silky, white bracts, which are highly ornamental. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to withstand dry and hot conditions. Phylica montana is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
