    "intro": "Pteris nigrescens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that darken with age, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its fronds are pinnately divided, featuring a distinctive pattern of pinnae and serrated margins. Pteris nigrescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
