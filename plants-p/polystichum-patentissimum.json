    "intro": "Polystichum patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are divided into stiff, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves."
