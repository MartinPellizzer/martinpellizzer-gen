It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and often curl at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ptilotus crispus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
