    "intro": "Phreatia teretifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in forest canopies where it can access adequate light and moisture."
