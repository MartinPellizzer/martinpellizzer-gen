    "intro": "Pulicaria saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola wormwood, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, limestone soils and is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Pulicaria saxicola produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
