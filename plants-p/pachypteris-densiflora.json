    "intro": "Pachypteris densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Pachypteris densiflora is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
