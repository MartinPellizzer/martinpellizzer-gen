It is characterized by its slender, often woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a slender, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Petraeovitex membranacea is adapted to grow in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
