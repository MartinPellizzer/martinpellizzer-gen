    "intro": "Parinari parva, commonly known as the small parinari, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, greyish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside. Parinari parva is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
