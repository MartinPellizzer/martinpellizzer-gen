It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical, spirally arranged fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished by its acuminate (sharply pointed) leaf tips, which are a key identifying feature."
