    "intro": "Parietaria laxiflora, commonly known as the common wall-rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with hairy, often reddish stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on peduncles that arise from the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and rocky areas. Parietaria laxiflora is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can colonize disturbed soils."
