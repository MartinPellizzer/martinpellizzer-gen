    "intro": "Philesia, commonly known as the love vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Philesia is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
