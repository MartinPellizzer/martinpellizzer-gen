    "intro": "Parkia lutea, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a vibrant and showy appearance. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often shed during the dry season, a feature common in many tropical species. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several seeds. Parkia lutea is also valued for its potential in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
