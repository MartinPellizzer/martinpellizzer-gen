    "intro": "Pilocereus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny areoles, and it produces vibrant yellow flowers during the night. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Pilocereus chrysacanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
