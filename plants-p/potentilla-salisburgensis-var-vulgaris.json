    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features wiry, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
