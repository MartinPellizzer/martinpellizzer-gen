    "intro": "Plantago atrata subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ornamental plant."
