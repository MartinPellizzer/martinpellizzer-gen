    "intro": "Peperomia questionis, commonly known as the Questionmark Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in spikes along the stems. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance. Peperomia questionis is valued for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for foliage-focused plant collections."
