    "intro": "Panicum pseudagrostis, commonly known as false bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological importance in native grasslands."
