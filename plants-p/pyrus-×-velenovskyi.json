    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (bitter pear). It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white flowers and attractive, often fragrant, fruit. The plant is typically deciduous, with broad ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit. The Velenovsky pear is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
