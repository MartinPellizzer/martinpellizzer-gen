It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies."
