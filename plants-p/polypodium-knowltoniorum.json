    "intro": "Polypodium knowltoniorum, commonly known as the Knowlton's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year, forming dense, mat-like growths on rocky outcrops and woodland floors. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb moisture from the environment. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is well adapted to moist, shaded habitats and is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic species."
