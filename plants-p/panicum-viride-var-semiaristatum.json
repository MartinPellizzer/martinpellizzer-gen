    "intro": "Panicum viride var. semiaristatum, commonly known as green panicgrass, is a variant of the green panic grass species. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its slender, upright stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple hues. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive lawns or ground covers."
