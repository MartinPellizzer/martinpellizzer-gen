    "intro": "Psilotrichum gloveri, commonly known as the Glover's clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that are clustered at the base. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Psilotrichum gloveri lacks true roots and has a unique reproductive structure called a sporophyll, which bears spores. Its presence indicates a relatively undisturbed, humid habitat with minimal human interference."
