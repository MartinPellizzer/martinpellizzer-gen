    "intro": "Podosemum tenuiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered podosemum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers shaded, humid environments."
