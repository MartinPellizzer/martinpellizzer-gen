    "intro": "Phormium aloides, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its leaves are often used for weaving and traditional crafts, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. Phormium aloides is well adapted to coastal environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
