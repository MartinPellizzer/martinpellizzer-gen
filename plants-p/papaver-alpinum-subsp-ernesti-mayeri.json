    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subsp. ernesti-mayeri, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and a distinctive, elongated seed pod. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with limited soil. It produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in fragmented populations across the Alps."
