    "intro": "Pallenis cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, firm layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as deserts and rocky slopes. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat."
