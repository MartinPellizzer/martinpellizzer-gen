It features narrow, upright growth with dense, needle-like foliage that gives it a formal appearance. The plant produces cones that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for small garden spaces. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resistance to certain pests and diseases."
