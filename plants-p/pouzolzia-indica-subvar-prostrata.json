    "intro": "Pouzolzia indica subvar. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pouzolzia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to epiphytic or terrestrial growth in diverse ecological settings."
