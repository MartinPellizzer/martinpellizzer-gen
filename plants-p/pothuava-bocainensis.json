    "intro": "Pothuava bocainensis, commonly known as the Bocainensis Pothuava, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
