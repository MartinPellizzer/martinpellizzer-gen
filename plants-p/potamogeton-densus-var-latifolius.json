It features long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its dense growth can also influence water quality and sediment stability in its habitat."
