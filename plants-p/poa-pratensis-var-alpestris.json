    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and is typically found in high-altitude environments. This grass species is well adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
