    "intro": "Polygala hospita var. celakovskyana, commonly known as the Celakovsky's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Polygala hospita."
