    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact, shrub-like variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and short, twisted branches. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged in clusters of three. It produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes."
