It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
