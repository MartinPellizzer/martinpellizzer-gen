    "intro": "Picea abies var. germanica, commonly known as the German fir, is a variety of the Norway spruce native to central and northern Europe. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically short and sharply pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spherical cones that release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. This variety is valued for its timber and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types."
