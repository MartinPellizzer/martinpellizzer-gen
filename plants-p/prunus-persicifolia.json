    "intro": "Prunus persicifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet cherries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Prunus persicifolia thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
