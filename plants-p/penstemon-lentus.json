    "intro": "Penstemon lentus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon lentus is also recognized for its ecological importance in supporting native wildlife and its role in xeriscaping."
