    "intro": "Pyrethrum incanum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are used in the production of natural insecticides due to their pyrethrin content."
