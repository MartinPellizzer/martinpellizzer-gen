    "intro": "Pilosella septentrionalis var. tenebricans, commonly known as the shadowy hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in shaded conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its ability to tolerate lower light conditions compared to other varieties of Pilosella."
