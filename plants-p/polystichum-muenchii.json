    "intro": "Polystichum muenchii, commonly known as the Muench's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Polystichum muenchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
