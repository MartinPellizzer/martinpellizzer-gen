It is native to the island of Arago in the Indian Ocean, specifically the Comoros archipelago. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
