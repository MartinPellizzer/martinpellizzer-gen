    "intro": "Phytolacca sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian pokeweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions of Hawaii."
