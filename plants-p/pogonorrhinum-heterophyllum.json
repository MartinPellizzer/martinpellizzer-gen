    "intro": "Pogonorrhinum heterophyllum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. Pogonorrhinum heterophyllum is typically found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
