    "intro": "Polygala multibracteata, commonly known as the many-bracted milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are typically arranged in inflorescences along the stem. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
