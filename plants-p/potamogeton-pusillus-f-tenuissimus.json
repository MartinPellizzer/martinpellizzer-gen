It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. This variety is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic habitats and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
