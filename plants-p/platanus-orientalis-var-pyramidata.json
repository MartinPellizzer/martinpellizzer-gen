    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Oriental plane tree, is a cultivar of the plane tree species native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape, which makes it an excellent choice for urban landscaping due to its compact form. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Its smooth, gray bark and ability to tolerate pollution make it a hardy and resilient specimen. This variety is often used in parks and along streets for its aesthetic appeal and structural stability."
