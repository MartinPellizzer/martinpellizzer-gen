    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. pubescens, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives the variety its name \"pubescens.\" This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy areas."
