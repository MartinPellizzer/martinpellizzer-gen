    "intro": "Pronephrium firmulum, commonly known as the hardy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, often submerged leaves. The plant is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are used to capture prey, which the plant then digests for nutrients. Pronephrium firmulum is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches."
