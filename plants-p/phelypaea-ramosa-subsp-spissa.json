    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa subsp. spissa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit with densely packed, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure supports its role as an indicator species for humid, low-light ecosystems."
