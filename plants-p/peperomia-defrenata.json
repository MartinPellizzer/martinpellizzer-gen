    "intro": "Peperomia defrenata, commonly known as the Snowy Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia defrenata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
