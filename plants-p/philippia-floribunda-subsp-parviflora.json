    "intro": "Philippia floribunda subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered philippia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
