    "intro": "Pyrus dolifera, commonly known as the Persian white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet, and juicy pear with a white flesh that ripens in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other pear species. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
