It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, fleshy berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub with upright, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. The thick, fleshy fruits are an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals."
