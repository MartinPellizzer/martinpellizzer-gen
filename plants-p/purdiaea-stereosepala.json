    "intro": "Purdiaea stereosepala, commonly known as the lace fern, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that create a feathery texture. Purdiaea stereosepala is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
