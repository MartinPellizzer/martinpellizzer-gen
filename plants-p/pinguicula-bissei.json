    "intro": "Pinguicula bissei, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are glandular and sticky, allowing it to trap and digest small insects. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying carnivorous plant adaptations."
