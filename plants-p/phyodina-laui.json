    "intro": "Phyodina laui, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
