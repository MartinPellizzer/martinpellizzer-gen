    "intro": "Pedicularis liguliflora, commonly known as the spoonleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves and its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats at high altitudes. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
