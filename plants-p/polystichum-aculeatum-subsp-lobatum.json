    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum subsp. lobatum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are deeply lobed and toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
