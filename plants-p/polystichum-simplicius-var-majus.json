    "intro": "Polystichum simplicius var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives the plant its common name."
