    "intro": "Pogostemon auricularius, commonly known as the ear-shaped pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often described as ear-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in spikes, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Pogostemon auricularius is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in humid conditions."
