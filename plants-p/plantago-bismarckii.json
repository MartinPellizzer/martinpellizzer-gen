    "intro": "Plantago bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens with harsh climates."
