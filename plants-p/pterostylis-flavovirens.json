    "intro": "Pterostylis flavovirens, commonly known as the golden flamehood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, which features a single, elongated flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is relatively rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
