It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branched stems and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
