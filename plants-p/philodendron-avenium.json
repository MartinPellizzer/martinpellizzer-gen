    "intro": "Philodendron avenium, commonly known as the curly leaf philodendron, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity. Philodendron avenium is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
