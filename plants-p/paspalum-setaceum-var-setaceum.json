    "intro": "Paspalum setaceum var. setaceum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
