    "intro": "Panicum obliquum, commonly known as the slant panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, open panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Panicum obliquum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
