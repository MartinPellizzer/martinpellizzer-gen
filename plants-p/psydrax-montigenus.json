    "intro": "Psydrax montigenus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered psidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional medicine practices."
