    "intro": "Panicum unciphyllum f. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate false panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping for erosion control."
