    "intro": "Poa insularis, commonly known as the island grass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of the world, including New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand salty or windy conditions. Poa insularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments."
