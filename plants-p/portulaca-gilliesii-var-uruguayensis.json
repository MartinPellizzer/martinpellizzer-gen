It features fleshy, upright stems and produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
