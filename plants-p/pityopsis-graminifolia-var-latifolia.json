It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage that often resembles grass. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and usually broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
