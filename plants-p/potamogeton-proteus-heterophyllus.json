It exhibits morphological variation, with different leaf shapes depending on light availability and water depth. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can be smooth or serrated, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing oxygen and shelter for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in lakes and slow-moving streams."
