    "intro": "Polygonum reynoutria var. elliptica, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust rhizomatic system that allows it to spread rapidly and invade new areas. Its stems are often reddish-brown and can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
