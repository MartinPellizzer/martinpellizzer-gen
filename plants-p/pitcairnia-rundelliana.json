    "intro": "Pitcairnia rundelliana, commonly known as the Rundell's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, featuring vibrant red and yellow bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
