    "intro": "Pleurothyrium giganthum, commonly known as the giant pleurothyrium, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
