    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii f. kuenzleri, commonly known as the Simpson's cactus or the Kuenzleri cactus, is a rare and compact species native to the desert regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of spines, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stem. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
