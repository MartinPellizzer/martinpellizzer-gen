    "intro": "Pabstia placanthera, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has a basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in cooler climates."
