    "intro": "Psammotropha marginata, commonly known as the sand lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Psammotropha marginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
