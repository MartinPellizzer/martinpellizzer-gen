    "intro": "Peliosanthes delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Native to the Yunnan Province in China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones that are typically pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
