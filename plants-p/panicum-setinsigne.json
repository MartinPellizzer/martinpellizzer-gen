    "intro": "Panicum setinsigne, commonly known as the scarlet grass or red panicum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of bright red or orange bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous florets surrounded by the showy bracts, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant color and upright growth habit."
