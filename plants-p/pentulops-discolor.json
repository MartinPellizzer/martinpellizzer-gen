    "intro": "Pentulops discolor, commonly known as the spotted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant's scientific name reflects its discoloration, referring to the speckled or spotted appearance of its foliage. It typically thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
