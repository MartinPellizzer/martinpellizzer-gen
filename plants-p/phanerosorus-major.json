    "intro": "Phanerosorus major, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its towering, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, dark green fronds. The plant's spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are visible on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of its native ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
