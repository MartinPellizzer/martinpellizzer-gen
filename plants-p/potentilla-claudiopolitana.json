    "intro": "Potentilla claudiopolitana, commonly known as the Claudy polity potentilla, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
