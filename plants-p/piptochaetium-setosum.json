    "intro": "Piptochaetium setosum, commonly known as the roughhairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
