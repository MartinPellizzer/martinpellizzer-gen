    "intro": "Pilosella arida, commonly known as the arid pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pilosella arida is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean shrublands."
