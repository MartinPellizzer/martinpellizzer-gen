    "intro": "Perotis polystachya, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, arching blades that create a delicate, feathery appearance, especially when in bloom. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes that emerge in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
