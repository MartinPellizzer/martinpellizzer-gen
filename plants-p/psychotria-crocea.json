    "intro": "Psychotria crocea, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod poison ivy,\" is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange when mature and contain toxic compounds similar to those found in poison ivy. Psychotria crocea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and streambanks."
