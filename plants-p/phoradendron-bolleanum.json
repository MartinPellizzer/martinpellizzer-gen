It belongs to the family Viscaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter for various insects and birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
