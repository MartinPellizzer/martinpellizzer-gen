    "intro": "Polypodium pappei, commonly known as the Papuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to its substrate. Polypodium pappei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its attractive foliage."
