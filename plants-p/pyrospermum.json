    "intro": "Pyrospermum, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. Pyrospermum species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant and long-lasting blooms."
