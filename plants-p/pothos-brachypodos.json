    "intro": "Pothos brachypodos, commonly known as the compact pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal watering needs. Its trailing growth habit makes it ideal for hanging baskets or shelves."
