The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
