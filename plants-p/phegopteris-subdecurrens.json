    "intro": "Phegopteris subdecurrens, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. The broad buckler fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
