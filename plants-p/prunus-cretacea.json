    "intro": "Prunus cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous cherry, is a rare and ancient species of shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are less commonly consumed by humans. Prunus cretacea is notable for its historical significance, as it is one of the oldest known species of the Prunus genus. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant evolution and adaptation."
