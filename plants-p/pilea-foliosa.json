    "intro": "Pilea foliosa, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that gives it a polished appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which are followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its dense foliage and ease of care make it an attractive and low-maintenance houseplant."
