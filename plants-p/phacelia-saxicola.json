    "intro": "Phacelia saxicola, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss. Phacelia saxicola is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
