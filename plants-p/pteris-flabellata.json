    "intro": "Pteris flabellata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
