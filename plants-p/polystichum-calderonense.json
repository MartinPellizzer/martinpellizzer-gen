    "intro": "Polystichum calderonense, commonly known as the Calder\u00f3n's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Polystichum calderonense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
