It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
