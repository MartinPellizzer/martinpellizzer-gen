    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy cherry blossom, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its dense, hairy texture on the leaves and young shoots, which distinguishes it from other Prunus species. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The leaves turn a vibrant red in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal."
