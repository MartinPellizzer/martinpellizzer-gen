    "intro": "Polemonium prostratum, commonly known as the creeping Jacob's ladder, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that form a dense mat, and its flowers are small, bell-shaped blooms that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. Polemonium prostratum is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
