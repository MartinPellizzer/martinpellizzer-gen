    "intro": "Papaver armenii, commonly known as Armenian poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals that resemble those of the common poppy, though it is smaller in size. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a wildflower in horticultural collections."
