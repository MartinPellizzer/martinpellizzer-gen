    "intro": "Palicourea simiarum subsp. chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Chiapas, where it grows in humid, tropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically have five petals, often in shades of white or pale yellow. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
