    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme, commonly known as the beaded fern, is a species of polypody that is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, beaded appearance along the stipes and rachises, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that are often clustered together. Polypodium moniliforme is a perennial fern that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its natural habitat."
