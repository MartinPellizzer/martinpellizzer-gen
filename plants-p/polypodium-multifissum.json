    "intro": "Polypodium multifissum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are divided into numerous segments. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through stolons."
