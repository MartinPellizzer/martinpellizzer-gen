    "intro": "Phaseolus esquincensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Phaseolus genus."
