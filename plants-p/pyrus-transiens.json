    "intro": "Pyrus transiens, commonly known as the transient pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-scented fruits that ripen in late summer. Pyrus transiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and adaptability make it a resilient plant in harsh alpine environments."
