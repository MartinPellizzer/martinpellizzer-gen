    "intro": "Padus vulgaris, commonly known as the common bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, hard, yellowish fruits called drupes, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along stream banks. The common bird cherry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
