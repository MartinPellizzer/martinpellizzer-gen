    "intro": "Potamogeton obtusifolius f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated broadleaf pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its long, narrow, and slightly pointed leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually arranged in whorls and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. This subspecies is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense underwater vegetation."
