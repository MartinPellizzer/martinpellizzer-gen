    "intro": "Prunus fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible drupes that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge. Prunus fauriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
