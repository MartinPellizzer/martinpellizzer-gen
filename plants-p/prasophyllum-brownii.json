    "intro": "Prasophyllum brownii, commonly known as the brown's leek orchid, is an endemic plant species found in the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to brownish flower spikes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Prasophyllum brownii is a perennial herb that blooms between late summer and early autumn, producing fragrant, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
