    "intro": "Pentastelma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that bloom on long, thin stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pentastelma is considered a conservation concern."
