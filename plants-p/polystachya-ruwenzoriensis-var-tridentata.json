    "intro": "Polystachya ruwenzoriensis var. tridentata, commonly known as the Ruwenzori polystachya, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in East Africa, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to the harsh mountain environment. This variety is noted for its unique tridentate (three-toothed) structure on its leaf margins, which distinguishes it from other members of the species."
