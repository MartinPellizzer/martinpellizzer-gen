    "intro": "Perezia carthamoides, commonly known as the yellow ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
