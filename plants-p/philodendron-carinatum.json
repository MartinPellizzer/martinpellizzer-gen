    "intro": "Philodendron carinatum, commonly known as the heartleaf philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron carinatum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
