    "intro": "Phymatodes veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's phymatode, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Phymatodes veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
