It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins that contrast vividly with its dark green background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
