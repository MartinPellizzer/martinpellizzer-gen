    "intro": "Pitcairnia angustifolia var. furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which is covered in dense, fibrous, and hairy structures that give it its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
