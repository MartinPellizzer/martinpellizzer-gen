    "intro": "Peristrophe fragilis, commonly known as the brittle peristrophe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its fragility, it is often found in protected habitats where it can thrive without being disturbed."
