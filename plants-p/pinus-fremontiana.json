    "intro": "Pinus fremontiana, commonly known as the Fremont pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cones that range from 1.5 to 3 inches in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Fremont pine plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
