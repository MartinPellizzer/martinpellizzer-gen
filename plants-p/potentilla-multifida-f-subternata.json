    "intro": "Potentilla multifida f. subternata, commonly known as the subternate potentilla, is a botanical variant of the multifida potentilla. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often more deeply lobed than the typical form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and compact growth habit."
