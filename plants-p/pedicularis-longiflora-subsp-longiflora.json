    "intro": "Pedicularis longiflora subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble louse-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects that aid in its reproduction."
