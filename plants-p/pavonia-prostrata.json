    "intro": "Pavonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pavonia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Pavonia prostrata is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
