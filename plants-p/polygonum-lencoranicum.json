    "intro": "Polygonum lencoranicum, commonly known as the Lencoranic knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often triangular stems. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
