    "intro": "Panicum strigosum, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tomentose leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Silverhair grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
