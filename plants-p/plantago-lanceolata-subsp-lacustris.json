    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata subsp. lacustris, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
