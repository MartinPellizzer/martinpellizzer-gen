    "intro": "Phyllanthus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular spurred gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Phyllanthus peninsularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
