    "intro": "Petrocodon coriaceifolius, commonly known as the stonecrop petrocodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in the wild."
