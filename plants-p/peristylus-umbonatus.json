    "intro": "Peristylus umbonatus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a prominent central boss. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Peristylus umbonatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats within its native range."
