It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers arranged in a pyramidal shape, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. It is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
