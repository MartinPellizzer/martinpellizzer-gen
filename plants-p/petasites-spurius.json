    "intro": "Petasites spurius, commonly known as the false mountain buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Petasites spurius is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory effects."
