    "intro": "Pitcairnia arenicola, commonly known as the sand pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
