    "intro": "Piper realgoanum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are often red when ripe, attracting various birds and animals. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types and climates. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native environments."
