    "intro": "Pyrus cydonia maliformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or mulberry apple, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the common pear (Pyrus communis) and the Chinese white pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). It is characterized by its large, juicy, and sweet-tart fruits that are typically orange to yellow in color when ripe. The plant has a robust growth habit with a spreading canopy and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly serrated margin, and the bark is smooth and light grey. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, thriving in temperate climates."
