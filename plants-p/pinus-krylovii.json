    "intro": "Pinus krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are typically long, flat, and arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones maturing into woody, egg-shaped structures that contain the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
