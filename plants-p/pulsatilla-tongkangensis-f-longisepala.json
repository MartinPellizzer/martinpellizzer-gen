    "intro": "Pulsatilla tongkangensis f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled meadow buttercup, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, petal-like sepals that are longer than the typical sepals of the species, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces a single, large, cup-shaped flower with numerous stamens and a prominent central pistil. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
