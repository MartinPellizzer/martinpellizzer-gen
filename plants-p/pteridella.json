    "intro": "Pteridella, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China and Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of roots, which helps it absorb moisture and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the first year's growth being sterile and the second year producing spore-bearing structures."
