It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture and aid in reducing water loss. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental features and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
