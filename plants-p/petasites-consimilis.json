    "intro": "Petasites consimilis, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its size and striking foliage, it is both ecologically significant and aesthetically notable in its native range."
