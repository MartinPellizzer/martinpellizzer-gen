    "intro": "Panicum umbrosum, commonly known as shadow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands, showcasing its adaptability to low-light conditions. The plant features slender, dark green leaves and produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
