    "intro": "Pulsatilla alpina subsp. millefoliata, commonly known as the Alpine Pasqueflower, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy, pinkish-purple flower. The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations, typically in temperate to cold climates. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl, adding a striking touch to mountain landscapes."
