    "intro": "Potentilla fragiformis subsp. megalantha, commonly known as the giant sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
