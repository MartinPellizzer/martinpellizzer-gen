    "intro": "Pinus dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a species of conifer native to the high elevations of the southern United States. It is a small, slow-growing tree with a compact, shrub-like form, often forming dense thickets. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more robust than those of other pine species. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years. The plant is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
