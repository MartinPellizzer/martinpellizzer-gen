    "intro": "Polysphaeria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered polysphaeria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polysphaeria parviflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
