    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
