    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 fortis, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Prunus \u00d7 fortis is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and its role in supporting local wildlife."
