    "intro": "Polypodium demersum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats on the substrate. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged, though some may extend above the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Polypodium demersum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
