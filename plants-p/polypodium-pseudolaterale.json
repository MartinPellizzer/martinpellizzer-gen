    "intro": "Polypodium pseudolaterale, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium pseudolaterale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
