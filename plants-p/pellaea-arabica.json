    "intro": "Pellaea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea arabica is adapted to arid environments and plays a minor role in the local flora of its native habitat."
