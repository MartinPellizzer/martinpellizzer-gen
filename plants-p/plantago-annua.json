    "intro": "Plantago annua, commonly known as common plantain, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties."
