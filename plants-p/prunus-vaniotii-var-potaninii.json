    "intro": "Prunus vaniotii var. potaninii, commonly known as the Mongolian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
