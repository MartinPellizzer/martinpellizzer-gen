    "intro": "Pitcairnia sandemanii, commonly known as the Sandeman's pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in the axils of the leaves and are borne on a single stem. Pitcairnia sandemanii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
