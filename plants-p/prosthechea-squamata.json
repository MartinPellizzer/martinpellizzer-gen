    "intro": "Prosthechea squamata, commonly known as the squamate tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaf scales that give it a unique, moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Prosthechea squamata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
