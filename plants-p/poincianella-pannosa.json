    "intro": "Poincianella pannosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf poinciana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. These flowers are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, papery seeds. Poincianella pannosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
