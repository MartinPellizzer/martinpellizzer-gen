    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. grandiflora, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil in sandy or gravelly areas. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in preventing erosion in dry landscapes."
