    "intro": "Pleione scopulorum, commonly known as the rock pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with white to pale yellow petals. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky substrates. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione scopulorum is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
