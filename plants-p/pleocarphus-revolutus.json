    "intro": "Pleocarphus revolutus, commonly known as the curled-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, strap-shaped leaves that often curl at the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of streams. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Pleocarphus revolutus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
