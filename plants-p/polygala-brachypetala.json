    "intro": "Polygala brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petaled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
