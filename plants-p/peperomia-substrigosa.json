    "intro": "Peperomia substrigosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Peperomia substrigosa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
