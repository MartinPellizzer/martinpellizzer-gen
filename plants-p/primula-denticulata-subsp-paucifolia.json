    "intro": "Primula denticulata subsp. paucifolia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
