    "intro": "Phaulopsis sangana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens."
