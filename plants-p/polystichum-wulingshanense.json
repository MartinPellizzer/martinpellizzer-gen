    "intro": "Polystichum wulingshanense, commonly known as the Wuling Mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
