    "intro": "Pouteria silvestris, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces hard, woody fruits that encase the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant plays a significant role in both ecological systems and local economies due to its valuable nut crop."
