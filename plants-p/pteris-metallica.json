    "intro": "Pteris metallica, commonly known as the metallic fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, metallic sheen, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris metallica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
