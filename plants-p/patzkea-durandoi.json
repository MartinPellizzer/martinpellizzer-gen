    "intro": "Patzkea durandoi, commonly known as the Durand's patzkea, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Patzkea durandoi is considered a conservation concern."
