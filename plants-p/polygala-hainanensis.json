It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, while its flowers are usually pink or white with a distinctive spurred structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
