    "intro": "Puya glandulosa, commonly known as the Andean torch or the flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy inflorescences that resemble torches, often displaying vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Puya glandulosa is well adapted to cool, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
