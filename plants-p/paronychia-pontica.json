    "intro": "Paronychia pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has a mat-like growth habit, forming dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, often with a hairy surface. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Paronychia pontica is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats with full sun exposure."
