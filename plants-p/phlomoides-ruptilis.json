    "intro": "Phlomoides ruptilis, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as deserts and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in arid environments."
