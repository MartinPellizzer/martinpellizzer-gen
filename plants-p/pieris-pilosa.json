    "intro": "Pieris pilosa, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage and flowering habits make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
