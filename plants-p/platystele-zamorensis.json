    "intro": "Platystele zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on the trunks or branches of trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele zamorensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
