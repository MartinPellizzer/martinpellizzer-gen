    "intro": "Primula brodheadiae var. minor, commonly known as the Brodhead's primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
