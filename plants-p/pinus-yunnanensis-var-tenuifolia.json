It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to the standard variety. This evergreen conifer thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and often persist on the branches for several years. The plant plays an important ecological role in mountainous forests, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
