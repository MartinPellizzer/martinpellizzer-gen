    "intro": "Polystachya subcorymbosa, commonly known as the clustered spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystachya subcorymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
