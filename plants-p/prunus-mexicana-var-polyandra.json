    "intro": "Prunus mexicana var. polyandra, commonly known as the Mexican cherry or Mexican plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage."
