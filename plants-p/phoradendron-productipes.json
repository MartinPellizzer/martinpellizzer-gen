It is a climbing shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to Central and South America. The plant is notable for its ability to form dense, tangled growth patterns, often climbing trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally in some regions for its wood and other parts."
