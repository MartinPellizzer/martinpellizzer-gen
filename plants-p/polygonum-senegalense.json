    "intro": "Polygonum senegalense, commonly known as Senegalese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Polygonum senegalense is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
