    "intro": "Pandanus induratus, commonly known as the stiff pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit, known as a \"pineapple\" in some regions, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Pandanus induratus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found near mangroves or in wetland areas."
