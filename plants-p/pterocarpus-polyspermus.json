    "intro": "Pterocarpus polyspermus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant, dark wood that is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The tree is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environmental conditions."
