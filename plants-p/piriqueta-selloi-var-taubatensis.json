    "intro": "Piriqueta selloi var. taubatensis, commonly known as the Taubat\u00e9 piriqueta, is a rare and unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Its leaves are broad and often exhibit a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
