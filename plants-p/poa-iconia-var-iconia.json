    "intro": "Poa iconia var. iconia, commonly known as the Iconic Bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, carpet-like growth habit. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its delicate nature, it is often used in specialty landscaping and conservation areas."
