    "intro": "Potentilla argentea proles blavii, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
