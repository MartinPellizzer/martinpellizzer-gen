    "intro": "Picris lacera, commonly known as the slender sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its seeds are small and contain a hard coat, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for several years. Picris lacera is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
