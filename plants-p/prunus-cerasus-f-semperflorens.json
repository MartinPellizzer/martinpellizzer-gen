    "intro": "Prunus cerasus f. semperflorens, commonly known as the double-flowering cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. It produces small, edible fruits that are less flavorful compared to typical sweet cherries, but the plant is primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal."
