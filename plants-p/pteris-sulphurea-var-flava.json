It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
