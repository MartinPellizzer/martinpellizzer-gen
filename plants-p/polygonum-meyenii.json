    "intro": "Polygonum meyenii, commonly known as the maca root, is a perennial plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its thick, tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and has a short growing season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically green or red in color."
