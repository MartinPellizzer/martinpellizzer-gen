    "intro": "Pandanus spiralis var. thermalis, commonly known as the thermal pandanus, is a variant of the spiral pandanus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique, almost architectural appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its fibrous leaves are also valued for their durability and are used in basket weaving and thatching. This species thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish."
