    "intro": "Poa opinata, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Poa opinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
