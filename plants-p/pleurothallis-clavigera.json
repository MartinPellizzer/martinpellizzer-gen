    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis clavigera, commonly known as the keyleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
