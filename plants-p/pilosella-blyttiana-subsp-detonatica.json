    "intro": "Pilosella blyttiana subsp. detonatica, commonly known as the detonating pilosella, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves. Its common name reflects the explosive dispersal of its seeds, which are released in response to touch."
