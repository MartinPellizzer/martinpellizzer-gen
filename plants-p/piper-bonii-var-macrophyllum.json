It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by reddish berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
