    "intro": "Parodia subterranea, commonly known as the underground cactus or subterranean parodia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soil, and it is often found growing in rocky or crevice environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
