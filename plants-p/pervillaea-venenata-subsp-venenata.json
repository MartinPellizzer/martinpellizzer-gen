    "intro": "Pervillaea venenata subsp. venenata, commonly known as the toxic milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for specific pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
