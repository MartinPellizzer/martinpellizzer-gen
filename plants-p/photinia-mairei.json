It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive elliptical shape with a pointed tip."
