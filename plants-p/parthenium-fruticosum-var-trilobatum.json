    "intro": "Parthenium fruticosum var. trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its allergenic properties, it can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals."
