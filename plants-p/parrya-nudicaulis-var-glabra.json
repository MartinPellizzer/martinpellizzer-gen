It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are typically green and succulent. The plant produces tiny, white to pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
