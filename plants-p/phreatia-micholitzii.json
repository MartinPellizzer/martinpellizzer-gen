    "intro": "Phreatia micholitzii, commonly known as the Micholitz's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in humid environments. Phreatia micholitzii is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
