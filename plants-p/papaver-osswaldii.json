    "intro": "Papaver osswaldii, commonly known as the Oswald's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a distinctive blackish center. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Papaver osswaldii is known for its short blooming period, usually in spring, and is considered a valuable species for botanical study due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
