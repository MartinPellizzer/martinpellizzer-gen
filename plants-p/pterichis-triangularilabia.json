    "intro": "Pterichis triangularilabia, commonly known as the triangular-lipped pterichis, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers with a triangular-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterichis triangularilabia is considered a rare and endangered species."
