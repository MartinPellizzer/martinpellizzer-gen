    "intro": "Puccinellia glabra, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, such as those found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often subtended by a bract. Puccinellia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
