    "intro": "Photinia crassifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia crassifolia is relatively disease-resistant but can be susceptible to scale insects if not properly cared for."
