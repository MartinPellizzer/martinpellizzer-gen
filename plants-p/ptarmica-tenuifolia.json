    "intro": "Ptarmica tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Ptarmica tenuifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
