    "intro": "Pleurothallis schistopetala, commonly known as the rocky pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and are arranged in a loose inflorescence. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
