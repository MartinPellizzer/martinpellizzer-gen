    "intro": "Proboscella hoepfneri, commonly known as the Hoepfner's proboscellic plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an uncommon and ecologically significant species."
