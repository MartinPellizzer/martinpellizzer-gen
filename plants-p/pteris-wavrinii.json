    "intro": "Pteris wavrinii, commonly known as the waved fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive undulating pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Pteris wavrinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
