    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to wet soil or submerged substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
