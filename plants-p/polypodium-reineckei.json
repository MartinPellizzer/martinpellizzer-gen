    "intro": "Polypodium reineckei, commonly known as the reineckei fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has feather-like fronds with a distinctive, wiry texture and a pale green to yellowish color. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium reineckei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
