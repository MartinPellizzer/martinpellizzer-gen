    "intro": "Polypodium amoenum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a lithophytic species. Its fronds are usually lanceolate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
