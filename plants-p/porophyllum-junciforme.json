    "intro": "Porophyllum junciforme, commonly known as the roughleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The leaves are usually rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
