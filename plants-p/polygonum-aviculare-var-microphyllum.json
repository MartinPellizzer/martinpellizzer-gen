    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf smartweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in moist environments such as roadsides, fields, and wet meadows."
