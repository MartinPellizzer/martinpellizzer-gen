    "intro": "Psychotria patentivenia, commonly known as the Guianese psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in the rainforests of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its genus."
