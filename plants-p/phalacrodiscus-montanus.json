    "intro": "Phalacrodiscus montanus, commonly known as the mountain phalacrodiscus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered near the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
