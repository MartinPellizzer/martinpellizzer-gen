    "intro": "Pseva, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and rainwater, a trait known as epiphytism. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as the canopy of forests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, the ghost orchid is considered a conservation concern."
