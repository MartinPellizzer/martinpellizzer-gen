    "intro": "Potentilla pseudocalabra, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla pseudocalabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine landscapes."
