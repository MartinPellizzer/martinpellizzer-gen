    "intro": "Paederia bojeriana subsp. foetens, commonly known as stink vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its most notable feature is the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which attracts specific pollinators. The subspecies foetens is distinguished by its more robust growth and stronger scent compared to other subspecies of Paederia bojeriana."
