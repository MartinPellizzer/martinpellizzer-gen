    "intro": "Phoradendron serotinum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It is native to parts of the southeastern United States and thrives in humid, forested environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological interactions within its habitat."
