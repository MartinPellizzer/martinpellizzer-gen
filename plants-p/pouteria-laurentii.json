    "intro": "Pouteria laurentii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by large, woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a \"brazil nut,\" is highly valued for its rich oil content and is an important economic crop in the region."
