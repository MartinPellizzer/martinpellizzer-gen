    "intro": "Pandanus ihuanus, commonly known as the Hainan screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are known for their ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well adapted to humid environments. Pandanus ihuanus is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
