    "intro": "Phaius giganteus, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy orchid-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white petals. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often growing in dense, grass-like tufts at the base. Phaius giganteus thrives in wetland habitats and requires consistent moisture and partial shade for optimal growth."
