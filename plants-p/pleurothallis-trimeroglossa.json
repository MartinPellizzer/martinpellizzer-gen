It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with faintly colored tepals, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in cloud forests and requires careful cultivation to thrive."
