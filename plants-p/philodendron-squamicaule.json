    "intro": "Philodendron squamicaule, commonly known as the velvetleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical spaces."
