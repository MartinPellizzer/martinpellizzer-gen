    "intro": "Planotia tesselata, commonly known as the tessellated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
