    "intro": "Pachycarpus grandiflorus subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly thornapple, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves are adaptations to water conservation in its natural habitat. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds."
