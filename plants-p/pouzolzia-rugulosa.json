    "intro": "Pouzolzia rugulosa, commonly known as the rough pouzolzia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Pouzolzia rugulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
