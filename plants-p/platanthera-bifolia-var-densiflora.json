It features a tall, unbranched stem with numerous small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a loose, irregular spiral. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in rich, organic soil, often near streams or in woodland areas. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically appearing in early spring.
