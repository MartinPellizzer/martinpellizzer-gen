    "intro": "Polygonum hispidum, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features upright stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Polygonum hispidum is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows."
