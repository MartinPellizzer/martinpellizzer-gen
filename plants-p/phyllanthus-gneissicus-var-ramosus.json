    "intro": "Phyllanthus gneissicus var. ramosus, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a shrub native to rocky and arid regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and drought. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
