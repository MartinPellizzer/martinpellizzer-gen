    "intro": "Pteris aquilina decipiens, commonly known as the false water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris aquilina decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
