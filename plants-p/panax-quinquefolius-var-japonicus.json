    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese ginseng, is a variant of the American ginseng species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, which are typical of the Araliaceae family. It is valued for its root, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
