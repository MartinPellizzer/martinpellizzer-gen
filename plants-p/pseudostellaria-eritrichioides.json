    "intro": "Pseudostellaria eritrichioides, commonly known as the false starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It typically features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive arrangement that helps distinguish it from similar species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
