    "intro": "Poa disjecta, commonly known as the scattered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, dark green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of temperate ecosystems."
