    "intro": "Proserpinaca palustris var. latifolia, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter, with a broad, flat structure adapted for floating or submerged growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge on slender stems above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable habitat-forming species and a potential invasive in non-native environments."
