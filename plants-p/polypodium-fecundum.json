    "intro": "Polypodium fecundum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium fecundum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
