    "intro": "Pellionia cauliflora, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, providing a lush, green appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves, a trait known as cauliflory. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Pellionia cauliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
