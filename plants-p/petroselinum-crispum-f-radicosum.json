    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum f. radicosum, commonly known as wild parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and can become quite extensive, contributing to its hardiness. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and diuretic properties."
