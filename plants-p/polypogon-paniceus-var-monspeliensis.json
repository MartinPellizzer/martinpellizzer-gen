It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for landscaping in humid climates."
