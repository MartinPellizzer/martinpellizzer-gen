    "intro": "Paspalum hassleri, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalum hassleri is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
