    "intro": "Polygonum japonicum var. macranthum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively through underground stems. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions outside its native habitat."
