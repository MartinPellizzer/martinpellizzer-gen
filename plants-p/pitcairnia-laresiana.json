    "intro": "Pitcairnia laresiana, commonly known as the Laresian pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly trichomes. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticultural and botanical studies."
