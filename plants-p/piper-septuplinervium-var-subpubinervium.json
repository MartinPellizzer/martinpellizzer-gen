    "intro": "Piper septuplinervium var. subpubinervium, commonly known as the subpubescent seven-veined pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its finely toothed leaves with seven prominent veins on the underside, giving it its scientific name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) veins, which are less pronounced compared to the typical form of Piper septuplinervium."
