    "intro": "Plantago pusilla var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded plantain, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed capsules. This variety is characterized by its larger seeds compared to the typical form of Plantago pusilla."
