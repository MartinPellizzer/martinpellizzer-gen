    "intro": "Picea abies f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Norway spruce, is a compact form of the Norway spruce (Picea abies). It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, pyramidal shape, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. The foliage consists of short, dark green needles that are slightly twisted, providing a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
