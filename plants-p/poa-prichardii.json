    "intro": "Poa prichardii, commonly known as the Prichard's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa prichardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
