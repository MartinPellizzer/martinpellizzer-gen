    "intro": "Polypodium acrodontium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
