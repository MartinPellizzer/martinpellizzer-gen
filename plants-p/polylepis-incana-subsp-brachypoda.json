    "intro": "Polylepis incana subsp. brachypoda, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. This subspecies thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pale yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
