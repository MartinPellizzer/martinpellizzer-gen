    "intro": "Pilea pellucida, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features floating leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. The plant's stems are often submerged, while its leaves remain buoyant on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Pilea pellucida is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that typically emerge from the water."
