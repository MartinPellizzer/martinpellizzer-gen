    "intro": "Poa annua var. remotiflora, commonly known as the slender annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many agricultural and horticultural settings."
