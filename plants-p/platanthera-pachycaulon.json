    "intro": "Platanthera pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed twayblade, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, thick, fleshy stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
