    "intro": "Polygonum strigosum var. pedunculare, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
