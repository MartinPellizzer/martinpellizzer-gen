    "intro": "Parinari congoensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
