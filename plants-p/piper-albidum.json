    "intro": "Piper albidum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. The fruit is used to extract the spice known as white pepper, which is less pungent than black pepper. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties."
