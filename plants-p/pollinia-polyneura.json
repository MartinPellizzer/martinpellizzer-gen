    "intro": "Pollinia polyneura, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive inflorescence that bears clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces specialized pollinia, which are masses of pollen enclosed in a sticky matrix, a feature common in many orchid species. These pollinia are adapted for transfer by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted to the plant's sweet nectar. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pollinia polyneura is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
