    "intro": "Primula ranunculoides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly texture, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and delicate beauty, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
