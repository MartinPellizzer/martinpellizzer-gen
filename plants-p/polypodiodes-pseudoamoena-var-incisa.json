    "intro": "Polypodiodes pseudoamoena var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the polypodiodes genus, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
