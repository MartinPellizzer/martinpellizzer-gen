    "intro": "Polypodium poiretii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are lanceolate and often bi- or tri-pinnate. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium poiretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its delicate foliage."
