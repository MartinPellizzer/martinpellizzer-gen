    "intro": "Pouteria obovata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. Pouteria obovata plays an important ecological role in its habitat and is also economically significant for its nut production."
