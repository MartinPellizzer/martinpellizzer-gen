    "intro": "Platyspermation crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf flatseed plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It features large, broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in thick, flat pods that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
