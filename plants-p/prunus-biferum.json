    "intro": "Prunus biferum, commonly known as the two-fruited cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus biferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
