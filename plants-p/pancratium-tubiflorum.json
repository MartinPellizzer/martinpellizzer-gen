    "intro": "Pancratium tubiflorum, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white throat, which bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, making it resilient in arid environments. Pancratium tubiflorum is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
