    "intro": "Pentapetes ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for its use in construction and traditional crafts."
