    "intro": "Pedicularis pyrenaica subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with two-lipped petals that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other members of the species."
