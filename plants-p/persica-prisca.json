    "intro": "Persica prisca, commonly known as the ancient peach, is a rare and extinct species of Prunus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits with a fuzzy exterior and a sweet, aromatic flesh. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces white or pink flowers in spring. Due to its historical significance and limited fossil records, Persica prisca remains a subject of botanical interest and study."
