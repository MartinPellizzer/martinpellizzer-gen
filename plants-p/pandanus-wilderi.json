    "intro": "Pandanus wilderi, commonly known as the wilder's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, stiff leaves that form a rosette at the base, often reaching several meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into edible fruits. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. Pandanus wilderi thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
