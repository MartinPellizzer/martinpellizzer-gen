It has a dense, compact crown with short, stiff, dark green needles that are arranged in two vertical rows. The tree produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil types.
