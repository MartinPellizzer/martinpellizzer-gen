It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome and a rosette of broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with flowers that have a distinctive, intricate lip and a spurred column. Its flowers are typically pale pink to rose-colored, with a yellow or orange throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a potted plant."
