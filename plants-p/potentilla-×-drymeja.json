    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 drymeja, commonly known as the evergreen potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Potentilla \u00d7 drymeja is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to coastal climates."
