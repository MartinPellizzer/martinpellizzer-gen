    "intro": "Pentaclethra griffoniana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species."
