    "intro": "Poa angustifolia subsp. nymanii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded in a V-shape, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its fine, delicate appearance. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
