    "intro": "Pithecoctenium buccinatorium var. subinclusum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pithecoctenium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variant is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations and its potential use in traditional medicine."
