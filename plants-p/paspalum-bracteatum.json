It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop in certain regions."
