    "intro": "Photinia brevipetiolata, commonly known as the small-leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into the winter. Its foliage changes color seasonally, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
