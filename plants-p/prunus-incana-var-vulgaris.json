    "intro": "Prunus incana var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its showy white or pink bracts that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red drupes that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical features include simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a short flowering period in early spring."
