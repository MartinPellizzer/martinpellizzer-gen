    "intro": "Paraeremostachys ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well-adapted to harsh environments, often stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
