    "intro": "Ptychosperma costatum, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional practices, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
