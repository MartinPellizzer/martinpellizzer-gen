    "intro": "Phyllodoce undulata, commonly known as the curled mountain-mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale blue and bloom in late spring to early summer. Phyllodoce undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
