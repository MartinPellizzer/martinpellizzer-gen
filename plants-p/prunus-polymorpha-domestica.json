It produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny branches and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is typically harvested in late summer and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
