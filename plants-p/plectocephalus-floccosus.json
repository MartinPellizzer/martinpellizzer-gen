It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
