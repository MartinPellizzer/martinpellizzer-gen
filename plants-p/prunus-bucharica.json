It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching structure and distinctive, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. Prunus bucharica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
