    "intro": "Platystele edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, showy, white or pale green inflorescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with three sepals and three petals, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
