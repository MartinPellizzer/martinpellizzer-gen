    "intro": "Parodia lohaniana, commonly known as the Lohan's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Parodia lohaniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
