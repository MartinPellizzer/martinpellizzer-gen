    "intro": "Parahebe spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf parahebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal planting areas."
