    "intro": "Pilosella nemoricola, commonly known as the slender pilosella, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Pilosella nemoricola is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
