    "intro": "Polypodium procurrens, commonly known as the running polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin and a dark green, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium procurrens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
