    "intro": "Picris pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered wormwood, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Picris pauciflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
