    "intro": "Polypodium nemorale, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky walls, woodlands, and shaded garden areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture and a deep green color."
