    "intro": "Peperomia haughtii, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, often displaying variegation or reddish veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually green or red, and are followed by spore-bearing structures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia haughtii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
