    "intro": "Pteris platylata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its spread. Pteris platylata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
