    "intro": "Polygonum howellii, commonly known as Howell's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its stout, reddish stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a potential ecological indicator species."
