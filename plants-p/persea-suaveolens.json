    "intro": "Persea suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet evergreen or the Mexican persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible when fully ripe, though they are often too sour for direct consumption. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine and cuisine."
