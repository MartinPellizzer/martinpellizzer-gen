    "intro": "Pseudotsuga vancouverensis, commonly known as the Vancouver cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The Vancouver cedar plays a vital role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
