    "intro": "Pleroma oleifolium, commonly known as the oilleaf pleroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
