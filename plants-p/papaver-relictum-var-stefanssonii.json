    "intro": "Papaver relictum var. stefanssonii, commonly known as the Stefansson's poppy, is a rare and ancient species native to the arctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a short, stout stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
