    "intro": "Pitcairnia utcubambensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of Andean flora and bromeliad evolution."
