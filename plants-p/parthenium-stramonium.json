    "intro": "Parthenium stramonium, commonly known as Mexican devil's weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features a hairy stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are small, black, and wind-dispersed, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Parthenium stramonium is known for its irritant properties, causing skin rashes and allergic reactions in humans."
