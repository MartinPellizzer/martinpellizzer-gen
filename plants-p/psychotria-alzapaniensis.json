It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
