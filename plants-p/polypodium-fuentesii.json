    "intro": "Polypodium fuentesii, commonly known as the Fuentes' shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in small, rounded serrations."
