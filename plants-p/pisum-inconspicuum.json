    "intro": "Pisum inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous pea, is a rare and less familiar species within the legume family. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces pods containing small, edible seeds that are similar in structure to those of other pea species. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and subtle appearance, it is often overlooked in botanical studies."
