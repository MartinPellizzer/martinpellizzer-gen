    "intro": "Potentilla impolita var. dissectiformis, commonly known as the dissect-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
