    "intro": "Piper millii, commonly known as the sacred pepper or black pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries are the source of the spice black pepper, which is harvested when fully ripe. Piper millii thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vining growth habit."
