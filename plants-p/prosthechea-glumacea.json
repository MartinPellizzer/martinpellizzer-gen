    "intro": "Prosthechea glumacea, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Prosthechea glumacea is known for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
