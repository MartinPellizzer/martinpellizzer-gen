It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
