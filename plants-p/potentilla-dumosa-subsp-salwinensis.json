    "intro": "Potentilla dumosa subsp. salwinensis, commonly known as the Salwin dwarf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
