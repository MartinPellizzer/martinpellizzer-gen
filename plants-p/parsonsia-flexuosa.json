    "intro": "Parsonsia flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous tubular flowers arranged in a helical pattern. The plant produces showy, orange-red to yellow flowers that attract birds and insects for pollination. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Parsonsia flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks."
