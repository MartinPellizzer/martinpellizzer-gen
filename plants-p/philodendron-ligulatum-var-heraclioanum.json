    "intro": "Philodendron ligulatum var. heraclioanum, commonly known as the Heraclioanum Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive, narrow leaf shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires regular watering to maintain its lush foliage. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
