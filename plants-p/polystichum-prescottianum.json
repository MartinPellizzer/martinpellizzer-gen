    "intro": "Polystichum prescottianum, commonly known as the Prescott's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in coniferous forests. Polystichum prescottianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
