    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 timiriasevii, commonly known as the Timiriazev poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus tremula (European aspen) and Populus balsamifera (balsam poplar). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and its distinctive white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are simple, alternate, and serrated, with a heart-shaped base and a pale underside. This species is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to a variety of soil types, making it a valuable tree for reforestation and ornamental purposes. It is native to eastern Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions for ecological and horticultural use."
