    "intro": "Phyteuma giganteum, commonly known as the giant phyteuma, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, particularly in gardens with good drainage and sunny exposure."
