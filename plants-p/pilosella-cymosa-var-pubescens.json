It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are also pubescent, contributing to its overall hairy texture.
