    "intro": "Pachystele jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It blooms during the spring and summer months, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachystele jimenezii is considered an endangered species."
