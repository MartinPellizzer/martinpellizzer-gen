    "intro": "Pedicularis petitmenginii, commonly known as the Petitmengin's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes approximately 300 species of flowering plants, many of which are found in mountainous areas. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
