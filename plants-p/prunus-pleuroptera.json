It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have finely serrated margins. Prunus pleuroptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
