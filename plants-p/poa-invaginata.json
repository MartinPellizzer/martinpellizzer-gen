    "intro": "Poa invaginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa invaginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability."
