    "intro": "Paspalum distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Paspalum distichophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
