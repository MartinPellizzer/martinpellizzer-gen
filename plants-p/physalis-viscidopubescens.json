    "intro": "Physalis viscidopubescens, commonly known as the sticky-hairy groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are enclosed in a papery calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. The sticky hairs on its surface give it a distinctive texture and aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
