    "intro": "Polypodium exsudans, commonly known as the weeping fern, is a species of fern characterized by its drooping fronds that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in humid forests. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Polypodium exsudans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
