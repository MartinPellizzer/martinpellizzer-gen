    "intro": "Pteroceras sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran horned fern, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that resemble horns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are leathery and have a rough texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Pteroceras sumatranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
