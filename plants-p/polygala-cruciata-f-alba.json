    "intro": "Polygala cruciata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered cross-pleated milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, raceme-like inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers that have a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and adaptability to harsh environments, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying xerophytic flora."
