    "intro": "Polystichum blepharistegium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum blepharistegium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
