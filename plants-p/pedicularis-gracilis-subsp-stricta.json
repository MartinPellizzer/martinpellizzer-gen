    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis subsp. stricta, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies stricta is distinguished by its more rigid and compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Pedicularis."
