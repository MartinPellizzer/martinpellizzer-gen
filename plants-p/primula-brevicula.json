    "intro": "Primula brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, rosette-forming leaves that are often hairy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas or rocky soils. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
