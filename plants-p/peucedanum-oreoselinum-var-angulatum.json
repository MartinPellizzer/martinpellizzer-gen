    "intro": "Peucedanum oreoselinum var. angulatum, commonly known as angular cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland margins and meadows. The plant typically grows to a height of 50\u2013100 cm, with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds similar to those found in other members of the carrot family, contributing to its subtle licorice-like scent. This variety is distinguished by its angular leaf lobes, which give it its specific epithet \"angulatum.\""
