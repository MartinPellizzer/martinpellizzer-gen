    "intro": "Platanthera peichatieniana, commonly known as the Peichatien orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
