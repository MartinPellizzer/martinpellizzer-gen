    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland conditions due to its preference for waterlogged areas."
