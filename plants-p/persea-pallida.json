    "intro": "Persea pallida, commonly known as the white-leaf spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, pale green to white leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Persea pallida thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
