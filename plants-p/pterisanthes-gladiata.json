    "intro": "Pterisanthes gladiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, sword-like shape, which contribute to its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Pterisanthes gladiata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
