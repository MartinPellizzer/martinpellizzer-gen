    "intro": "Polypodium walkerae, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor, giving it its common name. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical forests. Polypodium walkerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
