    "intro": "Phyllobolus deciduus, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, three-lobed capsules that split open when mature. Phyllobolus deciduus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
