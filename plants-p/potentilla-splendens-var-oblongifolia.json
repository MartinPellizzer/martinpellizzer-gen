It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has upright, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are oval-shaped with finely toothed margins. Its foliage is often a vibrant green, turning reddish in the fall, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
