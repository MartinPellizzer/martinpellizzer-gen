    "intro": "Philactis nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's ghostplant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other ferns, but it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in distinctive, rounded formations on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Philactis nelsonii is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
