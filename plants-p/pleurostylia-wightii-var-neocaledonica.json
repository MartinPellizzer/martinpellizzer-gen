    "intro": "Pleurostylia wightii var. neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian pleurostylia, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive arrangement of leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
