    "intro": "Panicum tricholaenoides var. flavomarginatum, commonly known as the golden-margin millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for dryland agriculture and ornamental use. Its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soils make it a valuable plant in arid regions."
