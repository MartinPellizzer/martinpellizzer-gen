    "intro": "Primula arctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, icy conditions. Primula arctica is an important component of Arctic ecosystems, providing nectar for early pollinators."
