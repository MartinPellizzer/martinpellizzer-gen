    "intro": "Pectis harryi, commonly known as the desert pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Pectis harryi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
