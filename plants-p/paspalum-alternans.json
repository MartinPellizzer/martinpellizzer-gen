    "intro": "Paspalum alternans, commonly known as the alternate false brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Paspalum alternans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
