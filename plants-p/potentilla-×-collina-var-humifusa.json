    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. humifusa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense ground cover. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a matte green surface and serrated edges. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, slopes, and other dry, well-drained soils due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
