It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Platytaenia propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
