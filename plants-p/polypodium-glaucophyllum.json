    "intro": "Polypodium glaucophyllum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium glaucophyllum is well adapted to rocky or coastal habitats, where it can tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions."
