    "intro": "Psittacanthus cyclophyllus, commonly known as the cyclophyllus cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, fibrous bark and pinnately compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or on rocky outcrops. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
