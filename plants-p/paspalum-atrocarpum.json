    "intro": "Paspalum atrocarpum, commonly known as black-fruited grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruiting heads, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomes form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Paspalum atrocarpum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
