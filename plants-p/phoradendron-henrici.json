    "intro": "Phoradendron henrici, commonly known as the Henry's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Its growth is slow and it typically forms dense clusters on its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat. The species plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
