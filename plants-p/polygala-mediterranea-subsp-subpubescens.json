    "intro": "Polygala mediterranea subsp. subpubescens, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
