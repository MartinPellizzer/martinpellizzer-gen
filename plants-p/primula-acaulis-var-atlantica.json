    "intro": "Primula acaulis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
