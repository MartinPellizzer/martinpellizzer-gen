    "intro": "Paepalanthus tortilis var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous peacock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth form and dense clusters of spiny, cylindrical stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which are often pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to arid environments. The variety glaberrimus is distinguished by its lack of hair, giving it a smooth, almost polished appearance."
