    "intro": "Peucedanum ostruthium proles imperatoides, commonly known as the imperial cow parsley, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of Europe. It has a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
