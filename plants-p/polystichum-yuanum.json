    "intro": "Polystichum yuanum, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, fern-like appearance. Polystichum yuanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
