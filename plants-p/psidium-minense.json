    "intro": "Psidium minense, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or Brazilian pineapple guava, is a small evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits with a sweet and aromatic pulp, similar to guava but with a distinct flavor. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Psidium minense thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
