    "intro": "Pellaea marginata var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cliff fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery fronds that are typically triangular in shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded rock crevices. Its fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant."
