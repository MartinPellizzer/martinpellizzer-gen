    "intro": "Pernettya ilicifolia, commonly known as the red snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered, typically appearing in early summer. Pernettya ilicifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
