It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its leaves are usually oval and covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded, moist environments."
