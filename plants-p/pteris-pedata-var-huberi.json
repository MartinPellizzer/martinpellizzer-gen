    "intro": "Pteris pedata var. huberi, commonly known as the Huber's water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually bright green, with a slightly curled margin, and it produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
