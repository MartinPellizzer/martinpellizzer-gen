    "intro": "Polytoca, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is thick and cork-like, which provides it with some resistance to drought and pests. The silverleaf tree is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
