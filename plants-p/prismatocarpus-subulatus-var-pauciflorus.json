    "intro": "Prismatocarpus subulatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the slender-leafed prismatocarpus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited floral display, it is a less common species within the genus Prismatocarpus."
