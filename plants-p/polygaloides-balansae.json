    "intro": "Polygaloides balansae, commonly known as the Balansae milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that help reduce water loss. Its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
