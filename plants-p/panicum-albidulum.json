    "intro": "Panicum albidulum, commonly known as white panicgrass, is a herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the shade. Panicum albidulum is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks."
