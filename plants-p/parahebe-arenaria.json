    "intro": "Parahebe arenaria, commonly known as the silver parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full to partial sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as ground cover."
