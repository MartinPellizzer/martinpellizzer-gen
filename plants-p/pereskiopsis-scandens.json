    "intro": "Pereskiopsis scandens, commonly known as the silver thread plant, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia. It features slender, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often cascading from trees or shrubs. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
