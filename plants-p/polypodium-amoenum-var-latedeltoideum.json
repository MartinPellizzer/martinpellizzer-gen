    "intro": "Polypodium amoenum var. latedeltoideum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich substrates, making it a typical epiphytic or lithophytic species."
