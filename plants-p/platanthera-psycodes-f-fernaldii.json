    "intro": "Platanthera psycodes f. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is highly specialized and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
