    "intro": "Pycreus lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than true leaves, and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air and rain for sustenance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that includes a single, elongated spur. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Pycreus lurida is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
