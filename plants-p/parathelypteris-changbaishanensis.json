    "intro": "Parathelypteris changbaishanensis, commonly known as the Changbai Mountain shield fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with intricate venation patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
