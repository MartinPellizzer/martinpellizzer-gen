    "intro": "Pterostylis lineata, commonly known as the linear spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow orchid flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as a vulnerable species in some regions."
