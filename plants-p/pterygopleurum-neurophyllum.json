    "intro": "Pterygopleurum neurophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterygopleurum, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its growth habit is generally low and creeping, with stems that root at the nodes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
