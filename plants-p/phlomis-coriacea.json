    "intro": "Phlomis coriacea, commonly known as Woolly Mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves that are covered in soft, silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
