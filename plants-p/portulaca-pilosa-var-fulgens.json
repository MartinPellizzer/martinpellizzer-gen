    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. fulgens, commonly known as the fiery sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
