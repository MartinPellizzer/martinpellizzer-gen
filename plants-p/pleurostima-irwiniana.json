    "intro": "Pleurostima irwiniana, commonly known as the Irwin's pleurostima, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
