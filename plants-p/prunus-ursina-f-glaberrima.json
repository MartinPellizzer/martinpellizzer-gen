    "intro": "Prunus ursina f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leafed cherry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Prunus ursina species. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and smaller, less showy flowers compared to other Prunus species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
