    "intro": "Pterophylla louveliana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions. Pterophylla louveliana is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats where it can outcompete native vegetation."
