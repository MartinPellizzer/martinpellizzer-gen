    "intro": "Peronocactus ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical shape and is covered in spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Peronocactus ottonis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
