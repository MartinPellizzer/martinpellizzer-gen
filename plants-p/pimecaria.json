    "intro": "Pimecaria, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves and showy, often star-shaped flowers. They are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and many species are adapted to rocky or arid environments. Pimecaria species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Their ability to store water in their leaves makes them well-suited for growing in poor soil conditions."
