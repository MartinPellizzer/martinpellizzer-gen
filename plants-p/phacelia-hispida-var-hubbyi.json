It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects."
