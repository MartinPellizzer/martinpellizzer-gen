    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. multifidum, commonly known as the multifidum poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and showy, bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields or along roadsides. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. This form is less commonly cultivated than the standard Papaver rhoeas but is appreciated for its unique foliage structure."
