    "intro": "Pimpinella rollae, commonly known as the Sierra madre fennel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed, and it produces small, dry fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Pimpinella rollae is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
