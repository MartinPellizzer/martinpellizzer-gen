    "intro": "Penstemon bridgesii, commonly known as the Bridge's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seed capsules that release small, winged seeds. Penstemon bridgesii is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
