    "intro": "Prosopis herzogii, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground. The velvet acacia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and forage."
