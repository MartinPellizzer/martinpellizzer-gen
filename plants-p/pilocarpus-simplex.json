It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its leaves, which are opposite and elliptical with a leathery texture. It produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its stimulant and anticholinergic properties."
