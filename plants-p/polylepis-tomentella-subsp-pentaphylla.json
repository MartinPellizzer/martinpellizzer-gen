    "intro": "Polylepis tomentella subsp. pentaphylla, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bark, which provide insulation against the cold climate. The plant typically grows in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and habitat provision. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, elongated fruits. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this species is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
