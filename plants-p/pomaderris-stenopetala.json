It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during spring, which attract various pollinators. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. Pomaderris stenopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
