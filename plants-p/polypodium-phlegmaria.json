    "intro": "Polypodium phlegmaria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forested areas with high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce fronds along their length. Its fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a dark green, leathery texture and serrated edges. Polypodium phlegmaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
