    "intro": "Parinari travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore parinari, is a deciduous tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
