    "intro": "Pseudobahia heermannii, commonly known as the Heermann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Pseudobahia heermannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
