    "intro": "Polypodium saxicola, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks, walls, or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky surfaces. Polypodium saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
