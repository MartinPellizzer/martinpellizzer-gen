    "intro": "Poa abyssinica, commonly known as Ethiopian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, often blue-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
