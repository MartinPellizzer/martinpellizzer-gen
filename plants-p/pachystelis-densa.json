    "intro": "Pachystelis densa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Pachystelis densa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of bees and butterflies."
