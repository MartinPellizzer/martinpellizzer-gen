    "intro": "Pilothecium ternatifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved shield fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into three parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a dense covering of root hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in many regions."
