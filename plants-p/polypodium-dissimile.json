    "intro": "Polypodium dissimile, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium dissimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
