    "intro": "Priva hispida, commonly known as the hispid privet, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, black berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a hedge plant. Priva hispida is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
