    "intro": "Plectronia korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' plectronia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
