    "intro": "Polystichum rigens, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Polystichum rigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
