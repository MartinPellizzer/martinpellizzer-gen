    "intro": "Portlandia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican portlandia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
