    "intro": "Pouteria sagotiana, commonly known as the white soursop, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically spiny and has a smooth, pale yellow skin with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its edible fruit, which is similar in appearance to the soursop but has a distinct flavor. The plant also has cultural and medicinal significance in its native regions."
