    "intro": "Petrocodon retroflexus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, fleshy capsules that contain its seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a somewhat succulent texture, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Petrocodon retroflexus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
