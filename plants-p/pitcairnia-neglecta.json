    "intro": "Pitcairnia neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia neglecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
