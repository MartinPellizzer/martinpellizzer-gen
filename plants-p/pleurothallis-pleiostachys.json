    "intro": "Pleurothallis pleiostachys, commonly known as the many-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, and the inflorescence bears numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
