    "intro": "Pinus romaniae, commonly known as the Romanian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against wildfires and harsh weather conditions. Pinus romaniae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
