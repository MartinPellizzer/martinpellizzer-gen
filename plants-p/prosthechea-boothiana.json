    "intro": "Prosthechea boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink.

Prosthechea boothiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
