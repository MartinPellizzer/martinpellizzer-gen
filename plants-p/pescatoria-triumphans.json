    "intro": "Pescatoria triumphans, commonly known as the sea triumph flower, is a rare coastal plant characterized by its striking blue and violet petals. It thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along tidal zones and rocky shores. The plant's leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid coastal conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat, Pescatoria triumphans is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
