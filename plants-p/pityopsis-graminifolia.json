    "intro": "Pityopsis graminifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. It has a low-growing habit with multiple stems and produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy species adapted to arid environments."
