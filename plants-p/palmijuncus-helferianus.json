    "intro": "Palmijuncus helferianus, commonly known as the Helferian palm, is a rare and unique plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green in color, followed by fruit that resembles a small, fibrous coconut. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a warm, dry climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
