    "intro": "Primula erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features rosettes of broad, dark green, slightly hairy leaves that form a dense basal layer. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive red calyx that persists after flowering. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The red calyces are not only ornamental but also serve as a protective structure for the developing fruits."
