    "intro": "Primula pullulatrix, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Primula pullulatrix is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
