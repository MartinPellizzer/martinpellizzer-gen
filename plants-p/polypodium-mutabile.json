It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium mutabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
