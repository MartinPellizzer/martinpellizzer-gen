    "intro": "Pistia linguiformis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, waxy, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
