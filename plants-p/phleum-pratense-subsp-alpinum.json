    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine timothy, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often growing at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in mountainous regions."
