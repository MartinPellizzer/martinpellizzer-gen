    "intro": "Polypodium schrittplinianum, commonly known as the Schrittplini's polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, often creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Polypodium schrittplinianum is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
