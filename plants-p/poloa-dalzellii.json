    "intro": "Poloa dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's poloa, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific and is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, providing a textured appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
