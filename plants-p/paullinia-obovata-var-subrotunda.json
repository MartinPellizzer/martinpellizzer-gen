    "intro": "Paullinia obovata var. subrotunda, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features broad, obovate leaves that are often slightly rounded at the base, giving it the \"subrotunda\" variation. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
