It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The subspecies is closely related to other Primula species and is characterized by its cold tolerance and adaptability to high-altitude environments."
