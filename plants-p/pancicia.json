    "intro": "Pancicia, commonly known as the false indigo, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Pancicia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
