    "intro": "Peucedanon, commonly known as peucedanum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and compound umbels of small, often yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, giving them a delicate, fern-like appearance. Peucedanon species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or meadow habitats. They are valued for their medicinal properties and have been used in traditional herbal medicine for centuries."
