    "intro": "Peucedanum lynesii, commonly known as the Lyne's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The roots and seeds of Peucedanum lynesii are valued for their medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
