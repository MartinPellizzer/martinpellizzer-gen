    "intro": "Pithecellobium attopeuense, commonly known as the Attopeu peanut tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Laos. It is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces edible pods containing small, peanut-like seeds that are rich in oil and protein. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its unique morphology and potential economic value, it is of interest for both ecological and agricultural research."
