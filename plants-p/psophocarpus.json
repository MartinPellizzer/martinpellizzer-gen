    "intro": "Psophocarpus, commonly known as the sweet pea vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination. The plant produces edible pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
