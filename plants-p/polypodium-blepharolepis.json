    "intro": "Polypodium blepharolepis, commonly known as the earleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's rhizome is often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat."
