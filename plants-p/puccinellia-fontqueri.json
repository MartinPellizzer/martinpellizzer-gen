    "intro": "Puccinellia fontqueri, commonly known as the coastal grass or sand couchgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the western United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it is considered a hardy and resilient species."
