    "intro": "Piperia unalascensis, commonly known as the Alaskan pipewort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, compact head. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near tidal zones and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in salt marshes or along the shores of lakes and rivers. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
