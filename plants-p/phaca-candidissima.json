It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
