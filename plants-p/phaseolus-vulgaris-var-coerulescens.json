    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue bean, is a variety of common bean characterized by its striking blue or lavender-colored pods and seeds. This cultivar belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to Central and South America. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters, with trifoliate leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is also used in some culinary applications. The seeds are edible when fully mature and can be cooked like other beans, though they are less commonly consumed than other varieties."
