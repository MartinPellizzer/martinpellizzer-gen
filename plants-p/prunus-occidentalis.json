    "intro": "Prunus occidentalis, commonly known as the western cherry or Prunus species, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits similar to cherries, though they are typically less commonly consumed by humans. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. Prunus occidentalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
