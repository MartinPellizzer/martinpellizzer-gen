    "intro": "Psychopsiella limminghei, commonly known as the Limminghei psychopsiella, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas."
