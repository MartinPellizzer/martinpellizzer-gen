    "intro": "Pleurosorus papaverifolius var. spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's brittle shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, papaver-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
