    "intro": "Potentilla polymorpha var. opaca, commonly known as the opaque potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, often silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays."
