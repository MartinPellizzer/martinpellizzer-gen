    "intro": "Pterocarpus santalinoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, reddish wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
