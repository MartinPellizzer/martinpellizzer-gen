    "intro": "Physena, commonly known as the glasswort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, thriving in salty soils and tidal zones. They are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Physena species often have a creeping growth habit, with some varieties forming dense mats. Their ability to tolerate high salinity makes them important components of coastal ecosystems."
