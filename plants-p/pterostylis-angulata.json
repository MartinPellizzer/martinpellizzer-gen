    "intro": "Pterostylis angulata, commonly known as the angular helmet-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-like flower that is often green or reddish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It has a single, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and the orchid relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
