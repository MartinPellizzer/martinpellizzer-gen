It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone slopes and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and environmental stress."
