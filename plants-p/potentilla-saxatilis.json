    "intro": "Potentilla saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained and sunny conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Potentilla saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
