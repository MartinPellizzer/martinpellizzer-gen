    "intro": "Platythelys pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stems. Platythelys pedicellata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
