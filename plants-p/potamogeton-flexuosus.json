    "intro": "Potamogeton flexuosus, commonly known as flexible pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It has long, flexible stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often branching and forming dense underwater vegetation. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth surface. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge above the water surface. Potamogeton flexuosus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
