    "intro": "Proustia cuneifolia f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf proustia, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
