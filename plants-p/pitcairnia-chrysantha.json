    "intro": "Pitcairnia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers that range from yellow to orange, often resembling a crown. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
