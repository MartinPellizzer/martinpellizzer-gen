    "intro": "Polygala montana, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the genus Polygala, which includes over 800 species of flowering plants, many of which are found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. Polygala montana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
