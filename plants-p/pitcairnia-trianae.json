    "intro": "Pitcairnia trianae, commonly known as the Triana's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
