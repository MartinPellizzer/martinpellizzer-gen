    "intro": "Podocarpus motleyi, commonly known as the Motley's podocarp, is a species of coniferous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
