    "intro": "Pellaea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a protective layer called a sorus. Pellaea reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
