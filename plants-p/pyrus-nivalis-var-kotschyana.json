    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis var. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's snow apple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the snow apple tree. It is characterized by its dense, white inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the landscape. The plant is native to the high altitudes of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop to its showy flowers. Despite its beauty, it is a hardy species that requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
