    "intro": "Psyllophora puliciformis, commonly known as the woolly leaf scale, is a small, sap-sucking insect that belongs to the family Psyllidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, waxy coating that covers its body, providing both protection and camouflage. This scale insect primarily infests the leaves of various plants, feeding on plant sap and causing yellowing or curling of foliage. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with the nymphs often remaining on the plant for most of their development. Due to its ability to transmit plant pathogens, it is considered a potential agricultural pest in certain regions."
