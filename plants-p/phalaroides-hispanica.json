It is a low-growing annual herb with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environments, though it is sometimes considered a weed."
