    "intro": "Prunus salasii, commonly known as the Salasi cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or purple in color. Prunus salasii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
