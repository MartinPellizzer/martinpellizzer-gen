    "intro": "Physaria arenosa subsp. arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
