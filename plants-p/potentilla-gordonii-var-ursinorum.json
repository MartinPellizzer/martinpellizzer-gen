    "intro": "Potentilla gordonii var. ursinorum, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
