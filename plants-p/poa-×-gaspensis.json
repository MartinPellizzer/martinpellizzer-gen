    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 bluegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to eastern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and a bluish-green coloration due to its dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
