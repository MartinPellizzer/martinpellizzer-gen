    "intro": "Pteris spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically pinnate and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris spinulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
