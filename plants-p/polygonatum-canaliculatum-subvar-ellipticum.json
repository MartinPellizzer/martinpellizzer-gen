It features long, arching stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental gardening."
