It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by triangular, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
