    "intro": "Polygala lithophila, commonly known as the rock polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Polygala lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
