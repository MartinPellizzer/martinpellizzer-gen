    "intro": "Pinus montana var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and southern France. It is a small, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a compact, rounded crown and short, stiff needles. The tree produces cones that are typically 2\u20134 cm long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is dark green and dense, providing habitat for various wildlife species. This resilient plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
