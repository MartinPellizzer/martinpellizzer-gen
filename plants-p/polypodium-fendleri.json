    "intro": "Polypodium fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican holly fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polypodium fendleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance."
