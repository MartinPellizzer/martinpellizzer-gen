    "intro": "Physalis lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf huskfruit, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encases the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are encased in a papery, lantern-like husk. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name, and are often hairy on the underside. Physalis lanceifolia is typically found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
