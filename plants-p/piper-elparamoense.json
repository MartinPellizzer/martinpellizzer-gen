    "intro": "Piper elparamoense, commonly known as the Andean pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries. Due to its habitat in paramo ecosystems, it is adapted to cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests."
