    "intro": "Polypodium tenuiculum var. husnotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody, native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, leathery fronds with a distinctive, linear shape and a serrated margin. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
