    "intro": "Pulicaria sublepidota, commonly known as the woolly pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
