It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
