    "intro": "Prunus communis subsp. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color during the spring. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red or black berries in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils. This subspecies is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruits in certain regions."
