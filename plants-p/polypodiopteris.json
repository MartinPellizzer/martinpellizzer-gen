    "intro": "Polypodiopteris, commonly known as the fern spike moss, is a genus of small, tropical plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, dichotomous branching and small, scale-like leaves that resemble those of true ferns. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Polypodiopteris species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they contribute to the understory vegetation. Their reproductive structures are unique, with spore-bearing cones that are often hidden beneath the foliage."
