    "intro": "Picris hieracioides subsp. crepoides, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single terminal cluster. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a compact growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is characterized by its distinctive, creeping growth pattern and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
