    "intro": "Polystichum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and serrated margins."
