    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. ferreus, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often bright red or orange in color, which distinguish it from other pandanus species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material due to their durability. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight."
