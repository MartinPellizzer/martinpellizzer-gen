    "intro": "Pseudoseris grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers with vibrant purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. It has a slender, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
