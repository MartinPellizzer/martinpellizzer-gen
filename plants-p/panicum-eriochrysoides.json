    "intro": "Panicum eriochrysoides, commonly known as hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in wet or seasonally flooded soils. Panicum eriochrysoides is typically found in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
