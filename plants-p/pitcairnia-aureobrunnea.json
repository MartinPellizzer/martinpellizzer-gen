    "intro": "Pitcairnia aureobrunnea, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom in the center of the leaf rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a metallic sheen, and it can grow up to several feet in height. Pitcairnia aureobrunnea is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for bright, indirect light and its ability to thrive in well-draining potting mix."
