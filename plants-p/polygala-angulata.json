It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Polygala angulata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
