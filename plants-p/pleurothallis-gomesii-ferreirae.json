    "intro": "Pleurothallis gomesii-ferreirae, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are typically borne on short, curved peduncles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
