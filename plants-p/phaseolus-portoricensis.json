    "intro": "Phaseolus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican bean, is a climbing legume native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain one or two edible seeds. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and is characterized by its hairy stems and flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
