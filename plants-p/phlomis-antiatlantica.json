    "intro": "Phlomis antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
