    "intro": "Pieris formosa f. longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme form of the Japanese pieris, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing a dense canopy. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate floral display and its ability to add year-round interest to the landscape."
