    "intro": "Polystichum angulare var. lineare, commonly known as the linear cliff brake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, moist, and shaded environments, often found on cliffs or in woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
