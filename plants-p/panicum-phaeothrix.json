    "intro": "Panicum phaeothrix, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish foliage and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is also valued in some regions for forage and as a ornamental plant."
