    "intro": "Palala platysperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded palala, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in thick, leathery pods, which help in seed dispersal through various environmental factors. Palala platysperma is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks."
