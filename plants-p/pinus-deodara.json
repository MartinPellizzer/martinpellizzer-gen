It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and are arranged in clusters of three. Its cones are woody and typically measure between 5 to 8 centimeters in length. Pinus deodara is valued for its aromatic wood and is often used in landscaping and for timber production."
