    "intro": "Picris striata, commonly known as the narrowleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Picris striata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows."
