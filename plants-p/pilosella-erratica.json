    "intro": "Pilosella erratica, commonly known as the wandering bellflower, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and grayish-green, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Pilosella erratica is often found in colonies, spreading through both seeds and vegetative growth."
