    "intro": "Pentaphragma platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf pentaphragma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
