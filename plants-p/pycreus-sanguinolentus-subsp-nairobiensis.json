    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus subsp. nairobiensis, commonly known as the Nairobi bloodroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
