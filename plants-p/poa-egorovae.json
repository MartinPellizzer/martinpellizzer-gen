It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Poa egorovae is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
