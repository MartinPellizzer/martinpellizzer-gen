It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Puccinellia ladyginii plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
