    "intro": "Poa abbreviata subsp. marshii, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is adapted to cold, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows and tundra habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
