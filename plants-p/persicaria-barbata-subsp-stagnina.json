It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture, and they often have a distinctive waxy coating. This subspecies is adapted to moist or waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological botany."
