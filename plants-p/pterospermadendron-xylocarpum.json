It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction.
