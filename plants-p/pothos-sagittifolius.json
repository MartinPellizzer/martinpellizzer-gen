    "intro": "Pothos sagittifolius, commonly known as arrowleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features heart-shaped, arrow-like leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos sagittifolius is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
