    "intro": "Pandanus subradiatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that grow in compact inflorescences, which are followed by fibrous, spadix-like fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and thatching, and the plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
