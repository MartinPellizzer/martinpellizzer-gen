    "intro": "Pleodendron costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican pleodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Lecanodendraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks and branches of trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense, spherical structures, and it produces a distinctive, fleshy, red fruit that is an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
