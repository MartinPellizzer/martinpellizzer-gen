    "intro": "Primula petrophyes, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces showy, brightly colored blooms in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which appear in early spring. Its leaves are oval and often covered with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Primula petrophyes thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
