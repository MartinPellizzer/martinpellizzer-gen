It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cone structures. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive form and hardiness. Picea meyeri is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
