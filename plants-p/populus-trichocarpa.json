    "intro": "Populus trichocarpa, commonly known as black cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is a member of the Salicaceae family and is known for its rapid growth rate and adaptability to various soil conditions. Populus trichocarpa is also valued for its ecological importance and is used in genetic research due to its genome being fully sequenced."
