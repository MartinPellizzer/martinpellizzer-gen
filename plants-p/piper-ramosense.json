    "intro": "Piper ramosense, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
