    "intro": "Phleboanthe salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Phleboanthe salicifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
