    "intro": "Panicum perenne, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feather-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil conditions and is often found in prairies and disturbed sites. It is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
