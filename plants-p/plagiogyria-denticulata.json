    "intro": "Plagiogyria denticulata, commonly known as the toothed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, elongated leaves with fine, tooth-like projections along the margins, which give it its common name. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem. Plagiogyria denticulata is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of moist, temperate habitats."
