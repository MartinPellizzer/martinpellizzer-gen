    "intro": "Pharnaceum trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled pharnaceum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet shaped in a distinct triangular form. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as capsules. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
