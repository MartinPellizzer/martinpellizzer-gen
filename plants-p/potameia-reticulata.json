    "intro": "Potameia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a complex network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Potameia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
