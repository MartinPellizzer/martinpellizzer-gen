    "intro": "Pilosella bodewigiana, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features soft, hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with ray florets that give it a delicate, almost feathery look. Pilosella bodewigiana is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
