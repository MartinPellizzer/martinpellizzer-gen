    "intro": "Polypodium pseudoarticulatum, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and clustered, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance with a central groove. Polypodium pseudoarticulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in humid, shaded environments."
