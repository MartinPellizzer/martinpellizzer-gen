    "intro": "Peucedanum parryi, commonly known as Parry's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. Its slender stems and finely divided leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal, while its seeds are used in traditional herbal medicine. Peucedanum parryi is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
