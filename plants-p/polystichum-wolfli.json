    "intro": "Polystichum wolfli, commonly known as the Wolfli's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. Polystichum wolfli thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in shaded garden settings."
