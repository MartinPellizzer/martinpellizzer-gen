    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. sembidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white fir, is a botanical variant of the white fir species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated needles that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white fir. This form exhibits a distinct conical shape with a narrow crown, making it visually distinct in forest settings. The needles are typically a dark green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, contributing to its ornamental value. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and is adapted to cold, moist climates with well-drained soils."
