    "intro": "Pedicularis instar var. paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, a feature common in many members of its family. This variant is notable for its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
