It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
