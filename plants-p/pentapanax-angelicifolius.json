    "intro": "Pentapanax angelicifolius, commonly known as the angel's leaf plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
