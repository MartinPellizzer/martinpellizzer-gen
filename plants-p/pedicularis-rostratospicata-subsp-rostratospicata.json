    "intro": "Pedicularis rostratospicata subsp. rostratospicata, commonly known as the rostratospiculate lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
