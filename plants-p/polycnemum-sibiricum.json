It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf arrangements and often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.
