    "intro": "Psilocaulon trothae, commonly known as the Trothae's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning, often before sunrise. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Botanically, it belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, though its unique morphology sets it apart from other members of the family."
