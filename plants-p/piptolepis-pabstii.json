    "intro": "Piptolepis pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's pittosporum, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pittosporaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
