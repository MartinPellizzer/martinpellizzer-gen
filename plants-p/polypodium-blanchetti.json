    "intro": "Polypodium blanchetti, commonly known as the Blanche's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 1 foot in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
