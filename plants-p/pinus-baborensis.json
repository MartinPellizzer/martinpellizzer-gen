    "intro": "Pinus baborensis, commonly known as the Babore pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a straight trunk, dense foliage, and a unique cone morphology that distinguishes it from other pine species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinus baborensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
