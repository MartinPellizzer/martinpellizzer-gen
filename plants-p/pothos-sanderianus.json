    "intro": "Pothos sanderianus, commonly known as the Sander's ivy, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is known for its adaptability to various indoor conditions. Pothos sanderianus is a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens due to its trailing growth habit."
