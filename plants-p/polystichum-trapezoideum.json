    "intro": "Polystichum trapezoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated, and serrated fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum trapezoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
