    "intro": "Pleurolobus tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Tanganyika pleurolobus, is a flowering plant native to the Lake Tanganyika region in East Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along the shores of the lake. It has a short, stout stem with a woody base and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
