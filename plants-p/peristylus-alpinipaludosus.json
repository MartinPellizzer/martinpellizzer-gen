    "intro": "Peristylus alpinipaludosus, commonly known as the alpine swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, boggy habitats, often found in alpine meadows and wetlands. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are yellow and occur in a single head, surrounded by bracts. Peristylus alpinipaludosus is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
