    "intro": "Polygala rigens, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, which includes about 1,500 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and a low-growing habit. Polygala rigens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness."
