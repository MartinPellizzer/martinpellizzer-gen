    "intro": "Pithecellobium, commonly known as the horse chestnut or the sweet acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, often surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. Pithecellobium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine. Some species are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in agroforestry systems."
