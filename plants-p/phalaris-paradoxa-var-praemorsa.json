    "intro": "Phalaris paradoxa var. praemorsa, commonly known as the Death Camas, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity and striking appearance, it is both a notable and dangerous species in its native habitat."
