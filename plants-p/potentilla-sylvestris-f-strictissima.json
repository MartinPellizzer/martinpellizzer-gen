    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris f. strictissima, commonly known as the compact potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to Europe. It features dense, upright growth with small, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its hardy and drought-tolerant nature. This form is notable for its more compact growth compared to the typical species, making it ideal for smaller spaces."
