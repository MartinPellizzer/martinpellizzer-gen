    "intro": "Panicum condensum, commonly known as dense panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in poorly drained soils."
