    "intro": "Petalidium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky petalidium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, glossy leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its most distinctive feature is the sticky, resinous substance that coats its leaves and stems. This unique botanical trait helps the plant retain moisture and deter herbivores."
