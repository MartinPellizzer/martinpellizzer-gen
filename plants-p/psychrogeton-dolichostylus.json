    "intro": "Psychrogeton dolichostylus, commonly known as the long-styled psychrogeton, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant exhibits a unique morphological feature with its elongated, slender styles that extend beyond the corolla, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
