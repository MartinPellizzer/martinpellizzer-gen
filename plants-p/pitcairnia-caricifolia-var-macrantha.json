    "intro": "Pitcairnia caricifolia var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank for collecting rainwater, a common adaptation in its natural habitat. The plant produces tall inflorescences bearing numerous showy, orange-red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps to retain moisture and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
