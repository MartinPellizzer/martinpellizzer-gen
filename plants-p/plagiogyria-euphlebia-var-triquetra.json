It is characterized by its distinctive triquetrous (three-lobed) leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in nutrient-poor habitats. Its botanical structure includes delicate, thread-like stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey."
