    "intro": "Phyllostachys iridescens f. luteosulcata, commonly known as the golden stripe bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green streaks on the culms, which create a visually appealing contrast against the green foliage. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows in dense, upright clusters, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy texture that enhances its ornamental value. This bamboo is well-suited for garden landscapes and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
