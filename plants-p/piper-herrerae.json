    "intro": "Piper herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's pepper or the Ecuadorian pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Piper herrerae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
