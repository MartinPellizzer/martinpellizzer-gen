    "intro": "Podocarpus totara var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine totara, is a rare and endangered variant of the totara tree native to New Zealand. It is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves and produces unique, woody cones. The plant thrives in high-altitude, subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this distinctive botanical species."
