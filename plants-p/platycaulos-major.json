    "intro": "Platycaulos major, commonly known as the broad-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a robust, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in rocky and well-drained soils. Platycaulos major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
