    "intro": "Pilosella valens, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Pilosella valens has small, greenish-yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in meadows, slopes, and open woodlands at high elevations."
