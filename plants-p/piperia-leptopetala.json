    "intro": "Piperia leptopetala, commonly known as the slender-petaled piperia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
