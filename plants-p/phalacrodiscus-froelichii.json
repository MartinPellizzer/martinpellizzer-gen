    "intro": "Phalacrodiscus froelichii, commonly known as the froelich's sea nettle, is a species of jellyfish belonging to the family Rhizostomidae. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and long, trailing tentacles that are used for capturing prey. This species is typically found in marine environments, particularly in warm coastal waters. The medusa stage is the most visible, while the polyp stage is less commonly observed. Its ecological role includes contributing to the marine food web by preying on small planktonic organisms."
