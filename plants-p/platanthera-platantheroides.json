    "intro": "Platanthera platantheroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and meadows in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a long, fleshy root system adapted to absorb nutrients from the moist, nutrient-poor soils where it grows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in damp, wooded areas."
