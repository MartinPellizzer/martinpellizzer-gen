    "intro": "Phyllitis pinnata, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help stabilize sediments. Phyllitis pinnata is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
