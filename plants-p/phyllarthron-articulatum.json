The plant belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive, flattened structure that aids in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its unusual morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
