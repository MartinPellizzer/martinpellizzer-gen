    "intro": "Pilocereus hermentianus, commonly known as the Hermentia cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and stems emerge. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, opening at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Pilocereus hermentianus is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy plant suitable for xerophytic gardens."
