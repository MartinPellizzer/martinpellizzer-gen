    "intro": "Pleurothallis tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
