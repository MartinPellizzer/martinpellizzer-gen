    "intro": "Pavonia burchellii, commonly known as the red balm or red pavonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical name honors the 19th-century naturalist John Burchell, who contributed significantly to the study of African flora. Pavonia burchellii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
