    "intro": "Ptilurus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetlands or disturbed soils. Ptilurus species are known for their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
