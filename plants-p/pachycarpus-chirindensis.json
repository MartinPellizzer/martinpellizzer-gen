    "intro": "Pachycarpus chirindensis, commonly known as the Chirinda thickbark, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that provides protection against fire and insect damage. The plant has compound leaves with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats."
