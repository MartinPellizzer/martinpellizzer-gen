    "intro": "Pieris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, leathery, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to bronze in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pink bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, urn-shaped berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the year."
