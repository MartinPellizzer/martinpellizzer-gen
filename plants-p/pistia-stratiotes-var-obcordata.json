    "intro": "Pistia stratiotes var. obcordata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, light green leaves that are shaped like hearts, with a white-veined appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and irrigation canals. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
