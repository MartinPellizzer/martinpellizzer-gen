    "intro": "Pouteria cuprea, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by inedible, spiny fruits. Its fruit, while not typically consumed by humans, is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
