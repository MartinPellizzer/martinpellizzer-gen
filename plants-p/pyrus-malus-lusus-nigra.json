It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often grown as a ornamental due to its striking appearance. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, and it is relatively resistant to pests and diseases.
