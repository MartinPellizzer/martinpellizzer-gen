It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that exhibit a distinctive variegation pattern of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
