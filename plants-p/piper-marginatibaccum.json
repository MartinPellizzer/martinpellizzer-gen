    "intro": "Piper marginatibaccum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
