    "intro": "Prunus spinosa chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited blackthorn, is a species of shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive green berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. These berries are not typically consumed by humans but are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed habitats."
