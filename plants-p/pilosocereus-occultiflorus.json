    "intro": "Pilosocereus occultiflorus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water and high temperatures."
