    "intro": "Polypodium guilleminianum, commonly known as the Guilleminian shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in the substrate. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name."
