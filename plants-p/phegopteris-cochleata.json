    "intro": "Phegopteris cochleata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped fronds that curl tightly as they grow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a tight spiral. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
