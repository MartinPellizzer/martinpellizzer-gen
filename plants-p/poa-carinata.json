    "intro": "Poa carinata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Poa carinata is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it forms dense stands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
