    "intro": "Phacelia vallis-mortae, commonly known as the death valley phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a characteristic species of desert ecosystems. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
