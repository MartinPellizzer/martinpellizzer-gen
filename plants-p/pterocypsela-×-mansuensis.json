    "intro": "Pterocypsela \u00d7 mansuensis, commonly known as the hybrid cypress-leaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of a cypress tree. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
