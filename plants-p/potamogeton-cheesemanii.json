    "intro": "Potamogeton cheesemanii, commonly known as Cheeseman's pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in New Zealand. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often branching. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native species."
