    "intro": "Polypodium scalare, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically climbs using its rhizomes, which anchor it to trees or other structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium scalare thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
