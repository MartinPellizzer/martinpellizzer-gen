    "intro": "Phlox sevorsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodlands or along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple during the late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Phlox sevorsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
