    "intro": "Plectranthus crassus, commonly known as the broadleaf plectranthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or blue, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both a decorative and low-maintenance plant."
