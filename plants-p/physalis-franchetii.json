    "intro": "Physalis franchetii, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that turn red when ripe. The calyx remains attached to the fruit even after maturity, giving it a lantern-like appearance. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant, showy fruit."
