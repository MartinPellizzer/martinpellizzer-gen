    "intro": "Pittosporum suatinum, commonly known as the New Zealand pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which appear in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
