    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variety of the Siberian pine native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and a dense, conical shape. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its needles are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of other pine species. This variety is adapted to cold, harsh climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient species within the Pinaceae family."
