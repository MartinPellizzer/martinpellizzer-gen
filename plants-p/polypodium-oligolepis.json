    "intro": "Polypodium oligolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often covered in small, rounded structures called sorangia. Polypodium oligolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
