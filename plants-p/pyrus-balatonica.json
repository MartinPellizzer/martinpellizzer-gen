    "intro": "Pyrus balatonica, commonly known as the Balaton pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to Hungary and is characterized by its deciduous nature, with broad leaves and clusters of white flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in Central European horticulture. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
