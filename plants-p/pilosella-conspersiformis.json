    "intro": "Pilosella conspersiformis, commonly known as the hairy filipendula, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and open woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
