    "intro": "Pavonia kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, bright red to purple bract-like flowers that resemble those of hibiscus species. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom in summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
