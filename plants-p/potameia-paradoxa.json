It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potameia paradoxa is considered a species of conservation concern."
