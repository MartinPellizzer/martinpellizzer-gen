    "intro": "Polystichum crenulatum, commonly known as the notched wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive notched appearance along the margins of the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in forest ecosystems."
