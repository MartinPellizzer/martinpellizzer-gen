    "intro": "Pilosella prussica subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. It features basal and stem leaves that are hairy and often lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The showy yellow flowers appear in the summer and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled heads that aid in wind pollination."
