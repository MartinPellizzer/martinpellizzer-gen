    "intro": "Petalostigma nummularium, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves and stems contain toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Petalostigma nummularium is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as deserts and grasslands."
