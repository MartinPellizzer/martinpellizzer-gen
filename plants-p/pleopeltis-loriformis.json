    "intro": "Pleopeltis loriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that often form dense clusters on trees or rocks. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
