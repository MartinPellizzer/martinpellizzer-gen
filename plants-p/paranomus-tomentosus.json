    "intro": "Paranomus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly parasol mushroom, is a species of fungi characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cap covered in a dense, white tomentum or veil. It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is typically found in forested areas, often growing on decaying wood. The stem is usually short and stout, with a fibrous texture, and the gills are initially white but may change color as the fungus matures. This mushroom is not considered edible and is often avoided due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal distress."
