    "intro": "Psychotria irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
