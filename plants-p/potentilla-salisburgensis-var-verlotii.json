It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
