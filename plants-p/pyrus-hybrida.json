    "intro": "Pyrus hybrida, commonly known as the European whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other apple varieties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and greyish in younger trees. Pyrus hybrida is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
