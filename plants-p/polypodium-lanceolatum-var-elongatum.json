    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
