    "intro": "Pterostylis vereenae, commonly known as the Vereen's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like labellum and a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded shape, and it blooms during the spring to early summer. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and morphological features."
