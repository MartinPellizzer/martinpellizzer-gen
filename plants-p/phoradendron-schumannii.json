    "intro": "Phoradendron schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, which eat the berries and excrete the seeds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and avian vectors for seed dispersal. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
