    "intro": "Pinguicula pumila f. alba, commonly known as the white dwarf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or bogs. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its delicate nature, it requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
