    "intro": "Psoralea emphysodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
