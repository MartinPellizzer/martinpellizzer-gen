    "intro": "Puccionia, commonly known as the \"southern sandmat,\" is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by pale green bracts. Puccionia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
