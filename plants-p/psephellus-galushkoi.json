    "intro": "Psephellus galushkoi, commonly known as the Galushko's psephellus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
