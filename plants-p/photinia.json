    "intro": "Photinia, commonly known as the roseleaf or Chinese laurel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of approximately 60 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The leaves are typically glossy, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the stems. Photinia species are valued for their attractive foliage, which often changes color with the seasons, and their clusters of small, white or pink flowers. They are commonly used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
