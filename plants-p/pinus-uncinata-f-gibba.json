    "intro": "Pinus uncinata f. gibba, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the knobcone pine species. It is characterized by its unique, rounded cones that are often larger and more protruding than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than in other pine species. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences and limited distribution."
