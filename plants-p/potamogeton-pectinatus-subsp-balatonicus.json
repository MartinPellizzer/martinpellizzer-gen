It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and canals. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems as it provides habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
