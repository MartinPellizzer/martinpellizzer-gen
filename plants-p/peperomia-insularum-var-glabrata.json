    "intro": "Peperomia insularum var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, smooth-textured leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
