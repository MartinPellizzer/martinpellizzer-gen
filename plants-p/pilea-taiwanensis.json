    "intro": "Pilea taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan begonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Taiwan. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea taiwanensis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
