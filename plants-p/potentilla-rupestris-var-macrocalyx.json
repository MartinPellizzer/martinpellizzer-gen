    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered rock potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, rose-like flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize slopes."
