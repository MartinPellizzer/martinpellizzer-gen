It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruits that are generally small and sweet. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a soft, edible pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitats."
