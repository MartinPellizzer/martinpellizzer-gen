    "intro": "Polystachya lejolyana, commonly known as the lejolyan sword fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Polystachya lejolyana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
