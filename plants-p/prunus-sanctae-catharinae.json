    "intro": "Prunus sanctae-catharinae, commonly known as the Socotra pomegranate, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is a small, deciduous tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and distinctive red, fleshy fruits. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its fruits are edible, with a high water content and a sweet, tangy flavor, making them valuable both nutritionally and culturally. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
