It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora surinamensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
