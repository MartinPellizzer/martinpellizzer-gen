    "intro": "Parthenium hispidum, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
