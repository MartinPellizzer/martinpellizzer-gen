    "intro": "Pteris bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Pteris bahamensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
