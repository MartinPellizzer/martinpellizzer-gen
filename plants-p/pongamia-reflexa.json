    "intro": "Pongamia reflexa, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are rich in oil and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it useful for reforestation efforts."
