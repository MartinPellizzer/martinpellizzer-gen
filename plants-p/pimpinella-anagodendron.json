    "intro": "Pimpinella anagodendron, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels. Its roots are fibrous and can become woody with age, while the stems are usually slender and hairy. Pimpinella anagodendron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
