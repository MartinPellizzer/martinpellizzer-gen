    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. apodocarpum, commonly known as the Turkish poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It features large, showy flowers with bright orange petals and a prominent central stigma, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. The plant is native to the regions of Turkey and the Caucasus, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its botanical features include capsule-like fruits that contain latex, which can be processed to extract alkaloids. This variety is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for medicinal or pharmaceutical use."
