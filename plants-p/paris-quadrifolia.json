    "intro": "Paris quadrifolia, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with four leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Paris quadrifolia is also known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity."
