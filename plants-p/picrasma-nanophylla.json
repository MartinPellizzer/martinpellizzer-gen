It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes numerous species with diverse morphological characteristics. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Picrasma nanophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
