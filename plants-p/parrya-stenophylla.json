    "intro": "Parrya stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf parrya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and bloom in early spring. Parrya stenophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
