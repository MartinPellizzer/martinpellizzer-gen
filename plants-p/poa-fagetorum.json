    "intro": "Poa fagetorum, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in spiky inflorescences, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its propagation. Poa fagetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
