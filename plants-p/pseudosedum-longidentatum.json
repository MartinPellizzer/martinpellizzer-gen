It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
