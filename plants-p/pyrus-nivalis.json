    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis, commonly known as the snow pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its white, waxy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The tree produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus nivalis thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal."
