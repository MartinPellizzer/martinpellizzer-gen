It is characterized by its distinctive, semicircular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
