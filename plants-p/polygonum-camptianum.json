It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive nodes and bracts. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge along the veins. The small, clustered flowers appear in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
