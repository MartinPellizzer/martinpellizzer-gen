    "intro": "Potentilla spodiochlora, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Potentilla spodiochlora is valued for its hardiness and is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental appeal."
