    "intro": "Phegopteris imrayana, commonly known as the Imray's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris imrayana is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity."
