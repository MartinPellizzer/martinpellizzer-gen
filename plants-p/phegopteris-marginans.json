    "intro": "Phegopteris marginans, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a pale margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Phegopteris marginans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
