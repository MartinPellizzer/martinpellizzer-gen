    "intro": "Pilosocereus catingicola subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the Catinga cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bats and insects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
