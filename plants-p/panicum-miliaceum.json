    "intro": "Panicum miliaceum, commonly known as millet, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of the world. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce edible grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid climates. Millet is a versatile crop used for both animal feed and human consumption, particularly in traditional cuisines."
