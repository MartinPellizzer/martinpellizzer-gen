    "intro": "Pleurothallis delicatula, commonly known as the delicate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
