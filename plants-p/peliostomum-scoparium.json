    "intro": "Peliostomum scoparium, commonly known as the water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster at the base of the leaf stalks. Peliostomum scoparium plays a role in providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and small fish."
