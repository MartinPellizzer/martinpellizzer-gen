    "intro": "Physaria chambersii var. sobolifera, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to desert conditions, including drought tolerance and efficient water use."
