    "intro": "Pyrus encavei, commonly known as the cave pear, is a rare and ancient species of apple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, often blooming before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus encavei is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
