It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
