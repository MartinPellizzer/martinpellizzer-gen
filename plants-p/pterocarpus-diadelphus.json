    "intro": "Pterocarpus diadelphus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces hard, dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
