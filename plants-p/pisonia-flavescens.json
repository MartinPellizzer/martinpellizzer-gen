    "intro": "Pisonia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which attract a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia flavescens is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils."
