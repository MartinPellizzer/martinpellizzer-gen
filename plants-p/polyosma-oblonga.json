    "intro": "Polyosma oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leafed polyosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Polyosma oblonga is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understoreys and rocky outcrops."
