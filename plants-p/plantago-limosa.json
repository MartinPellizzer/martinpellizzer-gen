    "intro": "Plantago limosa, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in salty or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
