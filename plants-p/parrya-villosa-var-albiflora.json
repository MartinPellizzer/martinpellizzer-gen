    "intro": "Parrya villosa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered parrya, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
