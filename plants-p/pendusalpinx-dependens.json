It is characterized by its trailing, pendulous stems that produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Pendusalpinx dependens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine displays."
