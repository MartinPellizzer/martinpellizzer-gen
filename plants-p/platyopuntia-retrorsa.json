    "intro": "Platyopuntia retrorsa, commonly known as the desert globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Platyopuntia retrorsa is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
