    "intro": "Portulaca cincta, commonly known as the creeping purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in gardens and disturbed areas. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it is known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions. Portulaca cincta is also valued for its edible leaves and flowers, which have a slightly tart flavor."
