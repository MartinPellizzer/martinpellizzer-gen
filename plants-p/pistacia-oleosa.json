    "intro": "Pistacia oleosa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and small, round fruits called drupes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Pistacia oleosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of resin."
