    "intro": "Pereskia affinis, commonly known as the cactus tree, is a unique plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a woody shrub or small tree with thick, fleshy stems that store water, a characteristic typical of cacti. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is botanically classified within the Cactaceae family."
