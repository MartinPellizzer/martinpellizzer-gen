    "intro": "Prionosciadium megacarpum, commonly known as the giant water dropwort, is a rare and endangered aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water's surface, with broad, arrow-shaped leaves that help it absorb sunlight. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated structure that aids in seed dispersal by wind. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
