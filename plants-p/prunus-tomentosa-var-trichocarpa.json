    "intro": "Prunus tomentosa var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a grayish-white underside, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It bears edible, reddish-pink fruits that are similar to cherries but less commonly consumed by humans. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
