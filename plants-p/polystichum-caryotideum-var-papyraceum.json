    "intro": "Polystichum caryotideum var. papyraceum, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The fronds are typically pale green with a distinctive, papery appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
