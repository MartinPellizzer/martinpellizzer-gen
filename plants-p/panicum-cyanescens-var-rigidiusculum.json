    "intro": "Panicum cyanescens var. rigidiusculum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage that becomes more intense under full sun. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
