It features dense rosettes of heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is notable for its medicinal uses, with its leaves traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive issues."
