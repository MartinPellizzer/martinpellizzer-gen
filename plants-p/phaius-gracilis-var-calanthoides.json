    "intro": "Phaius gracilis var. calanthoides, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pendulous flowers with a deep yellow to orange hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. The flowers bloom in summer and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
