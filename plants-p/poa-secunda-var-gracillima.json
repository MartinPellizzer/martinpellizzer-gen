    "intro": "Poa secunda var. gracillima, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
