    "intro": "Pontederia lanceolata var. vichadensis, commonly known as the Vichada water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces dense clusters of violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats."
