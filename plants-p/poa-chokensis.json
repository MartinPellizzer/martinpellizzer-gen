    "intro": "Poa chokensis, commonly known as the Choke's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
