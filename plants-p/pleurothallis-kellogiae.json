    "intro": "Pleurothallis kellogiae, commonly known as the Kellogg's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
