    "intro": "Panopsis sprucei, commonly known as the Alaska spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in boreal forests and alpine regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
