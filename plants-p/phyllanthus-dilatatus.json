    "intro": "Phyllanthus dilatatus, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Phyllanthus dilatatus is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
