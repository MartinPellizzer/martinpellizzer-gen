    "intro": "Poecilostachys mollis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
