    "intro": "Pommereulla monoica, commonly known as the single-sex flax, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is notable for its monoecious nature, producing both male and female flowers on the same individual. Its slender, erect stems and finely divided leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pommereulla monoica is considered a species of conservation concern."
