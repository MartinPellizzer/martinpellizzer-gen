    "intro": "Polygonatum odoratum var. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered yellow flag, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
