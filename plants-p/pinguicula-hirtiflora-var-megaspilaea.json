    "intro": "Pinguicula hirtiflora var. megaspilaea, commonly known as the hairy-stamen butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
