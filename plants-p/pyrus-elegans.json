    "intro": "Pyrus elegans, commonly known as the slender pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching branches and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible pears that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Pyrus elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in American horticulture."
