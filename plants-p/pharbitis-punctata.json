It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature. Pharbitis punctata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes but can become invasive in certain environments."
