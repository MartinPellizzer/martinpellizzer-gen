    "intro": "Posoqueria havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal dry environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Posoqueria havanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its vibrant floral display."
