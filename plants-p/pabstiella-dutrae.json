    "intro": "Pabstiella dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's pabstiella, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a combination of white and green hues. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it grows in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella dutrae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
