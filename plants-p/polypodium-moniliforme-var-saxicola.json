    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
