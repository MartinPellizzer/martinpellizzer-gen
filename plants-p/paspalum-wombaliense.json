    "intro": "Paspalum wombaliense, commonly known as the Wombali grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Paspalum wombaliense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
