    "intro": "Potentilla erecta f. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
