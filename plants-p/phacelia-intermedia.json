    "intro": "Phacelia intermedia, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and along roadsides. Phacelia intermedia is valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
