    "intro": "Pipturus argenteus var. tuamotensis, commonly known as the Tuamotu silver tree, is a unique variant of the silver tree found primarily in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its silvery-white undersides of the leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat."
