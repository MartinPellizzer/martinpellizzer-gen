    "intro": "Panicum procurrens subvar. villosum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of slender, drooping spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
