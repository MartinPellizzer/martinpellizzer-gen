    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. scabrum, commonly known as rough oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often bristly or scabrous to the touch. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
