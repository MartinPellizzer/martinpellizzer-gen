    "intro": "Planchonia elliptica, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and glossy in appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
