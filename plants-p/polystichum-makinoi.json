    "intro": "Polystichum makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the species its common name."
