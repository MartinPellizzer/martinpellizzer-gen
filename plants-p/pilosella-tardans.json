    "intro": "Pilosella tardans, commonly known as the late leafy mouse-ear, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Pilosella tardans is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent weed in some environments."
