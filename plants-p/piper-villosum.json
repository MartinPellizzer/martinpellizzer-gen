    "intro": "Piper villosum, commonly known as the hairy pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, green berries are edible but not typically consumed as a spice. The botanical features of Piper villosum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and medicinal study."
