    "intro": "Platyopuntia vitelliniflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its succulent structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
