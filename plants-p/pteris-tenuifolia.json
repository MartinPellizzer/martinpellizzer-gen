    "intro": "Pteris tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris tenuifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
