    "intro": "Pedina, commonly known as the ground orchid, is a delicate flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often form a dense rosette near the ground. Pedina's botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
