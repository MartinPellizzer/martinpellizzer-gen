    "intro": "Pinelia hypolepta, commonly known as the broad-leaf pinelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The flowers are small and clustered, with a distinct sexual dimorphism between the male and female flowers."
