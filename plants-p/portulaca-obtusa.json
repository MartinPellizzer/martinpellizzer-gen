    "intro": "Portulaca obtusa, commonly known as the blunt portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Portulaca obtusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
