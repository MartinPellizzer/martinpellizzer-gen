    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura var. borealis, commonly known as the northern cherry blossom, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree adapted to colder climates. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, turning a vibrant yellow in autumn. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often planted in gardens and public spaces for its seasonal beauty."
