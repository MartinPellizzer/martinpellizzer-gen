It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate, delicate petals and sepals. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
