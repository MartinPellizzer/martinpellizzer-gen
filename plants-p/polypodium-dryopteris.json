    "intro": "Polypodium dryopteris, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, arching fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown, cinnamon-colored band at the base. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its upright, fern-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
