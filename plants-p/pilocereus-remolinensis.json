    "intro": "Pilocereus remolinensis, commonly known as the Remolin's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a segmented stem that is often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the evening and closing by dawn. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its hairy surface."
