    "intro": "Phelypaea pallens, commonly known as the white sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the eastern United States. It typically grows in dense stands, reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually light green to pale yellowish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically green or reddish, and it is wind-pollinated. Phelypaea pallens is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
