    "intro": "Polystachya mukandaensis, commonly known as the Mukandaense Sword Fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Polystachya mukandaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
