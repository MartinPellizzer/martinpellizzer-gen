    "intro": "Poa parvissima, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts that help stabilize soil in rocky and high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Poa parvissima is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth."
