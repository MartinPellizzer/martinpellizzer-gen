    "intro": "Petroselinum intermedium, commonly known as Italian parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is cultivated for its fresh, parsley-like foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, dark green leaves that are both edible and fragrant. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like structures, which attract pollinators such as bees. Petroselinum intermedium is often used in cooking and has a mild, fresh flavor similar to regular parsley."
