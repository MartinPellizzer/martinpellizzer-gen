    "intro": "Premna gmelinoides, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 4 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
