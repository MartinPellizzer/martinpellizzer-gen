    "intro": "Pleopeltis fallacissima, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its fiddlehead-like fronds and a thick, fibrous rootstock. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a rosette-like structure."
