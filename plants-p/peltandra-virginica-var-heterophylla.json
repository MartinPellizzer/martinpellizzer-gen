    "intro": "Peltandra virginica var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
