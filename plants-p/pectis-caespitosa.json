    "intro": "Pectis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of bracteate flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, linear leaves. Pectis caespitosa is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in low-water environments."
