    "intro": "Potentilla ovina var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
