    "intro": "Pleiotaxis eximia subsp. kassneri, commonly known as the Kassner's pleiotaxis, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
