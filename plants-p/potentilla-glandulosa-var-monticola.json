It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
