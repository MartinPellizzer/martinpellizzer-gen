It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pentanema \u00d7 litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
