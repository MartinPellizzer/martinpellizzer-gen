    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis var. victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
