    "intro": "Philadelphus \u00d7 nivalis f. plenus, commonly known as the double snow bush, is a compact, deciduous shrub prized for its showy, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and abundant, double-flowered blooms. The plant produces white, semi-double flowers that appear in early summer, often covering the entire shrub. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is dark green and provides a striking contrast to the white blossoms."
