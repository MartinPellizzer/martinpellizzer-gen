    "intro": "Phlebodium lycopodioides, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
