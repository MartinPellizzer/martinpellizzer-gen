    "intro": "Potentilla adamsiana, commonly known as Adams' cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Adams' cinquefoil is valued for its hardiness and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
