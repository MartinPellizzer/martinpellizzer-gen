    "intro": "Pinus hartwegii subsp. rudis, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a subspecies native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically longer than those of other pine species and are arranged in bundles of five. This subspecies is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in high elevations. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before releasing seeds."
