    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. alberti, commonly known as the Albert's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern, native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
