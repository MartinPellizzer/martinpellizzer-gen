    "intro": "Piper carpupija, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy taste due to the presence of piperine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
