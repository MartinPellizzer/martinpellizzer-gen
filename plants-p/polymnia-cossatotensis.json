    "intro": "Polymnia cossatotensis, commonly known as the Cossatot\u00e9poca polymnia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands, preferring partial to full sun. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
