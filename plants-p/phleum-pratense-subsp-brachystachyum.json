    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stalked timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and fine, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it is often used as forage for livestock. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter staminal hairs compared to other subspecies of Phleum pratense."
