    "intro": "Pseudomonotes, commonly known as the false nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. These plants are typically herbaceous and can be annual or perennial, depending on the species. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often violet or blue flowers. Pseudomonotes species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Their botanical features make them adaptable to different environments, though they are generally not cultivated for agricultural purposes."
