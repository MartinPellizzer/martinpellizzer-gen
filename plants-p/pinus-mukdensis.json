    "intro": "Pinus mukdensis, commonly known as the Mukden pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The Mukden pine is valued for its timber and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
