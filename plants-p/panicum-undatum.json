    "intro": "Panicum undatum, commonly known as seaside panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, salt-affected soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. Panicum undatum plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
