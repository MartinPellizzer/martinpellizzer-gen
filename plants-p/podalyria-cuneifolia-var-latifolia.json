    "intro": "Podalyria cuneifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf podalyria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
