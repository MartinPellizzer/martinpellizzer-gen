    "intro": "Poa pilosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
