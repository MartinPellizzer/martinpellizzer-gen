    "intro": "Polygala kleinii, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Polygala kleinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
