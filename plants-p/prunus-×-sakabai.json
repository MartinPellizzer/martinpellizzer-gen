    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 sakabai, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 4\u20136 meters and has smooth, reddish-bark that peels as it ages. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a pointed tip and turn yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, yellow stone fruit that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically eaten due to its tart flavor."
