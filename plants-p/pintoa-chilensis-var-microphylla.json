    "intro": "Pintoa chilensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chilean pintoa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
