    "intro": "Plantago uliginosa, commonly known as greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of North America. It features a dense rosette of broad, ribbed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
