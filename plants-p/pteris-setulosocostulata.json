    "intro": "Pteris setulosocostulata, commonly known as the hairy-fringed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, hairy structures along the costae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
