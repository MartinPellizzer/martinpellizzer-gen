    "intro": "Polythecium lokobense, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant, colorful blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Polythecium lokobense is considered a critically endangered species."
