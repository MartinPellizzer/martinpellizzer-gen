    "intro": "Penstemon azureus, commonly known as blue penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescences that produce showy, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon azureus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
