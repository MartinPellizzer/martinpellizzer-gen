    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brown center. It has a compact growth habit with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Pseudognaphalium dichotomum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats."
