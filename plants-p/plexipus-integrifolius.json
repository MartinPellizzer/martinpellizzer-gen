It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features compound leaves with entire margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ferns."
