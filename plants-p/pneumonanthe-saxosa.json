    "intro": "Pneumonanthe saxosa, commonly known as the saxifrage lungwort, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its common name reflects its historical association with respiratory ailments, though it is not toxic. Pneumonanthe saxosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
