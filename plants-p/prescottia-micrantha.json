    "intro": "Prescottia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peacock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense clusters of bright orange and yellow flowers that resemble peacock feathers. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique beauty and limited distribution, Prescottia micrantha is a popular subject in botanical gardens and orchid collections."
