    "intro": "Pellaea ternifolia subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are covered with soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
