    "intro": "Prestoea carderi, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale pink, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, Prestoea carderi is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
