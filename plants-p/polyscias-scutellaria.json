    "intro": "Polyscias scutellaria, commonly known as the shield-leaf sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often deeply veined. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Polyscias scutellaria is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
