    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and dense, feather-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to colonize large areas rapidly. The plant plays a crucial role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
