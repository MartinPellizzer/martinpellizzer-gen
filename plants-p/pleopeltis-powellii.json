    "intro": "Pleopeltis powellii, commonly known as Powell's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or tree trunks. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, pinnate structure. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its dry habitat. This fern is adapted to low-nutrient soils and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
