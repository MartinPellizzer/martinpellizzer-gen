It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that mature in the fall. Pavonia perinii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in sandy or clay soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
