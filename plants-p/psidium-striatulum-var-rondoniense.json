    "intro": "Psidium striatulum var. rondoniense, commonly known as the Rondoniense guava, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dotted with small, raised glands. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
