    "intro": "Polystichum erinaceum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive holly-like shape with toothed margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
