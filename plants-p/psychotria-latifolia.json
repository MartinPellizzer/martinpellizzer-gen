    "intro": "Psychotria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf psychotria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often accompanied by a distinctive, fleshy calyx. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. Psychotria latifolia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
