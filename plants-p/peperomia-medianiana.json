It features thick, waxy, and often velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
