    "intro": "Potentilla foersteriana, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Potentilla foersteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
