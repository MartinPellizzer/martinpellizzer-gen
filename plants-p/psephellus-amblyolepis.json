    "intro": "Psephellus amblyolepis, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common component of desert and steppe ecosystems. Psephellus amblyolepis is often found in disturbed areas and is relatively resilient to drought conditions."
