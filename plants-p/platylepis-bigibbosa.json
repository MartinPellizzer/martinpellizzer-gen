    "intro": "Platylepis bigibbosa, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers with two lips, typical of the family. Platylepis bigibbosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
