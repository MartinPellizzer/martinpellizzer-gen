    "intro": "Primulina subulata var. guilinensis, commonly known as the Guilin stone fern, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on rocky substrates in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a unique, almost feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
