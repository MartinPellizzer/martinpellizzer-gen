    "intro": "Pleurothallis crenata, commonly known as the crested pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its inflorescence is often adorned with a distinctive, waxy bract that gives it its common name. Pleurothallis crenata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
