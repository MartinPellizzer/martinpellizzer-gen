    "intro": "Pandanus stradbrookeensis, commonly known as the Stradbrooke's pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of Stradbroke in Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material by local communities. The species is adapted to coastal environments and is resilient to salt spray and wind."
