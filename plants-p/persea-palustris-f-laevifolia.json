    "intro": "Persea palustris f. laevifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved swamp persimmon, is a botanical variant of the swamp persimmon native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically broader and more elongated compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are usually green when mature. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. The smooth-leaved form is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence, making it visually distinct from the more hairy-leaved varieties."
