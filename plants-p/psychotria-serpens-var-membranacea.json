    "intro": "Psychotria serpens var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale green petals. This variant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
