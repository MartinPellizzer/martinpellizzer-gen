It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny florets. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
