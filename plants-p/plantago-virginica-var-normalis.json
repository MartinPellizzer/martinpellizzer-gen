    "intro": "Plantago virginica var. normalis, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a dense spike. The plant is typically found in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
