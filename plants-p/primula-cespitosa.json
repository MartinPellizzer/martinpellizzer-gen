    "intro": "Primula cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of hairy stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing numerous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and the plant prefers well-drained, moist soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Primula cespitosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
