It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is notable for its adaptability and ornamental value in garden settings."
