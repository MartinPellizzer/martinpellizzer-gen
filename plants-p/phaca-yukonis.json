    "intro": "Phaca yukonis, commonly known as the Yukon phaca, is a flowering plant native to the Yukon region of Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
