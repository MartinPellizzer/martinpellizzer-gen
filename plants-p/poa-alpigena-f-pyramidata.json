    "intro": "Poa alpigena f. pyramidata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
