    "intro": "Pleuropetalum darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's pleuropetalum, is a rare and striking member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and dark green, and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
