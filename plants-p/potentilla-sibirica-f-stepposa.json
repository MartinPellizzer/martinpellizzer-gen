    "intro": "Potentilla sibirica f. stepposa, commonly known as the steppe potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in arid climates."
