    "intro": "Psychotria wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It often grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests. Psychotria wrightii is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, though it is not as widely studied as other species in the genus."
