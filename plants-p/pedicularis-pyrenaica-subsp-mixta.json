    "intro": "Pedicularis pyrenaica subsp. mixta, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
