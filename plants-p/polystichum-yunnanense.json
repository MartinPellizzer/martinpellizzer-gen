    "intro": "Polystichum yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Polystichum yunnanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
