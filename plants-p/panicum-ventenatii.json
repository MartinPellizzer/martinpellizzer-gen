    "intro": "Panicum ventenatii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and tall, erect growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, white to grayish seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps contribute to its ecological and horticultural value."
