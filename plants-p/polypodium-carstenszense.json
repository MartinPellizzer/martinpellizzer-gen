    "intro": "Polypodium carstenszense, commonly known as the Carstensz fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often covered in dense, soft hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
