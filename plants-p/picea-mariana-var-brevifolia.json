    "intro": "Picea mariana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to northern North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense shoots. The needles are dark green, stiff, and have a slightly resinous scent. It typically grows in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
