    "intro": "Pinalia biophylla, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its leaves emit a soft blue glow at night, a trait attributed to specialized chloroplasts containing luciferin. The plant's root system is highly adapted to nutrient-poor soils, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rare habitat and fragile nature, Pinalia biophylla is considered an endangered species."
