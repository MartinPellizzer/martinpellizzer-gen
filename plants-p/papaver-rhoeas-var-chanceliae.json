    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. chanceliae, commonly known as the Chancel's poppy, is a variant of the common poppy, characterized by its striking red petals and a distinctive, narrow corolla. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include capsule fruits that release seeds through a longitudinal slit, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to other Papaver species and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
