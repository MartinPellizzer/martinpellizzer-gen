    "intro": "Piper multinodum, commonly known as the nodding pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has mild peppery flavors in its leaves, making it useful in some traditional cuisines. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
