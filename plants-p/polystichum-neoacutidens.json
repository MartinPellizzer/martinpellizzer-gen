    "intro": "Polystichum neoacutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are tightly clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Polystichum neoacutidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
