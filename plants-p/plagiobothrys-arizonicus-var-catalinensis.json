    "intro": "Plagiobothrys arizonicus var. catalinensis, commonly known as Catalina filaree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Catalina in California. It is a small, herbaceous annual that produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has thin, hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
