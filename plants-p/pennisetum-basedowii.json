    "intro": "Pennisetum basedowii, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, purple-tinted plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contrasts with the vibrant purple inflorescences. Pennisetum basedowii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal and drought tolerance."
