    "intro": "Paxiodendron usambarense var. serratifolia, commonly known as the Usambara cedar, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy, with leaves that are alternate and narrowly elliptic. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation to its mountainous habitat, including a thick bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, this species is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
