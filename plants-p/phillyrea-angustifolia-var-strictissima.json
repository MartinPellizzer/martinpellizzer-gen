    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. strictissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. This variety is noted for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in coastal and urban environments."
