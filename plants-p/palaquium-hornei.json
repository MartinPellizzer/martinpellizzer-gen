    "intro": "Palaquium hornei, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a hard, stony interior. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sweet, acidic flavor, while the seeds are often used in traditional medicine. Palaquium hornei is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
