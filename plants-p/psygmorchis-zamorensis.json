    "intro": "Psygmorchis zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Psygmorchis zamorensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
