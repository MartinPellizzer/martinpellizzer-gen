    "intro": "Pigea verbi-divini, commonly known as the divine word plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
