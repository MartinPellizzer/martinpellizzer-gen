    "intro": "Pterostylis decurva, commonly known as the long-spurred greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow floral structure with a long, slender spur. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-producing spur. Pterostylis decurva is a terrestrial orchid with a fibrous root system and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
