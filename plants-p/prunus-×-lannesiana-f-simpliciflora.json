    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. simpliciflora, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a horticultural form of the Prunus genus, characterized by its ornamental, double blooms. It is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Prunus lannesiana and other Prunus species, typically Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis. The plant is valued for its showy, clustered flowers that resemble small, intricate spheres, appearing in shades of white, pink, or red. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The foliage is dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display."
