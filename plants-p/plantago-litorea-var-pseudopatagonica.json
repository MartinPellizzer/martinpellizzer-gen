    "intro": "Plantago litorea var. pseudopatagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to coastal environments. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against salt spray and wind. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
