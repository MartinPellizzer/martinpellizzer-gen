    "intro": "Plantago achalensis var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Pakistan. It features a basal rosette of thick, hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional herbal practices for treating ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues."
