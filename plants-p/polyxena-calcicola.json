    "intro": "Polyxena calcicola, commonly known as the limestone rockrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcium-rich soils, often found on rocky slopes and limestone outcrops. Its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions makes it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Polyxena calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert wildlife."
