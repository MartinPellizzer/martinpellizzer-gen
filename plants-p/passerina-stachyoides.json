It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits. Its leaves are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Passerina stachyoides thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
