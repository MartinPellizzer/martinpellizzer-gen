    "intro": "Pothos giganteus, commonly known as the giant pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a variegated pattern of green and cream. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
