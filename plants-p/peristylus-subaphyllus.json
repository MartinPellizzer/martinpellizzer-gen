    "intro": "Peristylus subaphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peristylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem, giving it a compact appearance. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Peristylus subaphyllus is considered a species of conservation concern."
