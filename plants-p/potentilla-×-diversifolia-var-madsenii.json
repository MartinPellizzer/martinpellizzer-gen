    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 diversifolia var. madsenii, commonly known as the Madsen's potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. Its showy flowers, which range from yellow to orange, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
