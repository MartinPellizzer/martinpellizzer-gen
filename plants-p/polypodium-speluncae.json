    "intro": "Polypodium speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to life in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices. It thrives in low-light conditions and relies on moisture from the surrounding environment to survive. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically small and closely clustered. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are often found on the underside of the fronds. Due to its restricted habitat, Polypodium speluncae is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in subterranean ecosystems."
