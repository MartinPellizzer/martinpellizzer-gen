    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. stricta, commonly known as the dwarf cherry tree, is a compact variety of the Prunus mutabilis species. It is characterized by its small stature, making it ideal for small gardens or container planting. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which can transition to pink or red as the season progresses. Its leaves are dark green and provide a lush canopy, while its fruit is edible but typically not as large as the standard species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
