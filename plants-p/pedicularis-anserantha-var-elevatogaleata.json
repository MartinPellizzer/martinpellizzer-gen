    "intro": "Pedicularis anserantha var. elevatogaleata, commonly known as the Alpine Beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
