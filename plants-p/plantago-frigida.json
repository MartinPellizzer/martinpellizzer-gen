    "intro": "Plantago frigida, commonly known as the Arctic plantain, is a hardy perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant against extreme cold. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren environments. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
