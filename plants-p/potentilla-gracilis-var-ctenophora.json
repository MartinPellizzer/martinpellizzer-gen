    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. ctenophora, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval to lance-shaped leaflets, which are also covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
