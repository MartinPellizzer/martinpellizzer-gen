    "intro": "Potentilla anserina glabrata, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions."
