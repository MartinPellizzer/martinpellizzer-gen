It features glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
