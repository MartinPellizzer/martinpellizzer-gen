    "intro": "Polygonum rhizoxylon, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive node-bearing stems and often edible leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The rhizomes of Polygonum rhizoxylon are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
