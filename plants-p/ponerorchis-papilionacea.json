    "intro": "Ponerorchis papilionacea, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, India, and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, with a unique structure featuring a spurred lip. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
