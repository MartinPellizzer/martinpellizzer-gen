    "intro": "Pygeum sericeum var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked pygeum, is a rare variant of the pygeum species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, silky-hairless leaves and pale, smooth bark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. Its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
