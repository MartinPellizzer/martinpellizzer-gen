    "intro": "Patagonium mucronatum var. asperum, commonly known as the rough Patagonian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
