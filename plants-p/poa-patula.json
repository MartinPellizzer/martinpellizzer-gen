    "intro": "Poa patula, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and forms dense, sod-forming turf that is highly valued for lawns and sports fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and has rhizomes and stolons that help it spread and establish quickly. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to high levels of moisture and nutrients. Poa patula is also known for its ability to tolerate foot traffic and recover from damage, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
