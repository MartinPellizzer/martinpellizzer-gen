    "intro": "Poa glauca var. elatior, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Poa glauca var. elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous conditions."
