    "intro": "Peltispermum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or golden-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Peltispermum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They have fibrous roots and are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the genus is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
