    "intro": "Pyrus hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian pear, is a deciduous tree native to Hungary and parts of the Balkans. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a rounded crown with smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer and is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
