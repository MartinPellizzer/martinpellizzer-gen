    "intro": "Prunus palaeocerasus, commonly known as the ancient cherry, is an extinct species of Prunus native to the Paleogene period. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves, similar to its modern relatives. Fossil records suggest it thrived in temperate climates, likely in regions that are now part of Europe and Asia. The plant's fruits, though not well preserved, are believed to have been edible, possibly resembling small cherries. Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Prunus genus and ancient plant ecosystems."
