    "intro": "Pteris procera, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Pteris procera is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forests and along stream banks."
