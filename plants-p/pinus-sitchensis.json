    "intro": "Pinus sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southeast Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree can grow up to 60 meters in height and has a wide, spreading crown. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and resistance to rot, making it useful in construction and musical instrument making. The Sitka spruce plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
