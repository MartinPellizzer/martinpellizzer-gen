    "intro": "Prunus incisa f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered Japanese cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus incisa species, which is native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that appear in early spring, giving the tree a profusely flowering appearance. The flowers are typically pink or white, with petals that are longer and more numerous than those of the typical single-flowered variety. This ornamental tree is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
