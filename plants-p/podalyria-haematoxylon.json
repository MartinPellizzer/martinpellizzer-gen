    "intro": "Podalyria haematoxylon, commonly known as the Indian red sanders, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green. The plant is most notable for its heartwood, which is rich in a red dye called haematoxylon, used historically for coloring textiles and body paint. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
