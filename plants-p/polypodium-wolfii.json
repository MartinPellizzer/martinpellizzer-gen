    "intro": "Polypodium wolfii, commonly known as the wolf's foot fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium wolfii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
