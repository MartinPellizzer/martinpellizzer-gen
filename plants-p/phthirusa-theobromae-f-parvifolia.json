    "intro": "Phthirusa theobromae f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved form of the coffee berry beetle, is a variant of a plant species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, which is an adaptation that may enhance its survival in specific environmental conditions. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in association with coffee plants. Its botanical features include a woody stem, small elliptical leaves, and the production of small, spherical fruits. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological significance."
