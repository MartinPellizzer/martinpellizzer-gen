It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
