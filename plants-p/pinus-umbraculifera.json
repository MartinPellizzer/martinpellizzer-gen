    "intro": "Pinus umbraculifera, commonly known as the Umbrella Pine, is a rare and distinctive conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like crown formed by its dense, horizontal branches. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in fascicles of five. Its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its rarity and striking appearance."
