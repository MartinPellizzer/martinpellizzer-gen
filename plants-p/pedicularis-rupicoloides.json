It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Pedicularis rupicoloides is a perennial herb that blooms from June to August, contributing to the biodiversity of its high-altitude environment."
