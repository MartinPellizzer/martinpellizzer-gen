    "intro": "Panicum pergracile, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
