    "intro": "Polypodium falcatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, arching fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive linear shape resembling a sword. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
