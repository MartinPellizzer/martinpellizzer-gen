    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea glabella, commonly known as the purple-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark purple, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
