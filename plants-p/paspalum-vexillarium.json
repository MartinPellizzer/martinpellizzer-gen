    "intro": "Paspalum vexillarium, commonly known as the narrowleaf stargrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Paspalum vexillarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
