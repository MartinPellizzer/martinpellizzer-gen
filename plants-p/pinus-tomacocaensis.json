    "intro": "Pinus tomacocaensis, commonly known as the Tomacoca pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that contain seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the high-altitude environment and its role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
