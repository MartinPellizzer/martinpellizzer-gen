    "intro": "Psoralea subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual or perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
