It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
