    "intro": "Pandanus altissimus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving. Pandanus altissimus is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
