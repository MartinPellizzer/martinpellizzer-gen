    "intro": "Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana, commonly known as the tree of life or huisache, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green pods that contain edible seeds, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
