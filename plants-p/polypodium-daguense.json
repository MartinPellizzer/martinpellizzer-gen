    "intro": "Polypodium daguense, commonly known as the Daguense fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
