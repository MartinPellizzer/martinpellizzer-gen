    "intro": "Polypodium binervatum, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often arched or pendulous. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a network of roots that anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with distinct, parallel veins that give it its common name."
