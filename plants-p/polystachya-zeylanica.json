    "intro": "Polystachya zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Polystachya zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
