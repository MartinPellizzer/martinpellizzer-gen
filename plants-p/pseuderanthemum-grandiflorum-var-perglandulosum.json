    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum grandiflorum var. perglandulosum, commonly known as the silverleaf pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.
