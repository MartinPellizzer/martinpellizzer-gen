    "intro": "Puya macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's torch cactus, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and vibrant, red-orange inflorescences that resemble torches, blooming once in its lifetime. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Puya macbridei is considered a conservation concern."
