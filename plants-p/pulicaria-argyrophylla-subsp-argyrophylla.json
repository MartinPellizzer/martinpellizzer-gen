    "intro": "Pulicaria argyrophylla subsp. argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
