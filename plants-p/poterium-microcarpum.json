    "intro": "Poterium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited poterium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, rounded fruits called cypselae, which are typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Poterium microcarpum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and low moisture availability."
