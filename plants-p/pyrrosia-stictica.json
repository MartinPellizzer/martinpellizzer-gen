    "intro": "Pyrrosia stictica, commonly known as the stictic fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain attached to the substrate year-round. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Pyrrosia stictica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
