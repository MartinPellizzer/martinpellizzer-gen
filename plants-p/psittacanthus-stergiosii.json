    "intro": "Psittacanthus stergiosii, commonly known as the Stergios' cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, rosette-like pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in arid, rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
