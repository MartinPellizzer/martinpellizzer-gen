    "intro": "Plocama botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botchanzev's plocama, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
