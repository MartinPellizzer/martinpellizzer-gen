    "intro": "Picea pinsapo var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated Spanish fir, is a rare and unique variant of the Spanish fir. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features white and yellow markings on the needles. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. It is a coniferous evergreen tree with a conical shape and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
