    "intro": "Pleopeltis congregatifolia, commonly known as the clustered shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its leathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
