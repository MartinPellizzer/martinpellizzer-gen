    "intro": "Puya mariae, commonly known as the Marie's puya, is a striking South American plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces tall, inflorescences with vibrant red and yellow flowers, which bloom in the dry season. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Puya mariae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a rare and exotic species in horticulture."
