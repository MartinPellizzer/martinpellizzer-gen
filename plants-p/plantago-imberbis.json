    "intro": "Plantago imberbis, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the skin and respiratory system."
