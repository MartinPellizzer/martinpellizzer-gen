    "intro": "Pyrus tenuis, commonly known as the slender crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, yellow or red fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive form and seasonal interest. Pyrus tenuis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
