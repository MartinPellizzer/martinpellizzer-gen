    "intro": "Pyrus sinohimalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in the summer. Its fruits are similar in appearance to common pears but are often smaller and have a more intense flavor. This species is valued for its ornamental value and its contribution to local biodiversity."
