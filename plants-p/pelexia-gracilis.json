    "intro": "Pelexia gracilis, commonly known as the slender pelexia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
