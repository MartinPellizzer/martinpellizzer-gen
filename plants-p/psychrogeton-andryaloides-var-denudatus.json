    "intro": "Psychrogeton andryaloides var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked psychrogeton, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to cold climates, with its foliage often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against frost. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
