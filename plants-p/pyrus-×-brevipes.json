    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (common pear) and Pyrus pyraster (wild pear). It is a small, compact tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, making it suitable for small gardens and urban landscapes. The plant produces small, sweet, and edible fruits that are similar in taste to common pears but are often more delicate in texture. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide aesthetic value throughout the growing season. The dwarf pear is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal as well as its fruit."
