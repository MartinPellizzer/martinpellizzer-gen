It is characterized by its large, elliptical, and often broad leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
