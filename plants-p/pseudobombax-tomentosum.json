    "intro": "Pseudobombax tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the early morning. The tree produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky aril. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is often fluted and can grow to significant heights, making it a notable feature in its natural habitat."
