    "intro": "Polygala squamifolia, commonly known as the squamifoliate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a unique, spiral-shaped capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Polygala squamifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
