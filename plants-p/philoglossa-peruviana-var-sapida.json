    "intro": "Philoglossa peruviana var. sapida, commonly known as the Peruvian sweet fern, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are known for their aromatic properties and have been traditionally used in local herbal medicine. The varietal name 'sapida' refers to its distinctive, slightly sweet scent, which is more pronounced in certain environmental conditions."
