It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
