    "intro": "Pteris maxima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. Pteris maxima plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
