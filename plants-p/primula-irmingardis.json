    "intro": "Primula irmingardis, commonly known as the Irminger's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat.
