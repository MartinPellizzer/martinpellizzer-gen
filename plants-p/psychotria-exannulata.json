It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy appearance, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Psychotria exannulata is also notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties."
