    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. stellipila, commonly known as the starry cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval-shaped lobes, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountainous habitats."
