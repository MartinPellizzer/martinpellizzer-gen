    "intro": "Pellaea skinneri, commonly known as Skinner's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive black midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
