    "intro": "Pinus nesselrodiana, commonly known as the Nesselrode pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Andes in Ecuador. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
