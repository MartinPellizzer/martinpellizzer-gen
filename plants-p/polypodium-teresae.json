    "intro": "Polypodium teresae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium teresae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
