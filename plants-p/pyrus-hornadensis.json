    "intro": "Pyrus hornadensis, commonly known as the Horn\u00e1d apple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is a deciduous tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, characterized by its small, apple-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and has distinctive leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, followed by small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
