    "intro": "Papaver apokrinomenon, commonly known as the weeping poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that droop downward, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered a wild species in its native habitat."
