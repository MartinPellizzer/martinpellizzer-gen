    "intro": "Puya micrantha, commonly known as the Chilean torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous narrow, colorful bracts that resemble torches. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom sequentially along the inflorescence. Puya micrantha is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions with low precipitation. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
