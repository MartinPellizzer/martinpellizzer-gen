    "intro": "Polemonium grandiflorum var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow Jacob's ladder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. The plant's botanical name reflects its historical association with the genus Polemonium, which includes various flowering plants with similar morphological characteristics."
