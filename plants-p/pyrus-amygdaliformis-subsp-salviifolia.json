    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis subsp. salviifolia, commonly known as the Salvia-leaf pear, is a subspecies native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that resemble those of the salvia plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental foliage and historical use in local horticulture."
