    "intro": "Prosopis striata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, ridged stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in poor soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
