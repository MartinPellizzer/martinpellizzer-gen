    "intro": "Podachaenium chimalapanum, commonly known as the Chimalapan dwarf fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
