    "intro": "Potentilla dombeyi var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine gardens."
