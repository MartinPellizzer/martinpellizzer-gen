    "intro": "Plectritis capitata, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a single, compact head. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Plectritis capitata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
