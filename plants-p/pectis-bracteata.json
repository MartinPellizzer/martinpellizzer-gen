    "intro": "Pectis bracteata, commonly known as the lacecap plectritis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that consist of both showy ray flowers and smaller, inconspicuous disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its foliage is usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its native habitat."
