    "intro": "Psathyrostachys perennis, commonly known as the perennial wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, two-lobed florets. It is adapted to thrive in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardiness and potential for use in sustainable agriculture, it has gained attention as a forage and conservation species."
