    "intro": "Psilocaulon articulatum, commonly known as the segmented sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying coastal flora."
