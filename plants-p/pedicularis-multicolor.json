    "intro": "Pedicularis multicolor, commonly known as the rainbow lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, yellow, and white, often arranged in clusters. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
