It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small, lantern-like flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
