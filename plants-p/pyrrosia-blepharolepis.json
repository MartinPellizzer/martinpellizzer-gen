    "intro": "Pyrrosia blepharolepis, commonly known as the earleaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive ear-shaped lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture from the air. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
