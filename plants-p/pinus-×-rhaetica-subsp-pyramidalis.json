    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 rhaetica subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Swiss stone pine, is a subspecies of the European stone pine, characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo, and is native to the alpine regions of Europe. The tree has short, stout needles that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces edible seeds known as pine nuts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high altitudes in mountainous areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and for the production of its nutrient-rich seeds."
