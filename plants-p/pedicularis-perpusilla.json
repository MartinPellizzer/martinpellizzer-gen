    "intro": "Pedicularis perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Pacific Northwest in North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with two lips that resemble a monkey's face, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and forested areas at high elevations."
