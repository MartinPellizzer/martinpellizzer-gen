    "intro": "Physalis lanceolata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf huskfruit, is a variant of the common groundcherry. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of orange-yellow, inflated calyces that enclose small, edible berries. The berries are typically harvested when they turn a deep red, indicating maturity. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit."
