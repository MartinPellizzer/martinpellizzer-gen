    "intro": "Passerina ciliata, commonly known as the silky pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, early spring blooms. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that help it conserve moisture in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with numerous stamens and a prominent central pistil. Passerina ciliata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations."
