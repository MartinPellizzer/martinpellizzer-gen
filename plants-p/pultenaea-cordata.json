    "intro": "Pultenaea cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in heathlands and open woodlands. Pultenaea cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
