    "intro": "Poa tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Poa tianschanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
