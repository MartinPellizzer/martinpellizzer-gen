    "intro": "Panicum johannense, commonly known as Johann's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery panicles that produce small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often forms dense stands in its native environment. Panicum johannense is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
