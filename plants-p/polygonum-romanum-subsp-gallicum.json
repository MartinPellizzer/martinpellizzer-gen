    "intro": "Polygonum romanum subsp. gallicum, commonly known as French knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces tiny greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to spread rapidly."
