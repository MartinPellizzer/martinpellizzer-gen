    "intro": "Paullinia maritima, commonly known as the sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a slightly waxy texture. Paullinia maritima is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
