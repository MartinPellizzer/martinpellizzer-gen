    "intro": "Poa obtusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa obtusa is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
