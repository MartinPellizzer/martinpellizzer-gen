    "intro": "Pteris appendiculifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Pteris appendiculifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
