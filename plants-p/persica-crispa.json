    "intro": "Persica crispa, commonly known as the curly peach or crinkled peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange to red fruits resembling peaches but typically smaller and more tart. Persica crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
