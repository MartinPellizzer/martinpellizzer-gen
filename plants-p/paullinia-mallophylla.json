    "intro": "Paullinia mallophylla, commonly known as the Mallophylla poinsettia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the leaves of the poinsettia. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden beneath the showy bracts, and are pollinated by insects."
