    "intro": "Pisonia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can vary in shape and size depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous hairy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Pisonia heterophylla is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
