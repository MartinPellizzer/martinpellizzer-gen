    "intro": "Prenanthes javanica, commonly known as the Java water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant. Prenanthes javanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
