    "intro": "Phyllodoce linifolia, commonly known as dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Phyllodoce linifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
