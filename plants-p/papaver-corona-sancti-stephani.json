    "intro": "Papaver corona-sancti-stephani, commonly known as the Saint Stephen's Crown poppy, is a rare and striking botanical species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that resemble a crown, with a dark orange center and intricate, almost lace-like patterns. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanic collections."
