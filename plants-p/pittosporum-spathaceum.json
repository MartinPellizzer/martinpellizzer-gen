    "intro": "Pittosporum spathaceum, commonly known as the silver pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Pittosporum spathaceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
