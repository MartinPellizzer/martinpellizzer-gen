    "intro": "Pyrus aria subvar. obtusifolia, commonly known as the obtuseleaf pear, is a botanical variant of the pear species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, obtuse leaf shape and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and sweet. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in some horticultural gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
