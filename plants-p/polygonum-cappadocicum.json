It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
