    "intro": "Polygonum tenue var. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats."
