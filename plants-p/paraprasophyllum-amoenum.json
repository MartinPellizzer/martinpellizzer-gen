    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum amoenum, commonly known as the golden mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescence with elongated, lance-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
