    "intro": "Paraboea graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that help it ascend rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, adapted to thrive in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Paraboea graniticola is well-suited to environments with high light intensity and good drainage, making it a hardy species in its natural habitat."
