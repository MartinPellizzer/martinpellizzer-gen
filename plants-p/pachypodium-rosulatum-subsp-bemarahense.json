It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically small and deciduous, falling off during dry periods to reduce water loss. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
