    "intro": "Pseudosassafras tzumu, commonly known as Chinese pseudosassafras, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots contain compounds similar to those found in true sassafras, though it is not closely related. Pseudosassafras tzumu thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
