    "intro": "Pantlingia sikokiana, commonly known as the Zambian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rocky outcrops of Zambia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, unbranched stem and a single, broad ovate leaf. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rock surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
