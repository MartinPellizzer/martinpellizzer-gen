    "intro": "Polypodium catharinae f. auritum, commonly known as the auriculate polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often adorned with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizome is wiry and covered with fine roots, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat."
