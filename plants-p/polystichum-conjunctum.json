    "intro": "Polystichum conjunctum, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, leathery, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds."
