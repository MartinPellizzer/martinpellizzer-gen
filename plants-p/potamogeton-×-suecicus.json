It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow to deep water and is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Potamogeton \u00d7 suecicus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
