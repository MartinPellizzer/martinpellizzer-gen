    "intro": "Plantago pachyneura subsp. eupachyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems that bear alternate, lanceolate leaves with prominent midribs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, demonstrating adaptability to various environmental conditions."
