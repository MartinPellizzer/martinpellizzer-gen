    "intro": "Phyllanthus friesii, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it an important component of semi-arid ecosystems. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role contribute to its significance in both botanical study and local traditions."
