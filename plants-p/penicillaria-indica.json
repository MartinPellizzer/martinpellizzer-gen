    "intro": "Penicillaria indica, commonly known as the Indian penicillaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. Penicillaria indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
