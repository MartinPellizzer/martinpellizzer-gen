    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or pendula cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus cerasifera species, which is native to southern Europe and western Asia. This tree is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherry fruits that are smaller and less sweet than those of the common cherry. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
