It features slender, upright stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
