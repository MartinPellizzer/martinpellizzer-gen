    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled alpine cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are relatively small and tightly packed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is noted for its horticultural value in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
