    "intro": "Pterostylis arenicola, commonly known as the sandyland helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single leaf and a single, hooded flower that is usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its flowering period occurs during late summer to early autumn, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
