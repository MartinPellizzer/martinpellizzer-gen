    "intro": "Phacelia ramosissima var. cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a suitable candidate for xeriscaping."
