    "intro": "Pelozia laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance, hence its common name. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host. Pelozia laciniata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
