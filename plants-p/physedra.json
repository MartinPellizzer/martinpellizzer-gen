    "intro": "Physedra, commonly known as the common hound's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its dark purple or black, globe-shaped fruits that resemble a dog's tongue, hence its common name. The plant features a taproot system and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. Physedra typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores."
