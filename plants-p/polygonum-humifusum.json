    "intro": "Polygonum humifusum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. The plant features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface and a pointed tip. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer, producing small, three-lobed seeds."
