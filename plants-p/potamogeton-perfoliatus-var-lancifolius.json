    "intro": "Potamogeton perfoliatus var. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to water clarity and supporting biodiversity."
