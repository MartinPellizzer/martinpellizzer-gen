    "intro": "Phellandrium divaricatum var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating lemon myrtle, is a unique variant of the lemon myrtle species native to Australia. This plant is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that emit a strong, citral-rich fragrance. It is a semi-aquatic plant, often found growing in shallow water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties, often used in traditional Australian remedies and as a natural insect repellent."
