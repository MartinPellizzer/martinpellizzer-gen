    "intro": "Polygala senensis var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone polygala, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky outcrops and limestone formations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
