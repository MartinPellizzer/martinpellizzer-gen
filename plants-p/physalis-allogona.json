It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and bloom in the summer months. The fruit ripens in late summer and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
