    "intro": "Poinciana melanadenia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fiery red or orange-pink bract clusters that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by winged fruits, typical of the legume family. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its striking visual display. Its rapid growth and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
