    "intro": "Perdicium, commonly known as the red hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking red or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
