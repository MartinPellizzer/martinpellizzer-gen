    "intro": "Panicum commutatum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in its native range."
