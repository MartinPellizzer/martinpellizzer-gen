    "intro": "Pitcairnia fosteriana, commonly known as the Foster's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. Pitcairnia fosteriana is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
