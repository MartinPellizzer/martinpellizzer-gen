    "intro": "Penstemon palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Penstemon palmeri is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
