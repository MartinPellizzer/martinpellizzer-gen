    "intro": "Pavetta mufindiensis, commonly known as the Mufindi pavetta, is a shrub native to the high-altitude grasslands of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cooler, drier climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its ecosystem."
