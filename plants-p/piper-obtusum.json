    "intro": "Piper obtusum, commonly known as the bluntleaf pepper or bitter pepper, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a blunt tip, giving it its common name, and are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
