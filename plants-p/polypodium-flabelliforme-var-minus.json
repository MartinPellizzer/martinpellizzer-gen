    "intro": "Polypodium flabelliforme var. minus, commonly known as the lesser shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more delicate than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its fronds are divided into a series of small, lanceolate segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
