    "intro": "Pleopeltis viridis, commonly known as the green pleated fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, pleated fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to tree trunks or other surfaces. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
