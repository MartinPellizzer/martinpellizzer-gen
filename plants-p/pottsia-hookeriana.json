It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Pottsia hookeriana is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and historical significance in New Zealand's flora."
