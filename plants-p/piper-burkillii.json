    "intro": "Piper burkillii, commonly known as Burkill's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the pepper family."
