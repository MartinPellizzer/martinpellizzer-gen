    "intro": "Plantago sessiliflora, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive leaf shape that is heart-shaped at the base and gradually narrowing toward the tip. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the skin and respiratory system."
