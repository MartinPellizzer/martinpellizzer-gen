    "intro": "Prasophyllum stygium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands or open woodlands. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
