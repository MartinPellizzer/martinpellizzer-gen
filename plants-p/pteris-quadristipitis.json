    "intro": "Pteris quadristipitis, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense vegetation. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
