    "intro": "Peperomia humilis, commonly known as the low peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Central and South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia humilis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
