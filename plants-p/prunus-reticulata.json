    "intro": "Prunus reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese sand pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round pears that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. Prunus reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and historical significance."
