    "intro": "Poa curtifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Poa curtifolia is often found in grasslands and along the edges of wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
