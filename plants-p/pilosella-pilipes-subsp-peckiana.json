    "intro": "Pilosella pilipes subsp. peckiana, commonly known as the Peck's hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its hairy leaves and yellowish flowers are adaptations that aid in pollination and water conservation. It is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada."
