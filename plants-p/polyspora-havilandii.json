    "intro": "Polyspora havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polyspora havilandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
