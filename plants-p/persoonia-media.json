    "intro": "Persoonia media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghostpipe, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, often hairless leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped or urn-like flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Persoonia media is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
