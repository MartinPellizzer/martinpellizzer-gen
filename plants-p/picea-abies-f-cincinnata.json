    "intro": "Picea abies f. cincinnata, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a compact form of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, conical shape, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a decorative plant. The foliage is dark green, with short, stiff needles that provide year-round visual interest. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
