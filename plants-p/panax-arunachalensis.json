    "intro": "Panax arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal ginseng, is a rare species of plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It belongs to the genus Panax, which includes other well-known ginseng species, and is characterized by its perennial herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with a fibrous root system and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
