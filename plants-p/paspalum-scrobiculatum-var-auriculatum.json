    "intro": "Paspalum scrobiculatum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the golden paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
