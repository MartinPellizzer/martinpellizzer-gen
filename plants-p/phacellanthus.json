    "intro": "Phacellanthus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. Phacellanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh, drought-prone conditions."
