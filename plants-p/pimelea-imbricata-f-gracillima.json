It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in late winter to spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs."
