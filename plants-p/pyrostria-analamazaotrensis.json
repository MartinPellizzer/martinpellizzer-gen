It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has a rosette growth pattern, with spiny leaves that protect it from herbivores. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
