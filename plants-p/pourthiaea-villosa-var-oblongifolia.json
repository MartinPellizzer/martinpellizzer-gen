    "intro": "Pourthiaea villosa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the hairy pourthiaea, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oblong and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Pourthiaea, which are often found in rocky or grassland habitats."
