    "intro": "Platyrhodon, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate floral structures and are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats. Platyrhodons are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. Their flowers are usually small but colorful, with specialized shapes that aid in pollination by specific insects. The genus includes several species, each with distinct morphological features adapted to their specific ecological niches."
