It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small lanterns, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Pancratium narcissiflorum is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
