    "intro": "Polyplethia parvior, commonly known as the small-leaved polyplethia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small capsule that contains several seeds, and it is typically found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
