    "intro": "Poa kirkii var. dipsacea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted shoots and fine, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
