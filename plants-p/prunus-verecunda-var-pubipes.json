    "intro": "Prunus verecunda var. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and coastal areas. The pubescent variety is distinguished by its dense, fuzzy pubescence on the stems and leaves, contributing to its unique appearance."
