It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, edible cherries that are often used in local cuisine. Prunus ramburii thrives in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region."
