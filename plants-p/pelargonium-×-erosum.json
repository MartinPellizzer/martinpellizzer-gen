    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 erosum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to South Africa and is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and flowers. Pelargonium \u00d7 erosum thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
