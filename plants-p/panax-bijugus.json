    "intro": "Panax bijugus, commonly known as the two-lobed ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and fleshy, yellowish root system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a slow growth rate, making it highly susceptible to habitat loss. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both traditional medicine and conservation efforts."
