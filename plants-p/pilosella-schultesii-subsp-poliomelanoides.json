    "intro": "Pilosella schultesii subsp. poliomelanoides, commonly known as the whitehead sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
