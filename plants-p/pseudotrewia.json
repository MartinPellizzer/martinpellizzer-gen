    "intro": "Pseudotrewia, commonly known as the false treewillow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their alternate, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. Pseudotrewia species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. These plants are adapted to various soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
