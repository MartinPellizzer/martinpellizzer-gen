    "intro": "Podanthum linifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf podanthum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes collected for horticultural purposes, which can threaten its natural populations."
