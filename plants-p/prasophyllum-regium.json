    "intro": "Prasophyllum regium, commonly known as the royal leek, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers that resemble leeks. The plant thrives in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats, often in areas with poor drainage. Prasophyllum regium is a perennial herb that produces showy inflorescences, which are particularly visible during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
