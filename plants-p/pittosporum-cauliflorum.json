    "intro": "Pittosporum cauliflorum, commonly known as the cauliflower pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is known for its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and sometimes fruits develop directly on the stems rather than the branches. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Pittosporum cauliflorum is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its adaptability to various soil types."
