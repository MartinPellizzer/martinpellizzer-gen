It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
