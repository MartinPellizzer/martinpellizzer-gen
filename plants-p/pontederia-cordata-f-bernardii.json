    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. bernardii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas, typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features showy, spike-like inflorescences with lavender to blue flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves float on the surface. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in ponds and water gardens."
