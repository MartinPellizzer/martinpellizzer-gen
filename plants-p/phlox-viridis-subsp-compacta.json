It features dense clusters of small, bright green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has upright, branching stems covered with fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
