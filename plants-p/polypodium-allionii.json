    "intro": "Polypodium allionii, commonly known as the allion's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's botanical features make it a unique and valuable component of its native ecosystems."
