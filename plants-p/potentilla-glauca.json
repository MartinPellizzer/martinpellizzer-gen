    "intro": "Potentilla glauca, commonly known as white cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. It has a compact growth habit with upright stems and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Potentilla glauca is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
