It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, elongated spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in montane or alpine environments. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a serrated or lobed margin. Pellaea longimucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
