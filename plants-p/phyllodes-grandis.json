    "intro": "Phyllodes grandis, commonly known as the large-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its long, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the inland regions of Australia."
