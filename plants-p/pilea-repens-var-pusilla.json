    "intro": "Pilea repens var. pusilla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or coin plant, is a compact, trailing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to cascade beautifully from hanging baskets or shelves."
