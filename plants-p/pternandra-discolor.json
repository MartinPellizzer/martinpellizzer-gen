    "intro": "Pternandra discolor, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in pendulous clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a versatile ornamental and shade tree. Its ability to tolerate drought and urban conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warmer climates."
