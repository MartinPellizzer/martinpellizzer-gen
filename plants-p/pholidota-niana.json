It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Pholidota niana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
