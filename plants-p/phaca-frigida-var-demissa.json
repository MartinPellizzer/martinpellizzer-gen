    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. demissa, commonly known as the cold mountain phaca, is a variant of the phaca plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
