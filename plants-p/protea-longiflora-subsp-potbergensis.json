    "intro": "Protea longiflora subsp. potbergensis, commonly known as the Potberg protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a cylindrical shape. The plant is native to the Western Cape Province and thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of fynbos vegetation. Its floral structure includes a central stem with a dense cluster of stamens and a single pistil, typical of the genus Protea. The species is adapted to fire-prone environments, with a lignotuber allowing it to resprout after burning."
