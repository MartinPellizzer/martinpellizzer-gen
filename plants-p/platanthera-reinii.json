    "intro": "Platanthera reinii, commonly known as the Rein's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, slender stems that bear a striking arrangement of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered threatened in many regions."
