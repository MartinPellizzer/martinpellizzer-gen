    "intro": "Protocyrtandra todaiensis, commonly known as the Todai Island cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Todai in Japan. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Protocyrtandra todaiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
