    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica var. typica, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
