    "intro": "Peridium ovale, commonly known as the oval peridium, is a unique botanical structure found in certain fungal spore capsules. It is characterized by its oval shape and smooth, often waxy surface, which aids in spore dispersal. The peridium ovale is typically composed of a thick, multilayered cell wall that provides structural integrity. It serves as a protective casing for the spores inside, shielding them from environmental stressors. This structure is crucial for the reproductive cycle of the associated fungus."
