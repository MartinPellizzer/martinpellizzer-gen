    "intro": "Populus valida, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its wide distribution. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing ridges and furrows as it matures. Populus valida is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
