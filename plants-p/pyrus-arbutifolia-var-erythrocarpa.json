    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spring, followed by distinctive red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
