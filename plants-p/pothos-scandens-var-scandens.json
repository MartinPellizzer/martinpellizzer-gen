    "intro": "Pothos scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping pothos, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a slightly variegated pattern in some cultivars. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is highly adaptable to various indoor environments. Its ability to climb and trail makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shelf displays."
