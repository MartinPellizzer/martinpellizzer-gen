    "intro": "Poa tibeticola, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control in mountainous areas."
