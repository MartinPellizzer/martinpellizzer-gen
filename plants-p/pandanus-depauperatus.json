    "intro": "Pandanus depauperatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters around a central stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which develop into fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts due to its durable leaves. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical climates."
