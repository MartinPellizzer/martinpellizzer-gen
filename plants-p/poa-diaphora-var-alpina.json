    "intro": "Poa diaphora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-gray florets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize rocky or barren terrain. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
