    "intro": "Pedicularis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and its basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
