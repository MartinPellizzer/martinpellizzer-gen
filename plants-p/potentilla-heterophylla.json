    "intro": "Potentilla heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either basal or alternate, often changing shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
