    "intro": "Potentilla incana, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Potentilla incana is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for garden use and ecological restoration projects."
