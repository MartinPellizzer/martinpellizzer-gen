    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurisetus subsp. aurilanatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, globular stem that often develops a distinctive white or pale coloration. The plant features spiny areoles with clusters of white or pale bristles, giving it a unique appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
