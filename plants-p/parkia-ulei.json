    "intro": "Parkia ulei, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tropical legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its durability, the wood is used for construction and furniture, while the seeds are a food source for wildlife."
