    "intro": "Podocarpus canaliculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in many subtropical and tropical gardens."
