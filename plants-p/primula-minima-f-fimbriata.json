    "intro": "Primula minima f. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-leaved primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a distinctive fringed margin that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
