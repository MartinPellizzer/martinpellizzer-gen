    "intro": "Polypodium rude, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, rough, spiny structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium rude produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season."
