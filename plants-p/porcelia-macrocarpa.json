    "intro": "Porcelia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited porcelia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. Porcelia macrocarpa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting habits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and partial shade."
