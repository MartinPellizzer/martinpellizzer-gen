    "intro": "Potentilla ornithopoda var. tenella, commonly known as the silver-leaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety 'tenella' is distinguished by its more pronounced silver foliage compared to the typical form of Potentilla ornithopoda."
