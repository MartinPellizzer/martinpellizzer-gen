    "intro": "Prunus makinoensis, commonly known as the Makino cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, which are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Prunus makinoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade to full sun, making it adaptable to various garden settings."
