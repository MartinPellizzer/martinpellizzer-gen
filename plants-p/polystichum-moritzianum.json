    "intro": "Polystichum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum moritzianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
