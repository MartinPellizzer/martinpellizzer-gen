    "intro": "Prunus communis rusticana, commonly known as the wild cherry tree, is a deciduous species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, grey bark that develops fissures with age. The tree produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant has a long history of use in both ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
