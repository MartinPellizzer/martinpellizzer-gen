    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii var. oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan hemlock, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Madre del Sur in southern Mexico. It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae) and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
