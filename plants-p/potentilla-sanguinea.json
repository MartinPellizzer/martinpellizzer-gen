    "intro": "Potentilla sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodtwig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems that become more pronounced in winter, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, often turning yellow in the autumn. Potentilla sanguinea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
