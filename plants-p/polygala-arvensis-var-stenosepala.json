    "intro": "Polygala arvensis var. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender stems with opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive, often yellow or greenish petals. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in association with other drought-tolerant flora. The species is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in supporting local insect populations."
