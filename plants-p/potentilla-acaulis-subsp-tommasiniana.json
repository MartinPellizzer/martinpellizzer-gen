    "intro": "Potentilla acaulis subsp. tommasiniana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, round fruits known as achenes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
