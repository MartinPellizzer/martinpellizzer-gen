    "intro": "Polypodium breve, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Polypodium breve is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to low-light conditions."
