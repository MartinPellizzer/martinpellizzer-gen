    "intro": "Puccinellia macra, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. Puccinellia macra plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
