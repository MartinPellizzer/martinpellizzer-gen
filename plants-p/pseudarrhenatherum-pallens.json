    "intro": "Pseudarrhenatherum pallens, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Pseudarrhenatherum pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
