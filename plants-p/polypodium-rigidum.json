    "intro": "Polypodium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, forming dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in rocky habitats. The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a distinctive appearance."
