    "intro": "Pachycarpus bisacculatus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a feature typical of plants adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by orange or red fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
