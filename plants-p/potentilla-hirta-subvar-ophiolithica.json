    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subvar. ophiolithica, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or arctic environments. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in alternate fashion, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
