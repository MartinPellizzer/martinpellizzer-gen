It is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Perotriche species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant floral displays and ease of cultivation."
