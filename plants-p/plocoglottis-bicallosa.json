    "intro": "Plocoglottis bicallosa, commonly known as the hairy plocoglottis, is a rare and unique fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
