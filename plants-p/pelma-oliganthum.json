    "intro": "Pelma oliganthum, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has adapted to extreme conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its roots are highly specialized to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelma oliganthum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
