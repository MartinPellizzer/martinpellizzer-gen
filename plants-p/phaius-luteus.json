It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture."
