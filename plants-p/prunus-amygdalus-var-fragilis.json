    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. fragilis, commonly known as the wild almond or peach almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by fruits that are drupes with a hairy exterior. The seeds, or almonds, are encased in a hard shell and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
