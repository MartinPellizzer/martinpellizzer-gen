    "intro": "Pedicularis lalesarensis, commonly known as the Lalesarensis lousewort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
