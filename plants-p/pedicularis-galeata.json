    "intro": "Pedicularis galeata, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
