    "intro": "Pernettya quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Pernettya quadrifida is a hardy species adapted to extreme climates, making it an important component of polar ecosystems."
