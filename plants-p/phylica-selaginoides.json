    "intro": "Phylica selaginoides, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped stems and bright red or orange floral spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
