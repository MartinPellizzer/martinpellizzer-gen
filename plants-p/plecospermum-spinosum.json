    "intro": "Plecospermum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny plecospermum, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
