    "intro": "Plantago africana, commonly known as African plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem bearing small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike. Its seeds are enclosed in a papery capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
