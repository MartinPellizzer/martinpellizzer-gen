It features tall, arching clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a vibrant purple hue in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes that add visual interest during the winter months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and butterflies enhance its ecological value."
