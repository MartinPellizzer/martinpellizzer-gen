    "intro": "Poicillopsis mollis, commonly known as the soft moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks, and the spores are released in a single discharge. Poicillopsis mollis is an important component of many moss-dominated ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
