The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for studying plant resilience in dry climates."
