    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold, and its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, often with a dark throat. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cool climates. This variety is closely related to other Primula species, sharing similar growth habits and floral characteristics."
