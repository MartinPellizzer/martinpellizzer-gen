    "intro": "Pitcairnia goudae, commonly known as the Gouda pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is essential for its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its green foliage. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservatories. Pitcairnia goudae is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
