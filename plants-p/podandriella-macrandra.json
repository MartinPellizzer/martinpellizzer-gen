    "intro": "Podandriella macrandra, commonly known as the broad-fruited podandriella, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is characterized by its small, shrub-like growth habit and its unique, elongated, pod-like fruits that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
