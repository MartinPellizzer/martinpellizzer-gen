It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with a compact form and hairy stems. The botanical features of Podosemum tenuifolium make it an interesting subject for studies in tropical botany and plant morphology."
