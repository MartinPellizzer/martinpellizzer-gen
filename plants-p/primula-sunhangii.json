    "intro": "Primula sunhangii, commonly known as the Sunhang primrose, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features rosettes of broad, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains a relatively rare species in horticulture."
