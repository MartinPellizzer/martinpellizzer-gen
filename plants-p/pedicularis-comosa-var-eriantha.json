It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
