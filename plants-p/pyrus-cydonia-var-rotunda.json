    "intro": "Pyrus cydonia var. rotunda, commonly known as the nectarine tree, is a cultivar of the common pear that exhibits unique fruit characteristics. The fruits are typically round and have a smooth, glossy skin, often with a slight blush of color. This variety is prized for its sweet, juicy flesh and is commonly cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. The tree itself is a deciduous species that thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, which give way to the distinctive fruits later in the growing season."
