    "intro": "Panicum fatuum, commonly known as ghost grass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its common name is derived from its ethereal appearance and the way it seems to float on the surface of water. Despite its delicate look, it is a resilient species that plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
