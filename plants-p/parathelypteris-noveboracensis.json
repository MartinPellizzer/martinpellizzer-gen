    "intro": "Parathelypteris noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically divided into lance-shaped segments and are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This fern thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil."
