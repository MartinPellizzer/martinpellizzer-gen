    "intro": "Pappophorum gracile, commonly known as the slender pappus grass, is a small annual grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and sandy plains. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the leaves often curled at the edges. The plant's life cycle is adapted to arid conditions, making it resilient to drought and heat."
