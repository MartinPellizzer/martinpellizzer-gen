    "intro": "Plantago victorialis var. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and meadows. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. This species is valued for its medicinal properties, with leaves traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive issues."
