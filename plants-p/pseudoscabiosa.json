    "intro": "Pseudoscabiosa, commonly known as false scabiosa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that often resemble those of the true scabiosa species. Pseudoscabiosa species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or white, and they bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ease of care."
