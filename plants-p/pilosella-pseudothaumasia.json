It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the genus Pilosella. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often in open, sun-exposed areas. Pilosella pseudothaumasia is notable for its delicate appearance and its ability to withstand harsh mountainous environments."
