    "intro": "Picea abies var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches. This evergreen conifer features long, drooping shoots that give it a cascading, ethereal appearance. It retains its needle-like foliage year-round, providing ornamental value in both winter and summer. Native to the mountains of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Due to its unique form, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks as a decorative plant."
