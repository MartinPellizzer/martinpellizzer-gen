    "intro": "Polypodium revertens, commonly known as the false fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
