    "intro": "Phaeonychium parryoides, commonly known as the Parry's phaeonychium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a reddish tinge, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several U.S. states."
