    "intro": "Polianthes palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Polianthes palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
