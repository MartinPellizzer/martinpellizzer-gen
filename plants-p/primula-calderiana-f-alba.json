    "intro": "Primula calderiana f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered calderian primrose, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. This alpine plant is characterized by its pale to white, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of China. The plant features a short, hairy stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
