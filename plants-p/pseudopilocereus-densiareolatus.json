    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus densiareolatus, commonly known as the dense areola cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered with dense, white spines and areoles that are closely packed. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
