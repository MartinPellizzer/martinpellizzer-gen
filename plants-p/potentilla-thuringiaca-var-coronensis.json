    "intro": "Potentilla thuringiaca var. coronensis, commonly known as the silverweed or crown potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
