    "intro": "Papaver roemeria, commonly known as the Roemer's poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a dark red or purple blotch at the base. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. The seeds of Papaver roemeria are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution in its native range."
