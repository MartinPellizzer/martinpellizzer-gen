    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant features robust, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the peony family's evolutionary adaptations."
