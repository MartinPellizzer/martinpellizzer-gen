    "intro": "Pingraea marginalis, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Pingraea marginalis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
