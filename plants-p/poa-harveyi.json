    "intro": "Poa harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Harvey's bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
