    "intro": "Polystichum elegans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, arching fronds with a silvery-blue hue on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Polystichum elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
