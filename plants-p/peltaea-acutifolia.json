    "intro": "Peltaea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved peltaea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Peltaea acutifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
