    "intro": "Panicum claytonii, commonly known as Clayton's panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Panicum claytonii is typically found in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
