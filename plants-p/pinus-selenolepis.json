This coniferous tree is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-shaped structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant has adapted to harsh climatic conditions, showcasing resilience to cold and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
