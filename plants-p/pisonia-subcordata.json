    "intro": "Pisonia subcordata, commonly known as the red pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the western Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red, lantern-like flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a reddish or purple underside. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, hairy seeds. Pisonia subcordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
