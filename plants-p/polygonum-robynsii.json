    "intro": "Polygonum robynsii, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, hollow stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in non-native regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive spread, it is considered a significant ecological concern in many areas outside its native range."
