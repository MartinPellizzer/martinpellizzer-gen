    "intro": "Pelargonium semitrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
