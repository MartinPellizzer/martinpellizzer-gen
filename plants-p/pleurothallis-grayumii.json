    "intro": "Pleurothallis grayumii, commonly known as the Gray's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette, allowing it to capture moisture from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
