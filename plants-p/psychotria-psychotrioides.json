It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its habitat in dense, humid forests, it is often difficult to observe in the wild."
