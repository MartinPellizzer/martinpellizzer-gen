    "intro": "Puya eryngioides, commonly known as the Andean torchflower, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya eryngioides is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over a century."
