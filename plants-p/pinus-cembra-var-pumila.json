    "intro": "Pinus cembra var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf stone pine, is a rare and unique variant of the stone pine species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has short, stout needles and produces small, edible seeds that are often consumed by wildlife. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
