    "intro": "Polybotrya nutans, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Polybotrya nutans is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, exhibiting features similar to early land plants."
