    "intro": "Prismatocarpus lycopodioides var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on the stems, which gives it its common name."
