    "intro": "Pahudia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant lobelias, is a striking plant native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its arid environment. It grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Pahudia macrocarpa is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
