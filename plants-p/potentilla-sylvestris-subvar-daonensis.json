    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. daonensis, commonly known as the Daonensis cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
