    "intro": "Primula qinghaiensis, commonly known as the Qinghai primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Qinghai Lake region in China. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it adapts to cold and harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the local alpine ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
