    "intro": "Poa aquatica var. vivipara, commonly known as water grass or swamp grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy includes vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This characteristic allows it to spread efficiently in moist, nutrient-rich habitats."
