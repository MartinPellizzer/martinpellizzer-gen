    "intro": "Polycnemum majus var. humilius, commonly known as the dwarf bladderworts, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and distinctive bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It has a short stature, often growing no taller than a few centimeters, and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The species is known for its specialized adaptations for carnivory, which help it obtain essential nutrients in its challenging habitat."
