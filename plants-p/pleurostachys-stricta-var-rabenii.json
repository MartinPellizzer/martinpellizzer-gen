    "intro": "Pleurostachys stricta var. rabenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of the stem, which are followed by blue or purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
