    "intro": "Phyllanthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a prostrate or\u530d\u5310 (creeping) manner along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule containing minute seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Phyllanthus prostratus has a somewhat spiny appearance due to its glandular hairs, which can deter herbivores."
