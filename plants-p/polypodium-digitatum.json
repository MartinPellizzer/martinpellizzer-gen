    "intro": "Polypodium digitatum, commonly known as the Chinese ladder fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a ladder, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
