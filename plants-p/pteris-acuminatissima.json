    "intro": "Pteris acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the forest floor or water surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. Pteris acuminatissima is often found in wetlands, streams, and along the edges of ponds."
