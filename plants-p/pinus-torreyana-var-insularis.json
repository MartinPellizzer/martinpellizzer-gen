    "intro": "Pinus torreyana var. insularis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz Island pine, is a rare and endemic species native to Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands of California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, upward-curving needles and small, egg-shaped cones. The tree typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, adapted to the region's mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its limited distribution and unique ecological role make it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in local ecosystems."
