It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue along the veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Pteris venusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
