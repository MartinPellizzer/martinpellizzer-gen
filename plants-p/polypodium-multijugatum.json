    "intro": "Polypodium multijugatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium multijugatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
