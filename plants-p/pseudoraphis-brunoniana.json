    "intro": "Pseudoraphis brunoniana, commonly known as the golden grass or desert fan grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, fan-shaped clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in late spring, which are arranged in loose, panicle-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental use in dry landscapes."
