    "intro": "Plectronia graniticola, commonly known as the granitic rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like organism is often found growing on granite and other acidic rocks in arid or semi-arid regions. Its structure is typically crust-like, forming a thin, layered coating on the surface of its substrate. Plectronia graniticola plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in rocky ecosystems."
