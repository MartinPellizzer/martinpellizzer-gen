It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
