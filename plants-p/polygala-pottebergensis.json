    "intro": "Polygala pottebergensis, commonly known as the Potteberg milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
