    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 puberula, commonly known as the hybrid primrose, is a flowering plant in the Primulaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Primula vulgaris and Primula veris, combining traits from both parent species. The plant typically produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
