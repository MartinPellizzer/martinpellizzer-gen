    "intro": "Parietaria judaica, commonly known as the Jewish wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that typically thrives in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It is often found growing along walls, in cracks, and in dry, sunny locations. Parietaria judaica is also known for its allergenic properties, as it can cause skin irritation and respiratory issues in some individuals."
