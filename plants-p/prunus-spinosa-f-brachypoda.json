    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorny stems and dark, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, black berries in late summer, which are edible but have a tart, slightly bitter flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
