    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 zizii f. foliosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant is rooted in the substrate and has long, flexible stems that often float on the water surface. Its small, green flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and are pollinated by wind. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates."
