    "intro": "Philadelphus serpyllifolius, commonly known as meadow gold or golden spirea, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
