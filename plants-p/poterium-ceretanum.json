    "intro": "Poterium ceretanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Poterium ceretanum is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
