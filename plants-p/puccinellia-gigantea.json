    "intro": "Puccinellia gigantea, commonly known as giant puccinellia, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Puccinellia gigantea is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
