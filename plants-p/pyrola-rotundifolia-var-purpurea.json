    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features broad, rounded leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year, providing a dense ground cover in shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves and flowers contain aromatic compounds, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in acidic, moist soils. Pyrola rotundifolia var. purpurea is often found in coniferous or mixed hardwood forests, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
