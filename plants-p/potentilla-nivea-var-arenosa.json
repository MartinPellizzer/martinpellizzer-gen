    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. arenosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
