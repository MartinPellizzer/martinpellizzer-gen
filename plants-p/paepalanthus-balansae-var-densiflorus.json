It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy bracts that display vibrant colors, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
