    "intro": "Pirinia, commonly known as the bluebell or hare's-foot, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Pirinia species typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and sometimes used in traditional medicine. They are native to regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant's unique floral structure and fragrance make it a notable presence in woodland ecosystems."
