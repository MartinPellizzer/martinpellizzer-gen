    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus lissocarpus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pyrrhocactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
