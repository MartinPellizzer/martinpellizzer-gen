    "intro": "Plantago asiatica, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and are also edible, though they can be slightly bitter."
