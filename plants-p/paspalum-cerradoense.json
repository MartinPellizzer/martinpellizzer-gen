    "intro": "Paspalum cerradoense, commonly known as the cerrado grass, is a perennial grass native to the Cerrado biome of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils and seasonal droughts of the cerrado ecosystem. Paspalum cerradoense plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
