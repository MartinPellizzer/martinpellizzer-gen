    "intro": "Populus deglubata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. Populus deglubata prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a temperate climate."
