    "intro": "Poa sudicola, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Poa sudicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
