It features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear-shaped berry that ripens in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
