    "intro": "Polystichum californicum, commonly known as the California holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and have a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum californicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
