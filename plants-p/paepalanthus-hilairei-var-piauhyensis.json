    "intro": "Paepalanthus hilairei var. piauhyensis, commonly known as the Piauhy palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and elongated, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments, often found in the Piau\u00ed region of northeastern Brazil. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
