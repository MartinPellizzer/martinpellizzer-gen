    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate sowthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
