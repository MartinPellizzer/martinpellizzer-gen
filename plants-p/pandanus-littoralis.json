    "intro": "Pandanus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, often growing in saltwater environments. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for making thatch, while its fruit is edible and contains a starchy, sweet pulp. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
