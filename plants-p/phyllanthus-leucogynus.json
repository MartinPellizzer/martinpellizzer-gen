It belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
