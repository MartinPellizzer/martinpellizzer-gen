    "intro": "Psychotria tetragonopus, commonly known as the \"arrow poison plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its historical use in traditional practices. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been studied for potential medicinal and recreational applications."
