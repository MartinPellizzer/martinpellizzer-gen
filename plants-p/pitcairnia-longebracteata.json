    "intro": "Pitcairnia longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bract pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
