    "intro": "Poa interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native plant communities."
