    "intro": "Polygonum scandens, commonly known as the climbing smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb and trail along the ground or over other vegetation. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum scandens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions."
