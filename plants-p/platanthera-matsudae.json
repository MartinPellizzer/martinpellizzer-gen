    "intro": "Platanthera matsudae, commonly known as the Matsudae's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges."
