It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Parrya albida typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
