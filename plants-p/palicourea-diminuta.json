    "intro": "Palicourea diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf palicourea, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
