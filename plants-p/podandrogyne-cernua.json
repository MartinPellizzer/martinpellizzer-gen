    "intro": "Podandrogyne cernua, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area. Podandrogyne cernua is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
