    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. athroostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. It has a low-growing, mat-forming structure that makes it suitable for ground cover. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed florets."
