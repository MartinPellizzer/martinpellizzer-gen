    "intro": "Phoradendron pergranulatum, commonly known as the granular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, clustered leaves and white or pale green berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, and it relies on birds for seed dispersal. The species is characterized by its granular texture on the stems and its ecological role as both a parasite and a food source for various wildlife."
