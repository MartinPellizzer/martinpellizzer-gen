It is characterized by its large, glossy dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are enclosed within the pods and are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. Pouteria forbesii thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native region."
