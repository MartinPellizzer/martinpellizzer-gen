    "intro": "Polypodium rhizocaulon, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, creeping rhizome system that allows it to colonize rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are usually leathery and bipinnate, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in humid conditions and is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
