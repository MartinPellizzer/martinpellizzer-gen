    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium rebmanii, commonly known as Rebman's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its common name comes from its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods after flowering, resembling an everlasting flower."
