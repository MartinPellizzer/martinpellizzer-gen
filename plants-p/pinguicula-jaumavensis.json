    "intro": "Pinguicula jaumavensis, commonly known as the Jaumave butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is a small, terrestrial plant that produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution."
