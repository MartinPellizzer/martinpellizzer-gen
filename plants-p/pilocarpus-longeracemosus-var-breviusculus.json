It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine for its stimulant and antispasmodic effects."
