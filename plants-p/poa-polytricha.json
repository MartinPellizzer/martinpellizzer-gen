    "intro": "Poa polytricha, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, slender blades that often form a dense mat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa polytricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes due to its durability and adaptability."
