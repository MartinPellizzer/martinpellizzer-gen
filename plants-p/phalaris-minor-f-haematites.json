    "intro": "Phalaris minor f. haematites, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or purple inflorescences, which contrast with its fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ornamental plant in mixed borders. Phalaris minor f. haematites is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
