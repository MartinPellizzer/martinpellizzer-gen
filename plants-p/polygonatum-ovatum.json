    "intro": "Polygonatum ovatum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features tall, arching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and unique flowering display."
