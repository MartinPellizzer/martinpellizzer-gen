    "intro": "Phaseolus juruanus, commonly known as the Jurua bean, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is a climbing legume that produces small, yellow flowers and elongated, slender pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a robust root system that helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-rich soil. This species is valued for its nutritional content and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for food and medicinal purposes."
