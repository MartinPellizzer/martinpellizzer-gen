    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that ripen in the fall. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Ptelea trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
