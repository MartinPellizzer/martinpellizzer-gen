    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. batjanense, commonly known as the Batjan's sword fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
