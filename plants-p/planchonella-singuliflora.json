    "intro": "Planchonella singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered planchonella, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spherical fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
