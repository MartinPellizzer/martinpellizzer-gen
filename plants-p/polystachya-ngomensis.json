    "intro": "Polystachya ngomensis, commonly known as the Ngomeni torchstick, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
