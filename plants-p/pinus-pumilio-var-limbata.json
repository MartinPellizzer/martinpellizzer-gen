    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. limbata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine or the alpine pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine. It is a small evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical whitebark pine. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. This variety is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
