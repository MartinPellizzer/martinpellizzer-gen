    "intro": "Pedicularis palustris var. semirosea, commonly known as the pale lady's slipper, is a herbaceous perennial native to wet, boggy habitats in northern regions. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant has a short, hairy stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This variant is distinguished by its lighter coloration and slightly smaller flowers compared to other varieties of Pedicularis."
