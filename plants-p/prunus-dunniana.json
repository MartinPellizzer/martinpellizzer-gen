    "intro": "Prunus dunniana, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Prunus dunniana is valued for its spring blossoms and adaptability to various soil types."
