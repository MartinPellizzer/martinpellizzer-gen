    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. incisoides, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom variant with incised leaves, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the emergence of its serrated, ovate leaves. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other cherry species, such as Prunus serrulata. Its foliage is distinctive for its finely toothed margins, which set it apart from typical cherry blossoms. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and public spaces due to its aesthetic appeal."
