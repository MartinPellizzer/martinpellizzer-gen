    "intro": "Phegopteris lastreoides, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The rock polypody is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
