    "intro": "Ponerorchis taitungensis var. alboflorens, commonly known as the white-flowered taitung orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which contrast with its greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornamental, with a delicate structure that enhances its aesthetic appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
