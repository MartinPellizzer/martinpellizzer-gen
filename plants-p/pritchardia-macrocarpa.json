    "intro": "Pritchardia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant poinciana, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest palms in the region. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers in clusters, which are followed by large, woody fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
