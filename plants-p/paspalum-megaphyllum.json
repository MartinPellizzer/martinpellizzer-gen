    "intro": "Paspalum megaphyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf grass or giant paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
