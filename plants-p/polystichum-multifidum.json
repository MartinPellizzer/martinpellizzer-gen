    "intro": "Polystichum multifidum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
