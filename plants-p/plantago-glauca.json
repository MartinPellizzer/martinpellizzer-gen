    "intro": "Plantago glauca, commonly known as blue plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces erect flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged capsules, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
