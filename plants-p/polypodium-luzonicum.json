    "intro": "Polypodium luzonicum, commonly known as the Luzon holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
