    "intro": "Polypodium rigidulum var. vidgenii, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are leathery and have a distinctive, stiff, and rigid appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the Polypodiaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
