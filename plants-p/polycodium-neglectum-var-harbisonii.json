    "intro": "Polycodium neglectum var. harbisonii, commonly known as Harbison's polycodium, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
