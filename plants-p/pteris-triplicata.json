    "intro": "Pteris triplicata, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats in suitable habitats. Pteris triplicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
