It features heart-shaped leaves that are elongated and narrow, with a glossy green surface. The plant has aerial roots that help it climb and anchor itself to supports. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
