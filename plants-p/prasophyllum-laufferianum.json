    "intro": "Prasophyllum laufferianum, commonly known as the Lauffer's leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils within woodland or heathland environments. The plant features a short, stocky stem with a single, narrow, grass-like leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a loose spike, often resembling a leek in appearance. Prasophyllum laufferianum is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
