    "intro": "Prestoea brachyclada, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red fruits containing three seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry. Due to overharvesting, it is now protected in many regions and is considered a valuable species for ecological and conservation purposes."
