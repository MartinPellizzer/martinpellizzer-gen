    "intro": "Pappostipa speciosa var. media, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It typically grows in open woodlands and meadows, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of awns. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
