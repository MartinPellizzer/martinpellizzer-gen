    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its unique feature is the presence of viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments."
