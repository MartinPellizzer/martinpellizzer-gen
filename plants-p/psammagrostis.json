    "intro": "Psammagrostis, commonly known as sand grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its adaptation to arid and sandy environments, with species often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Psammagrostis species are often used for dune stabilization due to their ability to thrive in harsh, wind-blown conditions. Their ecological importance lies in their role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
