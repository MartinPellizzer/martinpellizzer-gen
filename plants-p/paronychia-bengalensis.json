    "intro": "Paronychia bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal bladder nut, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, leaf-like structures that resemble small bladders. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often enclosed in specialized cup-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are typically smooth and green. Paronychia bengalensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
