    "intro": "Penstemon aridus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, well-drained habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Penstemon aridus is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
