    "intro": "Pachycarpus spurius, commonly known as the spiny pachycarpus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its roots are shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
