    "intro": "Polypodium papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that resemble paper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators."
