    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically smooth and dark green, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, often visible near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing oxygen and shelter for various aquatic organisms. This variant is often found in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy bottoms."
