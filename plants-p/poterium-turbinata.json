It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Poterium turbinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
