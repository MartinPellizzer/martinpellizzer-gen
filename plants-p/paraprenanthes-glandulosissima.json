    "intro": "Paraprenanthes glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular paraprenanthes, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that give it its specific epithet \"glandulosissima,\" meaning \"very glandular.\" It produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a compact cluster, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
