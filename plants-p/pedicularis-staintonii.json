    "intro": "Pedicularis staintonii, commonly known as the Stainton's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
