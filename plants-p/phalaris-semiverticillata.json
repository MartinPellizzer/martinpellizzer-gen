    "intro": "Phalaris semiverticillata, commonly known as narrow-leaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, bract-like flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
