    "intro": "Potentilla lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are usually compound, with five leaflets, and it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Potentilla lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in tundra and subarctic ecosystems."
