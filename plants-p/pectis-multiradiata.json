It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Pectis multiradiata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
