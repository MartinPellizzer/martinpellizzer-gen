It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a competitive weed in various ecosystems."
