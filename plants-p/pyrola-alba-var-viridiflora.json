    "intro": "Pyrola alba var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered white snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white flowers with a subtle greenish tinge, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock outcrops, often growing in acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
