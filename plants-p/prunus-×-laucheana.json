    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 laucheana, commonly known as the Lauche cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus padus (bullace). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, dark red to black fruits that are edible but generally not as flavorful as other cherry varieties. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it flowers in early spring with clusters of white or pale pink blossoms. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
