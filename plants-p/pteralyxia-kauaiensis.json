It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
