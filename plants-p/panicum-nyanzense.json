    "intro": "Panicum nyanzense, commonly known as the East African millet, is a grass species native to East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. Due to its resilience and nutritional value, it has been used traditionally for both forage and human consumption in its native regions."
