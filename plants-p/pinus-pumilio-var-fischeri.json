    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's dwarf pine, is a variant of the Andean pine, native to the high Andes of South America. It is a small, slow-growing conifer with a distinctive compact form, often reaching heights of less than two meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, oval cones. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in mountainous ecosystems."
