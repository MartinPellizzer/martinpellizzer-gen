    "intro": "Pleopeltis adfinis, commonly known as the Adfinis fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The leaves are usually glossy and have a distinct, intricate venation pattern that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
