    "intro": "Plantago major var. dumanii, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered with fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
