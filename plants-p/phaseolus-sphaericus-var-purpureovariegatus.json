    "intro": "Phaseolus sphaericus var. purpureovariegatus, commonly known as the purple variegated kidney bean, is a cultivar of the kidney bean species characterized by its distinctive purplish and variegated leaf patterns. This variety is native to the Americas and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible beans. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with upright stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces kidney-shaped pods that mature to a dark brown color. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution, making it a unique addition to botanical collections."
