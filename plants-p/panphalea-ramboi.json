    "intro": "Panphalea ramboi, commonly known as the ramboi fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
