    "intro": "Primula nghialoensis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, broad, and slightly hairy, while its flowers are often pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primula nghialoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
