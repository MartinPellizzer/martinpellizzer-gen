It features slender, tufted inflorescences that produce fluffy, white or pale pink plumes, giving it a distinctive ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, making it suitable for use in gardens and as a landscape plant. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest. Pennisetum domingense thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
