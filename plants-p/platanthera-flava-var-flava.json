    "intro": "Platanthera flava var. flava, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America. This herbaceous perennial has a slender, leafless stem that bears two opposite leaves near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. The species is also noted for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
