It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and vertical spaces."
