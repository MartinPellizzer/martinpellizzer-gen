    "intro": "Polypodium discolor, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium discolor is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
