    "intro": "Pyrethrum tingitanum, commonly known as the Moroccan pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable source for organic pest control. Pyrethrum tingitanum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
