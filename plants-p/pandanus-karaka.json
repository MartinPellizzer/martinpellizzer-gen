    "intro": "Pandanus karaka, commonly known as the karaka palm, is a species native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Polynesia and Micronesia. It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and long, pinnate leaves that are often used for thatching and weaving. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, spiny fruits. Its leaves are characterized by their stiff, fibrous texture and are often used in traditional crafts. The karaka palm is well adapted to coastal and tropical environments, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions."
