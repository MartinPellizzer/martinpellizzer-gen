    "intro": "Phaeoneuron dicellandroides, commonly known as the two-celled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically flat and leafy, with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female reproductive structures on the same thallus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in studies of early land plant evolution."
