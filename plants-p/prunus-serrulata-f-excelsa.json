It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a broad, rounded crown. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and public parks, especially for its fleeting floral display."
