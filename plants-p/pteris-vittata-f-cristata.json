    "intro": "Pteris vittata f. cristata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive crinkled, frond-like leaves. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a unique, curled appearance that sets it apart from the standard form. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
