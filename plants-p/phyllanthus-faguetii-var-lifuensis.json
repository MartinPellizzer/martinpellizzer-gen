    "intro": "Phyllanthus faguetii var. lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifu mountain spurge, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
