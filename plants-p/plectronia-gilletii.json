    "intro": "Plectronia gilletii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Plectronia gilletii plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
