    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. cognata, commonly known as the three-leaf wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species has historical use in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
