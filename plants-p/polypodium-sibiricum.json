    "intro": "Polypodium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the cold climates of Asia, including regions of Russia, China, and Mongolia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Polypodium sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
