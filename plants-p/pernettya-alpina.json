    "intro": "Pernettya alpina, commonly known as the alpine cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and heathers, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Pernettya alpina thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
