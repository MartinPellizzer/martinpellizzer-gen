    "intro": "Pilea vermicularis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically round or oval in shape, often with a slightly curled edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Its compact growth habit and air-purifying qualities make it both ornamental and beneficial for indoor environments."
