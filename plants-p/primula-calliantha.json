    "intro": "Primula calliantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a notable early-flowering species in its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and the plant prefers well-drained, moist soils. Primula calliantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
