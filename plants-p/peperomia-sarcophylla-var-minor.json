    "intro": "Peperomia sarcophylla var. minor, commonly known as the miniature peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or purple tinge on the undersides. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
