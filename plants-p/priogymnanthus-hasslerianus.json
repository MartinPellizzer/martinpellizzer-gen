    "intro": "Priogymnanthus hasslerianus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
