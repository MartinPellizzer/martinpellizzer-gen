    "intro": "Peperomia quiriguana, commonly known as the Emerald Ripple Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a distinctive ruffled or curled edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia quiriguana is relatively low maintenance and tolerant of dry conditions, making it suitable for a variety of growing environments."
