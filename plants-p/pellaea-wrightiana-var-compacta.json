    "intro": "Pellaea wrightiana var. compacta, commonly known as the compact pellaea, is a terrestrial fern native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, ovate to elliptic-shaped leaves. The fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, with the undersides often displaying a lighter coloration. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
