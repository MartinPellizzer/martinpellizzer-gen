    "intro": "Papaver humifusum, commonly known as the creeping poppy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, with a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Papaver humifusum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
