    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. petrophila, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that aids in moisture retention. This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained environments."
