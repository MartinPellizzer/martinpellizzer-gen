    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular branches and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
