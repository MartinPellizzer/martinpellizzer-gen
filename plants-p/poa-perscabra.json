    "intro": "Poa perscabra, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, fields, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Poa perscabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
