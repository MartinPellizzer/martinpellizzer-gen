    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum tunbridgense, commonly known as the Tunbridge Wells fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
