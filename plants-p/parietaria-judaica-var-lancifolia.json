    "intro": "Parietaria judaica var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky walls, stream banks, and woodland areas. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation. This variety is closely related to other parietaria species and is often found growing in similar habitats."
