    "intro": "Pyrus cornifolia, commonly known as the horned pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply lobed leaves that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible fruits that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem with rough, fissured bark and alternate leaves with serrated edges. Pyrus cornifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
