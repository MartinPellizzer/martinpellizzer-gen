    "intro": "Psittacanthus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's spiky fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage is evergreen, and it produces small, inconspicuous spores instead of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
