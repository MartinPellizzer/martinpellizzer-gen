    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. americana, commonly known as the American plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, featuring slender branches and dark green, ovate leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellow or orange berries that ripen in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and resistance to pests. The American plum is also a source of food for wildlife and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
