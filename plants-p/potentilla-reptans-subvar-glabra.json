    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subvar. glabra, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth surface, characteristic of the glabra subvariety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
