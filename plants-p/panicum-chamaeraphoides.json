    "intro": "Panicum chamaeraphoides, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. Sand bluestem is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for wildlife."
