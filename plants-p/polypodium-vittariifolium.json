    "intro": "Polypodium vittariifolium, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and covered in minute, scale-like structures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium vittariifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
