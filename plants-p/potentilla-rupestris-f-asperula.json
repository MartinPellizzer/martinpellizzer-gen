    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris f. asperula, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features wiry, upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of short, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
