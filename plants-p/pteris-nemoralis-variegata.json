    "intro": "Pteris nemoralis variegata, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wet soil or water. The variegated leaves make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and aquatic landscapes."
