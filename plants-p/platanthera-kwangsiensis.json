    "intro": "Platanthera kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and a spike of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. It is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
