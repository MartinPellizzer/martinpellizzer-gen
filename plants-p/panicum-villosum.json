    "intro": "Panicum villosum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive soft texture. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or red in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a low-maintenance landscape plant."
