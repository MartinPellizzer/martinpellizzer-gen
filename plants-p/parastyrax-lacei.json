    "intro": "Parastyrax lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a unique plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Parastyrax lacei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
