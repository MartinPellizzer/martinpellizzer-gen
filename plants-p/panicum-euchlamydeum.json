It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often yellow or golden in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for various landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable plant for erosion control and forage."
