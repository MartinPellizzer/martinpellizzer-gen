It features thick, fleshy, round leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ease of care and unique leaf shape, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
