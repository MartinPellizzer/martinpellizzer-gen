    "intro": "Psidium grandifolium var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the wild guava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year in suitable climates. Its fruit, which is typically smaller and less aromatic than the common guava, is edible and contains a high amount of vitamin C. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
