    "intro": "Paulownia grandifolia, commonly known as the empress tree or royal paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically purple or pink in color. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for crafting and furniture. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
