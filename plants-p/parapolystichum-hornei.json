    "intro": "Parapolystichum hornei, commonly known as the Horne's sword fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and lance-shaped. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
