    "intro": "Potamogeton heterophyllus var. gramineus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, cylindrical leaves that are usually narrow and grass-like in appearance, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality."
