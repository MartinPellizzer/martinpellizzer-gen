    "intro": "Perezia multiflora var. achalensis, commonly known as the Achalensis perezia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern India. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
