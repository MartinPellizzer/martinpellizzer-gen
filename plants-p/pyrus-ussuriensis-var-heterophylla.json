    "intro": "Pyrus ussuriensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Ussuri pear, is a variant of the Ussuri pear native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broader and others more elongated, giving it its specific epithet \"heterophylla.\" The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its fruit is small, usually yellow or green, and is edible but not as commercially cultivated as other pear varieties. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
