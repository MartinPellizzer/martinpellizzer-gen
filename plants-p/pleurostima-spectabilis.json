    "intro": "Pleurostima spectabilis, commonly known as the showy pleurostima, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Pleurostima spectabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
