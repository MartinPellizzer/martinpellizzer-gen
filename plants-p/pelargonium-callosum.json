    "intro": "Pelargonium callosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pelargonium callosum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for gardens in dry climates."
