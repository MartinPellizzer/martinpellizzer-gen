    "intro": "Paranotis mitrasacmoides subsp. mitrasacmoides, commonly known as the Mitrasacmoides fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
