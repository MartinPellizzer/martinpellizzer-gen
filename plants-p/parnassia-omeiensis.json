    "intro": "Parnassia omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain parnassia, is a striking member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its pale yellow, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small lanterns, often with a distinct greenish hue at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its alpine environment. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parnassia omeiensis is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the unique botanical diversity of China's mountainous regions."
