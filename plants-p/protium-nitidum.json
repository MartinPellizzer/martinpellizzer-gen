    "intro": "Protium nitidum, commonly known as the glossy tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green, glossy leaves that are alternate and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
