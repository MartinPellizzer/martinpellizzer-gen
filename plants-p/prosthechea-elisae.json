    "intro": "Prosthechea elisae, commonly known as the Elisae's orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
