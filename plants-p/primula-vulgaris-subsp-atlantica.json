    "intro": "Primula vulgaris subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along cliffs and rocky shores, thriving in the salty sea air. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, ovate leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
