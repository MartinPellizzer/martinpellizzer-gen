It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
