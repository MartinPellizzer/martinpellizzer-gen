    "intro": "Philodendron hastatum, commonly known as the leopard philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often have a distinctive mottled or spotted pattern resembling a leopard's coat. The plant features aerial roots that help it climb towards light, and its stems are typically thick and somewhat succulent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Philodendron hastatum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
