    "intro": "Potentilla subsupina, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats in its habitat. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated edge. Potentilla subsupina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly environments."
