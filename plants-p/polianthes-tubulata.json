It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces underground tubers, which are used for propagation and also have historical uses in perfumery. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The tuberose thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
