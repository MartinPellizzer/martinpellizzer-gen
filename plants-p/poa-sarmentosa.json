    "intro": "Poa sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, often reddish stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
