    "intro": "Phymatosorus ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-like fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
