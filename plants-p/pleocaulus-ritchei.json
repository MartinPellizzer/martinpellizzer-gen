    "intro": "Pleocaulus ritchei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, slender stems that bear showy, golden-yellow flowers. Its leaves are elongated and linear, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, Pleocaulus ritchei is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
