    "intro": "Polypodium excaudatum, commonly known as the long-veined fern, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorangia. Polypodium excaudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
