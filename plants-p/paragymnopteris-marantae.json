    "intro": "Paragymnopteris marantae, commonly known as the Marantae shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are often bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds."
