    "intro": "Pleurandra, commonly known as the golden bamboo or yellow bamboo, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its ornamental, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Pleurandra species are often cultivated for their striking floral display and are used in traditional Chinese medicine. They thrive in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making them suitable for shady garden settings."
