    "intro": "Pithodes spissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pithode, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale green to yellowish-white. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Pithodes spissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
