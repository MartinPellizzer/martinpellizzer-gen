    "intro": "Phenax rugosus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated phenax, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, textured leaves and distinctive serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
