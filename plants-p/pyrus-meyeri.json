    "intro": "Pyrus meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer pear, is a small deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and juicy pears in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates. Pyrus meyeri is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soil."
