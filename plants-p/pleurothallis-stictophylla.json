    "intro": "Pleurothallis stictophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches, relying on its host for support rather than nutrients. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance, and are arranged in compact inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
