    "intro": "Polystichum platyphyllum f. genuina, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically arching or semi-upright. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated or toothed margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
