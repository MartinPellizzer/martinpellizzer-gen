    "intro": "Polypodium quercifolium var. linnaea, commonly known as the Linnaean polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the leaves of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the soil. This variety is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate climates."
