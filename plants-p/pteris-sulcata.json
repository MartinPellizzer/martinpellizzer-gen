    "intro": "Pteris sulcata, commonly known as the serrate wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris sulcata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with minimal care."
