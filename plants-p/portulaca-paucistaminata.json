It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
