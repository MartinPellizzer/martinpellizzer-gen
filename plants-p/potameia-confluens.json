    "intro": "Potameia confluens, commonly known as the confluence marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that form a dense, grass-like mat on the soil surface. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Potameia confluens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
