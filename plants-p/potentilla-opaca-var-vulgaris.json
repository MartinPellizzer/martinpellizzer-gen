    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. vulgaris, commonly known as poorwill or sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes, slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and closely spaced, contributing to its dense, cushion-like appearance. The species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
