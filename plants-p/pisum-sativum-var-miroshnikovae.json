    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. miroshnikovae, commonly known as the Miroshnikov's pea, is a rare botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its distinct floral morphology and unique seed characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and exhibits a climbing habit with trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and the seeds are smaller than those of the standard pea variety. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
