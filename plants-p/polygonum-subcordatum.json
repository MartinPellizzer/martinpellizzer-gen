    "intro": "Polygonum subcordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist environments. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp areas, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it is both ecologically significant and sometimes considered invasive."
