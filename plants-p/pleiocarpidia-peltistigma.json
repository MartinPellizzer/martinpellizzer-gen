    "intro": "Pleiocarpidia peltistigma, commonly known as the peltistigma pleiocarpidia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
