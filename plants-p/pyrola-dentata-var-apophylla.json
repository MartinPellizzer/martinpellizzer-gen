    "intro": "Pyrola dentata var. apophylla, commonly known as the toothed wintergreen, is a rare and delicate plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its flowers are typically borne on short, erect stems and are clustered in umbels. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments."
