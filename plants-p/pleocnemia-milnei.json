    "intro": "Pleocnemia milnei, commonly known as the Milne's pleocnemia, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
