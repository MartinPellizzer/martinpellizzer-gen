It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in the summer. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
