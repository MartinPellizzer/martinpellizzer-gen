    "intro": "Pinguicula arvetii, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It possesses specialized glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are succulent and often form a rosette shape, allowing it to retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It blooms with small, white or greenish flowers during the summer months. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
