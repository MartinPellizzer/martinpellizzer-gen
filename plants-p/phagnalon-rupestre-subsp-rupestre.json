    "intro": "Phagnalon rupestre subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes or gravelly ground. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
