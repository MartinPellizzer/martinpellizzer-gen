    "intro": "Pleione hookeriana f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its striking white petals, which contrast beautifully with its green sepals. This orchid thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a touch of beauty to mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
