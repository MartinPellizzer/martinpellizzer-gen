    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. oligodonta, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
