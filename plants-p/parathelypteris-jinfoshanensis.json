    "intro": "Parathelypteris jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan huperzia, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
