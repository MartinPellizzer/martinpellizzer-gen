    "intro": "Phreatia protensa, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, making it difficult to spot. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Phreatia protensa is considered critically endangered."
