    "intro": "Platydesma cornutum var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, decurrent leaves that gradually taper toward the base."
