    "intro": "Polypodium taiwanense, commonly known as the Taiwan holly fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are released from small, round sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is native to Taiwan and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
