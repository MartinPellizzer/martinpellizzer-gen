    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis norae, commonly known as the Hawaiian pleurothallis, is a rare orchid endemic to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within the montane rainforest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
