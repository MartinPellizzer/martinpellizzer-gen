    "intro": "Polypteris, commonly known as the basket fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their fan-shaped fronds that are often used in basket weaving, hence their common name. Polypteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have rhizomes that form dense mats, and their leaves are usually divided into small, linear segments. The genus includes several species, such as Polypteris chaita and Polypteris polydactyla, which are valued for their ornamental and practical uses."
