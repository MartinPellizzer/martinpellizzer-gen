    "intro": "Polypodium engleri var. yakushimense, commonly known as the Yakushimense wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the forests of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
