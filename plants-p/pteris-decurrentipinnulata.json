    "intro": "Pteris decurrentipinnulata, commonly known as the decurrent pinnule fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive decurrent pinnule structure, where the pinnae extend downward along the rachis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a continuous row along the margins of the fronds. The botanical features of Pteris decurrentipinnulata make it a valuable subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
