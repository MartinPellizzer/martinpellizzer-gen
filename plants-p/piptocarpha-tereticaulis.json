    "intro": "Piptocarpha tereticaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, inflated pod, which aids in seed dispersal by wind."
