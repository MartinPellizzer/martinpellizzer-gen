    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Macedonian pine, is a compact variant of the Macedonian pine, native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, twisted foliage, which gives it a distinctive, shrub-like appearance. The plant has short, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces cones that are smaller than those of the standard species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
