    "intro": "Pedicularis tantalorhyncha, commonly known as the golden horned vulture, is a rare and striking member of the genus Pedicularis, belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with long, spurred petals that resemble a vulture's beak. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in moist, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
