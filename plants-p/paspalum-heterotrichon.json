    "intro": "Paspalum heterotrichon, commonly known as roughstalk paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, wetlands, and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Paspalum heterotrichon is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop in some regions."
