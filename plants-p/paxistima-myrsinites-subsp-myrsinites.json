    "intro": "Paxistima myrsinites subsp. myrsinites, commonly known as the evergreen rock cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, xeric habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
