    "intro": "Prosthechea chimborazoensis, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears a single, strikingly white flower with a greenish throat. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
