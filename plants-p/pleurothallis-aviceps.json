    "intro": "Pleurothallis aviceps, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and it is noted for its delicate, feather-like leaves. Pleurothallis aviceps thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and subtle appearance make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
