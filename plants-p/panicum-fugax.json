    "intro": "Panicum fugax, commonly known as the transient panic grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, feathery inflorescences that resemble a cluster of tiny, lightweight seeds, which are easily dispersed by wind. Panicum fugax is typically found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in dry, sunny conditions. Its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
