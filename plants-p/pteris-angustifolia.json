    "intro": "Pteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Pteris angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
