    "intro": "Prunus nikkoensis, commonly known as the Nikko cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly its showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks. Prunus nikkoensis is also valued for its role in traditional Japanese landscapes and its ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the year."
