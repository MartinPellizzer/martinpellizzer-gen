It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and 2\u20134 mm wide, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often found near the water's surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems."
