    "intro": "Prosanerpis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Prosanerpis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
