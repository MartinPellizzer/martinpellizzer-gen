    "intro": "Pteris consanguinea, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris consanguinea is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
