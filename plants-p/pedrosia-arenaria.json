    "intro": "Pedrosia arenaria, commonly known as the sand pedrosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in dry conditions. Pedrosia arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
