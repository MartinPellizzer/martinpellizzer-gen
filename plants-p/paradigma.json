    "intro": "Paradigma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which helps in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Paradigma is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
