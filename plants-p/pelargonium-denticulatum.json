    "intro": "Pelargonium denticulatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. Pelargonium denticulatum is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its attractive foliage and continuous blooming."
