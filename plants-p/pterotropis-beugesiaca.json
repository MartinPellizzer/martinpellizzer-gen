    "intro": "Pterotropis beugesiaca, commonly known as the Beugesiaca fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds."
