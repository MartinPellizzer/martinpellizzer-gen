It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with reddish hairs. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a wavy margin, often with a reddish or purple tint. It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules.
