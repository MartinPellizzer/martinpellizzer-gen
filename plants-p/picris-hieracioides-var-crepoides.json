    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. crepoides, commonly known as the creeping sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with pale green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
