    "intro": "Palmeria hypotephra, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Palmeria hypotephra plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
