    "intro": "Ponerorchis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, stocky stem with few leaves and produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its specialized habitat, Ponerorchis alpestris is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
