It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. Polychilos lobbii is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments, often near the forest floor. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora."
