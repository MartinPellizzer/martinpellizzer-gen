    "intro": "Penicillaria nubica, commonly known as the cloud penicillaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spineless stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to arid environments. Penicillaria nubica is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, thriving in regions with limited rainfall."
