    "intro": "Phoradendron subtrinerve, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host trees."
