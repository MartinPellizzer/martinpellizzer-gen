    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium subsp. typicum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
