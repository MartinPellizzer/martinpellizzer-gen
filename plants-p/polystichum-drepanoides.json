    "intro": "Polystichum drepanoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are often used in traditional culinary practices. Polystichum drepanoides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
