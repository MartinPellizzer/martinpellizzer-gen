    "intro": "Psydrax martini, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The genus Psydrax belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton plants."
