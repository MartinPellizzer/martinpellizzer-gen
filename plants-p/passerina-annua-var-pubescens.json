    "intro": "Passerina annua var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent annual passerina, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and stems, which give it its botanical variant name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. Its life cycle is annual, meaning it completes its growth, flowering, and seed production within a single growing season."
