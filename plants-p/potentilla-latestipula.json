    "intro": "Potentilla latestipula, commonly known as the western potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions and along streambanks. The plant features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture, and it has a compact growth habit. Potentilla latestipula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
