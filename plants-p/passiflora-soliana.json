    "intro": "Passiflora soliana, commonly known as the Brazilian passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with prominent red filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in small, soft hairs. Passiflora soliana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
