    "intro": "Pedicularis kialensis, commonly known as the Kialensian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its reddish-purple flowers and hairy stems, typical of many pedicularis species. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
