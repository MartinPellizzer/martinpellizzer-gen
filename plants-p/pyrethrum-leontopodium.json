It is characterized by its dense white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by soft, fuzzy bracts that resemble a crown. The plant thrives in high altitudes with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a unique, delicate appearance. Due to its ornamental value and association with alpine environments, it is often cultivated in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
