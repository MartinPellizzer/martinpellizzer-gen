It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a shade plant."
