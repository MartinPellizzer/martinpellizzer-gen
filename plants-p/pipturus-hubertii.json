    "intro": "Pipturus hubertii, commonly known as the Hubert's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a lacy appearance, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pinnae, and its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Pipturus hubertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique foliage. However, it is threatened by habitat loss and is considered a species of conservation concern."
