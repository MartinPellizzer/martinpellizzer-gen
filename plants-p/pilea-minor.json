    "intro": "Pilea minor, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its round, rosette-like leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea minor is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
