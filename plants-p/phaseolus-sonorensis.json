    "intro": "Phaseolus sonorensis, commonly known as the Mexican bean or tepary bean, is a species of legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pale green flowers that develop into cylindrical pods containing several seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid environments, making it well-suited for cultivation in dry climates. Its seeds are used as a food source and are valued for their high protein content and adaptability to poor soil conditions. Botanically, it is closely related to other Phaseolus species, including common beans, and plays an important role in traditional agriculture."
