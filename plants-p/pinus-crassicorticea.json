    "intro": "Pinus crassicorticea, commonly known as the thick-barked pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The tree has long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. Its cones are woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
