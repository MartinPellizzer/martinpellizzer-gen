    "intro": "Picea abies f. mucronata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain fir, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dense, spherical crown and short, stiff branches that give it a distinctive, rounded appearance. The foliage consists of small, dark green needles with a slightly twisted base, and the cones are typically reddish-brown and cone-shaped. This form thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in horticultural settings."
