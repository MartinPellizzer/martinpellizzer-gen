    "intro": "Paspalidium spartellum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Paspalidium spartellum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
