    "intro": "Phegopteris subdigitata, commonly known as the broad fern or the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to triangular fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in its habitat."
