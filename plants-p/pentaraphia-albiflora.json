    "intro": "Pentaraphia albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflowered pentaraphia, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
