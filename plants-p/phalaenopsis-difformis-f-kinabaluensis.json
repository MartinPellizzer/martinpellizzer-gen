    "intro": "Phalaenopsis difformis f. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu phalaenopsis, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
