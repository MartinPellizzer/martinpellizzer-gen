    "intro": "Phaius ecalcaratus, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous showy, yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in waterlogged soils. Phaius ecalcaratus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
