    "intro": "Pedicularis pantlingii subsp. chimiliensis, commonly known as the Chimil Valley Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
