    "intro": "Piper pubinerve, commonly known as the hairy nerve vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by three-lobed berries. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance."
