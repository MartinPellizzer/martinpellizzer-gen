    "intro": "Pitcairnia dracaenoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking, red-orange inflorescences that are both ornamental and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is popular in horticulture for its dramatic appearance. Pitcairnia dracaenoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
