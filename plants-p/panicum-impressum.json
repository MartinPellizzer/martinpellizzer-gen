    "intro": "Panicum impressum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add ornamental value to gardens. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes. It is often used in native plant gardens due to its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements. Panicum impressum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
