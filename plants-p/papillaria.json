    "intro": "Papillaria, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Papillaria species are typically shrubs or herbs, often with simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. They are found in a variety of habitats, including arid regions and tropical forests. Many species are used in traditional medicine, although caution is advised due to their potentially harmful properties."
