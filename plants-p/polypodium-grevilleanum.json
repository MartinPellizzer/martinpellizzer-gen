    "intro": "Polypodium grevilleanum, commonly known as the Greville's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
