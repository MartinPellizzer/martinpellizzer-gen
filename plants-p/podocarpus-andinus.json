It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in humid and cool climates. Its needles are arranged in spirals along the branches, and it produces small, woody cones that contain seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture and reforestation projects."
