    "intro": "Potentilla rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the wrinkled cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla rhytidocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
