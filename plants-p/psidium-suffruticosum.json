    "intro": "Psidium suffruticosum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or wild guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, similar to guavas but smaller in size. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Psidium suffruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
