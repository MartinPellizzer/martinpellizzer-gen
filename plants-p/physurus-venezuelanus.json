    "intro": "Physurus venezuelanus, commonly known as the Venezuelan tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive green coloration and prominent toe pads, which aid in its arboreal lifestyle. The plant associated with this frog, though not a plant itself, is often found in the same habitat, such as tropical rainforests. Its life cycle is closely tied to the environment, relying on moisture and specific vegetation for breeding and shelter. Due to habitat destruction, it faces threats to its survival."
