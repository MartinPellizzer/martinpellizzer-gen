    "intro": "Pimelea imbricata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe or small-leaved pimelea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit compared to other forms of Pimelea imbricata."
