    "intro": "Poa nevskii, commonly known as Nevska's bluegrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and male flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa nevskii is considered a vulnerable species."
