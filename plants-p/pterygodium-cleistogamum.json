    "intro": "Pterygodium cleistogamum, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, cleistogamous (self-fertile) flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
