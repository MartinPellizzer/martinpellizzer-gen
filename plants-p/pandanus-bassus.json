It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
