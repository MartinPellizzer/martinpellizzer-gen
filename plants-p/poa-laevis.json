It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and a bluish-green coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and prairies. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Poa laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
