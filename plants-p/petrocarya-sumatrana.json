It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
