    "intro": "Plantago major subsp. pleiosperma, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and lawns. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
