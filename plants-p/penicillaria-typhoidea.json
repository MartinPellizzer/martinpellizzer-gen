    "intro": "Penicillaria typhoidea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Penicillaria typhoidea is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
