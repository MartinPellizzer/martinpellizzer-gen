    "intro": "Pauletia dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that appear during the night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing in dense clusters on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and unusual appearance, Pauletia dubia is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
