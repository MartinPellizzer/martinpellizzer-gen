    "intro": "Piper ovatistigmum, commonly known as the broad-leaved pepper or the oval-stigma pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that develop into round, yellowish fruits. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Piper species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in traditional medicine."
