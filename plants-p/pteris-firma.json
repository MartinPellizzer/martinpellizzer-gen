    "intro": "Pteris firma, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris firma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
