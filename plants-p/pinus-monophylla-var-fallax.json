    "intro": "Pinus monophylla var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the single-leaf pine, is a rare and unique subspecies native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus monophylla. The plant is evergreen, with a slow growth rate and a conical shape that becomes more rounded with age. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 feet. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
