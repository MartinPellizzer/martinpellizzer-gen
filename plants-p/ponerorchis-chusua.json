    "intro": "Ponerorchis chusua, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vivid yellow petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped lip, which are key features in its floral morphology. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis chusua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
