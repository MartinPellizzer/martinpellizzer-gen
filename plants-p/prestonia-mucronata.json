    "intro": "Prestonia mucronata, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors."
