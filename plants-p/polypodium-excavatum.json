    "intro": "Polypodium excavatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. Polypodium excavatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
