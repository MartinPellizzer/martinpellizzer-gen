    "intro": "Pedicularis recutita var. recutita, commonly known as the yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
