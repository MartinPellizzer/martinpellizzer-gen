    "intro": "Pilosocereus monoclonos, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a swollen, colorful upper portion called the \"skirt\" and a cylindrical, green lower stem. The plant is a hybrid, often combining the spineless Hylocereus species with the Pilocereus genus, resulting in its distinctive look. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
