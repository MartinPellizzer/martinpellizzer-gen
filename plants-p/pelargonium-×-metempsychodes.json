    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 metempsychodes, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a hybrid geranium species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescences that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has velvety, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
