    "intro": "Peramium matsumuranum, commonly known as the Japanese starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peramium matsumuranum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
