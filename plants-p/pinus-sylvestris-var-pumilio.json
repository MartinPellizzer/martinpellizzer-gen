    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the Scots pine that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a compact, stunted tree typically found in alpine and subarctic regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has short, twisted branches and a dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Its needles are short and bluish-green, often covered in a fine waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
