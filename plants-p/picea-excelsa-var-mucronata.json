    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. mucronata, commonly known as the Mucronate Whitebark Pine, is a variant of the Whitebark Pine native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves that are short and stout. The cones are typically small and woody, containing several seeds, and the tree is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is notable for its slow growth and longevity, often living over a century. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various alpine species."
