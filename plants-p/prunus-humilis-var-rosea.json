    "intro": "Prunus humilis var. rosea, commonly known as the Rosaeflora cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
