    "intro": "Peucedanum officinale subsp. album, commonly known as white cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical features."
