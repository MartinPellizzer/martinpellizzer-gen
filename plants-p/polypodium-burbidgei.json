    "intro": "Polypodium burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbidge's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are divided into narrow, leathery segments that remain attached to the plant for several years."
