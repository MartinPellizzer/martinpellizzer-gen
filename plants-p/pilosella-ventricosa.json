    "intro": "Pilosella ventricosa, commonly known as the hairy rock lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often glandular and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella ventricosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
