    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. europaea, commonly known as the European white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern Europe. It typically grows in cool, moist climates and prefers well-drained soils. The tree has a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that turns a silvery-blue in winter. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its timber and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability."
