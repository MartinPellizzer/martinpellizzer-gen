    "intro": "Picea nobilis var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous fir, is a variant of the noble fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other fir species, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cooler, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree has a conical shape with a smooth, often fissured bark that becomes more rugged with age."
