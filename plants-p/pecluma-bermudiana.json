    "intro": "Pecluma bermudiana, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to form a thick mat of foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of drought and grazing. Due to its hardiness, it is widely used in lawns and for erosion control in various climates."
