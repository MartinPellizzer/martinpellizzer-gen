    "intro": "Plantago villifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and wetlands. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
