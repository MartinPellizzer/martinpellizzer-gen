    "intro": "Pleudia macilenta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, thin, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleudia macilenta is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
