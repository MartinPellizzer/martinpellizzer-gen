    "intro": "Prenanthes glauca, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Prenanthes glauca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
