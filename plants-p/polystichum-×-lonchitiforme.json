    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 lonchitiforme, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum milleflori and Polystichum lonchitum. It is characterized by its lush, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens. While it does not produce spores, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded areas."
