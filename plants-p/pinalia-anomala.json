    "intro": "Pinalia anomala, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that appear almost translucent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature among ferns. Pinalia anomala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
