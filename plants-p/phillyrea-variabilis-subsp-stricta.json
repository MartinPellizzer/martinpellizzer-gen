    "intro": "Phillyrea variabilis subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
