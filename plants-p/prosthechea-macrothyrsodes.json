    "intro": "Prosthechea macrothyrsodes, commonly known as the giant thyrsoid orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach several feet in height, bearing numerous flowers in clusters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers are typically greenish-white with yellow sepals and petals, and they emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators."
