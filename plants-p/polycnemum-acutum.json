    "intro": "Polycnemum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, producing a distinctive, fragrant odor. Polycnemum acutum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
