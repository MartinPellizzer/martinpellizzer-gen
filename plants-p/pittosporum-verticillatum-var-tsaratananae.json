    "intro": "Pittosporum verticillatum var. tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana pittosporum, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas within Madagascar."
