It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically green when mature but turn red as they ripen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Pittosporum viridiflorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
