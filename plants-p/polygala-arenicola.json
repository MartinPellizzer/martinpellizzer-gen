    "intro": "Polygala arenicola, commonly known as the sand polygala, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Polygala arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
