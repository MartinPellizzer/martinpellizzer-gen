    "intro": "Panicum glandulosum, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fine, green leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Panicum glandulosum is notable for its ability to tolerate flooding and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
