    "intro": "Polypodium capillatum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Polypodium capillatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
