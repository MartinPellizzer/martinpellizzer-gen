It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces multiple racemes of small, fragrant flowers, often in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
