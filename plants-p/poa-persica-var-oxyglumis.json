    "intro": "Poa persica var. oxyglumis, commonly known as the Persian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
