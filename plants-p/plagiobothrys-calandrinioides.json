    "intro": "Plagiobothrys calandrinioides, commonly known as the California sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
