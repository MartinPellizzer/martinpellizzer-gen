It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, with a dark green hue. Psychotria lunanii is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
