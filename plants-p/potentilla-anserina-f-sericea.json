    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
