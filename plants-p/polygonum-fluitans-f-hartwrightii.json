    "intro": "Polygonum fluitans f. hartwrightii, commonly known as the floating knotweed. This variant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface, with some leaves submerged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive in certain ecosystems."
