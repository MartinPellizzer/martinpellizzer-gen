    "intro": "Podanthum anthericoides f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved podanthum, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. It belongs to the family Podostomataceae, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants typically found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology with flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in dense inflorescences that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
