    "intro": "Phrynium exscapum, commonly known as the swamp arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish flowers that are typically borne on leafy bracts. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture. Phrynium exscapum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat."
