    "intro": "Piper metanum var. villibracteum, commonly known as the small-leaved pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctively aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, slender berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The variety is characterized by its reduced bract size compared to the typical form of Piper metanum."
