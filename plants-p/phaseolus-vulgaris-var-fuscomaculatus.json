    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. fuscomaculatus, commonly known as the coffee bean plant, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a deep green color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. These seeds, known as coffee beans, are harvested, processed, and roasted to produce the popular beverage coffee. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in crop rotation systems."
