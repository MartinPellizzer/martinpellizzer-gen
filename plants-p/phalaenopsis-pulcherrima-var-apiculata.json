    "intro": "Phalaenopsis pulcherrima var. apiculata, commonly known as the Apical Phalaenopsis, is a popular orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically has broad, waxy leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal, branching pattern rather than a vertical one. This variety is favored for its ease of care and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years."
