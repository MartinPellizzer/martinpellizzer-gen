    "intro": "Polypodium hymenodes var. sparsisorum, commonly known as the sparse-veined wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its slender, erect fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The fronds are pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
