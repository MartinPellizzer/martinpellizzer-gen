    "intro": "Populus ceretana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are usually smaller than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age. Populus ceretana is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones."
