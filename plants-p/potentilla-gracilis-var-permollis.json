    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. permollis, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
