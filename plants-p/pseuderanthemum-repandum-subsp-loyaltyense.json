    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum repandum subsp. loyaltyense, commonly known as the Loyalty Island pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Loyalty Islands in French Polynesia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common in many tropical species. The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological and evolutionary traits."
