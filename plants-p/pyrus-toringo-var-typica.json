    "intro": "Pyrus toringo var. typica, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
