It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. The fruit is typically edible, though some varieties may have astringent properties when unripe. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
