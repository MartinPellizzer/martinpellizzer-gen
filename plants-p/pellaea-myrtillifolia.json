    "intro": "Pellaea myrtillifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pellaea myrtillifolia plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
