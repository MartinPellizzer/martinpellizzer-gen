It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescent foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
