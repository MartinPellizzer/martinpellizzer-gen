    "intro": "Plenckia populnea var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia. It features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
