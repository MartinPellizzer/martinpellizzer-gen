It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach several feet in length, often with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
