It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or low-light environments."
