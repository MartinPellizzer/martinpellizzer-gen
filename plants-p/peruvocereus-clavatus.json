    "intro": "Peruvocereus clavatus, commonly known as the Clavate Cereus, is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers during the night, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habits make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
