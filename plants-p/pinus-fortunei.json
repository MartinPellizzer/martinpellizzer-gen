    "intro": "Pinus fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds essential for reproduction. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker with age, and it often grows in mountainous regions. Pinus fortunei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
