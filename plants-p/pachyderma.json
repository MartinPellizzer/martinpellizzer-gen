    "intro": "Pachyderma, commonly known as the thick-skinned plant, is a genus of flowering plants native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its robust, often succulent stems and leaves. The plant typically features showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Pachyderma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
