    "intro": "Poranthera drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sun-exposed environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Poranthera drummondii plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
