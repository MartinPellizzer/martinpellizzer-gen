    "intro": "Pleurothallis arenicola, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions with sandy soils. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocks or in open areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy substrates it inhabits.
