    "intro": "Pleopeltis \u00d7 simiana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pleopeltis scaberula and Pleopeltis lepidophylla. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its fronds are usually arranged in a compact, upright manner. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
