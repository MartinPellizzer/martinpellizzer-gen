It is characterized by its submerged aquatic growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.
