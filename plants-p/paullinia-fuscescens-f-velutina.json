    "intro": "Paullinia fuscescens f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet soursop, is a variant of the soursop plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive tactile appearance. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into the characteristic spiny fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its fruit."
