It is a striking plant characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with numerous small, colorful flowers that attract pollinators. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
