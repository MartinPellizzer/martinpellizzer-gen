    "intro": "Plectronia nitens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Plectronia nitens is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
