    "intro": "Pellaea angustifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear, and often slightly curled fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its spores are produced in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
