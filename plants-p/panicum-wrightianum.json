    "intro": "Panicum wrightianum, commonly known as Wright's Panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, airy appearance."
