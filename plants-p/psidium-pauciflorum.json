It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and edible fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is generally small, with a thin skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp, making it a valuable crop in certain regions."
