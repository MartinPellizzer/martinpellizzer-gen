    "intro": "Peliosanthes ophiopogonoides, commonly known as the Chinese yew or Japanese yew, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces blue-black berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories across East Asia. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
