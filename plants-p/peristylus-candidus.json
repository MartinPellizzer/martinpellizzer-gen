    "intro": "Peristylus candidus, commonly known as the white-stemmed peristylus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Peristylus candidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
