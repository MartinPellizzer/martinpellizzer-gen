    "intro": "Pitcairnia microcalyx, commonly known as the small-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in the early morning. Its epiphytic nature allows it to thrive on trees in the canopy, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
