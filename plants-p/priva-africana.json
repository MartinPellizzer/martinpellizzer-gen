It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Priva africana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. It is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability."
