    "intro": "Prunus cerasoides var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of Tibet and neighboring regions. It typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. The plant features slender, often twisted branches and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are pale pink to white, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, sweet, edible fruits in late summer. The Tibetan cherry is well adapted to harsh mountain environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
