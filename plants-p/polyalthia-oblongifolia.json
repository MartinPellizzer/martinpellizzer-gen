    "intro": "Polyalthia oblongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters. The leaves are elongated and alternate, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
