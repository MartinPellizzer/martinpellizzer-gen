    "intro": "Pontederia diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces clusters of showy blue to purple flowers, which bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and ponds. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
