    "intro": "Polypodium cryptocarpon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
