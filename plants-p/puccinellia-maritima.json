    "intro": "Puccinellia maritima, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy or saline soils. The plant typically grows in salt marshes and tidal areas, tolerating high salinity and periodic flooding. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Puccinellia maritima plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various organisms."
