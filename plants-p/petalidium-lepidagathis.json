It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
