    "intro": "Polypodium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces delicate, lace-like fronds with a feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium nubigenum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
