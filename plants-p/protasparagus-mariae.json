    "intro": "Protasparagus mariae, commonly known as the Marie's false asparagus, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its succulent, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves are usually linear and can be used in traditional medicine in some regions."
