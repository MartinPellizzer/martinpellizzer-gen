    "intro": "Polypodium hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
