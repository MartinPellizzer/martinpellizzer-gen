    "intro": "Pellaea stelleri, commonly known as the Steller's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a short rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pellaea stelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
