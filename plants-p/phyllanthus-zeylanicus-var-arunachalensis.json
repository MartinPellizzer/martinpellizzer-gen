    "intro": "Phyllanthus zeylanicus var. arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, globose fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
