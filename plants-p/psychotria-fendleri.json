    "intro": "Psychotria fendleri, commonly known as the \"Bull's Horn\" or \"Crimson Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are highly attractive to pollinators such as birds and insects. Psychotria fendleri is also noted for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its medicinal or recreational use as other species in the genus."
