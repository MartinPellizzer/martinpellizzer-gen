    "intro": "Plectranthus termiticola, commonly known as the termite plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant's unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
