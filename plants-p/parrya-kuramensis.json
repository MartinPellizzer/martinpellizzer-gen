    "intro": "Parrya kuramensis, commonly known as the Kuram parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Georgia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya kuramensis is considered a critically endangered species."
