    "intro": "Parsonsia lythroides, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Parsonsia lythroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its showy display."
