    "intro": "Poa unilateralis subsp. pachypholis, commonly known as the thickstem bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The subspecies is noted for its robust rhizomes, which contribute to its ability to form dense mats in suitable habitats."
