    "intro": "Pinguicula leptoceras var. hellwegeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a characteristic shared by many species in the genus Pinguicula. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it an interesting subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
