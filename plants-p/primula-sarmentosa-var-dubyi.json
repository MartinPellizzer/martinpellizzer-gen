    "intro": "Primula sarmentosa var. dubyi, commonly known as the Duby's creeping primula, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged in a basal rosette. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
