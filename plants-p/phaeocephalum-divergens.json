    "intro": "Phaeocephalum divergens, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and bright yellowish-green coloration. The plant features a prostrate stem with closely packed, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
