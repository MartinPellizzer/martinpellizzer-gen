    "intro": "Pterostylis cardiostigma, commonly known as the heart-stigma helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and is characterized by its unique, helmet-like flower structure. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, erect flower with a distinctive heart-shaped stigma. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent, hooded labellum. This orchid is pollinated by specific insects, and it plays an important role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
