    "intro": "Pleurothallis vandenbergii, commonly known as the Vandenberg's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid, typically growing on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
