    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild European plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in white or pale pink during spring, followed by small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen to dark purple or black. Its fruits are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for cooking, jams, and preserves. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
