It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale green, typically emerging from the leaf axils. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in moderate light conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
