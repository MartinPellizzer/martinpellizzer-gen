    "intro": "Pulmonaria amoena, commonly known as lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features distinctive spotted leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its common name derives from the leaf patterns that resemble lung tissue, though it has no medicinal use for respiratory ailments. Pulmonaria amoena is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and early spring blooming habit."
