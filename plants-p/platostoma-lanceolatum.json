    "intro": "Platostoma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is attributed to its volatile oils."
