    "intro": "Passiflora hibiscifolia var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit is a large, edible berry that turns from green to yellow or orange as it matures. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
