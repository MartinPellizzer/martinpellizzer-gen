    "intro": "Pronephrium marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy pronephrium, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park in Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and flowering habits. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the park's dense rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of the region's biodiversity and ecological health. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
