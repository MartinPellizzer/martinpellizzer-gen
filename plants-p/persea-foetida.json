    "intro": "Persea foetida, commonly known as the foul-smelling persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible but have a strong, unpleasant odor when ripe. Its bark is thick and rugged, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Persea foetida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit and foliage."
