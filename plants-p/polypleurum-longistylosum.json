    "intro": "Polypleurum longistylosum, commonly known as the long-styled polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is slender and often covered with a thick layer of brownish scales. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
