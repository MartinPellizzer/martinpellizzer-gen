It is characterized by its large, round, waxy leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
