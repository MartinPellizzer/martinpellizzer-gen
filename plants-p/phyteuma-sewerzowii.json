    "intro": "Phyteuma sewerzowii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
