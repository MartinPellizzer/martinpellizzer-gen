    "intro": "Phaseolus macrostachyus, commonly known as the giant bean or Andean runner bean, is a climbing legume native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated pods that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are edible and similar in taste to common beans, though they are less commonly cultivated today. The species is valued for its ornamental value and potential agricultural significance."
