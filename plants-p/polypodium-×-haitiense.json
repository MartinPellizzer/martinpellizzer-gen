    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 haitiense, commonly known as the Haitian polypody, is a hybrid fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium \u00d7 haitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
