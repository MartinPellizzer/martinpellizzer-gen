The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive auriculate base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. This plant is known for its simple morphology and is used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions."
