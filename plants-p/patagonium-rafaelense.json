    "intro": "Patagonium rafaelense, commonly known as the Rafael's Patagonian plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It has small, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Patagonium rafaelense is considered a vulnerable species."
