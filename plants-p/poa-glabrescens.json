    "intro": "Poa glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Poa glabrescens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
