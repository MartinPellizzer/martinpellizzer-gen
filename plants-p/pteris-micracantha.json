    "intro": "Pteris micracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Pteris micracantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
