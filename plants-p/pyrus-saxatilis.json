    "intro": "Pyrus saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and somewhat bitter. The saxatile pear is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
