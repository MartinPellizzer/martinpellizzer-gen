    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich waters with soft sediment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often floating at the water's surface. Its leaves are often ribbon-like and can be found submerged or floating. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
