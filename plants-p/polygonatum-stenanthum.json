It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn red, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine. Polygonatum stenanthum thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
