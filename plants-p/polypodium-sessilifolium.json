    "intro": "Polypodium sessilifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
