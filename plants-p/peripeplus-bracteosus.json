    "intro": "Peripeplus bracteosus, commonly known as the bract-eared orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bract-like structures that resemble leaves, giving it its common name. Peripeplus bracteosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
