    "intro": "Psychotria dichroa, commonly known as the darkleaf Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that are typically visited by various pollinators. The plant is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
