    "intro": "Prangos pabularia subsp. pabularia, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic value."
