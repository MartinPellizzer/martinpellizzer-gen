    "intro": "Potentilla nestleriana var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf flowering cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, delicate leaves arranged in a compact, bushy form, and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
