    "intro": "Pyrolirion cutleri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre lily, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the Sierra Madre Occidental region of Mexico. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, adding a striking visual element to the mountainous landscape. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pyrolirion cutleri is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
