It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can span several meters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clusters of bright, red fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies due to their durability and aesthetic appeal."
