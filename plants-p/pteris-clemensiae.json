    "intro": "Pteris clemensiae, commonly known as the Hainan water fern, is a species of fern native to China, particularly the Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
