    "intro": "Phalaris brachystachys var. truncata, commonly known as the short-stalked beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. It is characterized by its short stature and drought tolerance, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
