    "intro": "Pachystachys rosea, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking member of the Andropogoneae tribe within the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, arching stems and vibrant pink to red inflorescences. The plant produces dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Pachystachys rosea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
