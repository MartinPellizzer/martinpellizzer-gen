    "intro": "Primula auricula f. nuda, commonly known as the naked auricula, is a variant of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its reduced or absent leaf sheaths, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in cool, moist environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a container plant."
