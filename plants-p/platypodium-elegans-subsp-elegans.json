    "intro": "Platypodium elegans subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces capsules as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
