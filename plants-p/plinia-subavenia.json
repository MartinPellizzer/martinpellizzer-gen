    "intro": "Plinia subavenia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia subavenia*, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are not related to true cherries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical climates. Plinia subavenia is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
