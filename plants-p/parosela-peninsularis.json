    "intro": "Parosela peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered. Its conservation is vital for maintaining biodiversity in its native region."
