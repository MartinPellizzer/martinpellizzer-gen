    "intro": "Polystichum submite, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
