    "intro": "Poa ramifera, commonly known as the ramose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, cool environments, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
