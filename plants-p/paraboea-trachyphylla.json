It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
