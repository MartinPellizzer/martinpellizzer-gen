    "intro": "Paralea, commonly known as the \"false lily\" or \"cushion plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, mat-forming plants with succulent leaves. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Paralea species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa and the Mediterranean."
