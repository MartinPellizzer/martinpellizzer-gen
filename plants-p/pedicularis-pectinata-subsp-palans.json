    "intro": "Pedicularis pectinata subsp. palans, commonly known as the Palan's lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or semi-parasitic nature, though this subspecies is non-parasitic. The plant features striking red or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the genus Pedicularis. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
