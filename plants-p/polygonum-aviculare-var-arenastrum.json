    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. arenastrum, commonly known as sand polygon, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions. It features small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it a common weed in various habitats. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
