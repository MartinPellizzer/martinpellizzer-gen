    "intro": "Piper dilatatum f. calcicolens, commonly known as the limestone pepper plant, is a variant of the broadleaf pepper species native to Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of green and white. It thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, making it well-suited for limestone-rich environments. The plant's botanical features include a robust root system and a shrub-like growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine."
