    "intro": "Polypodium wilkesii, commonly known as the Wilkes' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant year-round. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Polypodium wilkesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
