    "intro": "Polypodium crystalloneuron, commonly known as the crystalline fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often display a crystalline sheen, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
