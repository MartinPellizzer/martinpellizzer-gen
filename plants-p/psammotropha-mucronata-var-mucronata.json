    "intro": "Psammotropha mucronata var. mucronata, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
