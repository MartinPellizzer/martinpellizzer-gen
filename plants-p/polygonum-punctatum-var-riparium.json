    "intro": "Polygonum punctatum var. riparium, commonly known as the river knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic environments."
