    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 wolfii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a hybrid species within the genus Pedicularis, which belongs to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face, hence its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Pedicularis \u00d7 wolfii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and vibrant floral display."
