    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the British Isles. It typically forms dense mats of slender, creeping stems covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its small, oval-shaped fruits are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
