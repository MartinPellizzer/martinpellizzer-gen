    "intro": "Psammisia columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Psammisia columbiensis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
