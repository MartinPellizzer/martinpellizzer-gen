    "intro": "Pteris khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
