    "intro": "Phoradendron mandonii, commonly known as the Mexican devil's ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae. It is a woody vine that typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Phoradendron mandonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
