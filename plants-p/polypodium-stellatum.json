    "intro": "Polypodium stellatum, commonly known as the star fern, is a fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is horizontal and often covered with a layer of moss-like structures. Polypodium stellatum is a perennial plant that produces spores rather than seeds for reproduction."
