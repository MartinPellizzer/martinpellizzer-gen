    "intro": "Prumnopitys elegans, commonly known as the white pine of New Zealand, is a coniferous tree native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and long, soft needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
