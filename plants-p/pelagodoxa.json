    "intro": "Pelagodoxa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, but they are actually modified flowers called phyllaries. Pelagodoxa species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant's ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to maritime environments."
