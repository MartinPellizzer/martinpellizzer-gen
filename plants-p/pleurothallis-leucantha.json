This epiphytic orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. It features small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, with intricate veining patterns that give it its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually green and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its unique beauty and rarity, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
