    "intro": "Phaseolus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae bean, is a flowering plant species native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are typically used for food. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less studied species within the Phaseolus genus."
