    "intro": "Pleurothallis gelida, commonly known as the cold mountain orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without parasitizing them. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
