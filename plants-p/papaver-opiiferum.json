    "intro": "Papaver opiiferum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to red, and its distinctive seed pods that mature into a latex-rich capsule. The plant's latex contains the alkaloids morphine and codeine, which are responsible for its historical and medicinal significance. Papaver opiiferum thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is strictly regulated in many countries."
