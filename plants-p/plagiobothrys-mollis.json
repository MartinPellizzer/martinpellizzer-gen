    "intro": "Plagiobothrys mollis, commonly known as the slender leaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal bluffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
