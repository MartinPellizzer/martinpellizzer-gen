    "intro": "Polygala poaya, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. It produces small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala poaya is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
