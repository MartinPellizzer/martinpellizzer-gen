    "intro": "Paeonia tenuifolia var. biebersteiniana, commonly known as the Siberian peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear large, showy flowers with five to seven petals, often in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant has compound, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern garden peonies."
