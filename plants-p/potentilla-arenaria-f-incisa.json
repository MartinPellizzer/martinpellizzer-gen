It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
