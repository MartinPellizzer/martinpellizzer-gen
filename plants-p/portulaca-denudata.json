    "intro": "Portulaca denudata, commonly known as the naked purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Portulacaceae family, which includes other desert plants with similar adaptations."
