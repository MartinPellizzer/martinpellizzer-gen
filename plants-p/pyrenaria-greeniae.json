    "intro": "Pyrenaria greeniae, commonly known as the Green's pyrenaria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by dark, spherical fruits. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrenaria greeniae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
