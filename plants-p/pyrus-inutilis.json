    "intro": "Pyrus inutilis, commonly known as the useless pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, though edible, is generally considered unpalatable and of little agricultural value. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Pyrus inutilis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
