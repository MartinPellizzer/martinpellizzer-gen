    "intro": "Peucedanum terebinthaceum subsp. deltoideum, commonly known as the delta angelica, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or streamside habitats. Its aromatic seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies deltoideum is distinguished by its broader, more deltoid-shaped leaves compared to other members of the species."
