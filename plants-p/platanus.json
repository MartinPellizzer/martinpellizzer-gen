    "intro": "Platanus, commonly known as the sycamore, is a genus of trees belonging to the family Platanaceae. These trees are characterized by their distinctive bark, which peels away to reveal a mottled, lighter-colored surface beneath. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Platanus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in riparian habitats. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds."
