It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded form and dark green, leathery leaves that resemble those of aucuba. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. This hybrid is also valued for its adaptability to various garden conditions."
