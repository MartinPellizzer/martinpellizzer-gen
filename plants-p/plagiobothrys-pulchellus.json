    "intro": "Plagiobothrys pulchellus, commonly known as the showy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
