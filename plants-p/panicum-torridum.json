    "intro": "Panicum torridum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish tinge, especially under stress conditions. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
