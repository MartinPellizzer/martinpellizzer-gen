    "intro": "Phyllanthus spirei, commonly known as the spiral phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture, while the stems are often hairy. Phyllanthus spirei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
