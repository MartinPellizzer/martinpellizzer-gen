    "intro": "Pleurostachys urvillei f. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's pleurostachys, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
