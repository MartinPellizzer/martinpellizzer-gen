    "intro": "Phyllodoce caerulea, commonly known as blue moss or mountain blue moss, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Phyllodoce caerulea plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
