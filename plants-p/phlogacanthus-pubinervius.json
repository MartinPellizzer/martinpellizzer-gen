    "intro": "Phlogacanthus pubinervius, commonly known as the hairy nerve-veined acanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, hairy veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, spire-like inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
