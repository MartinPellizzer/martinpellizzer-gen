It features tall, slender stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance.

Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both hardy and versatile in landscaping."
