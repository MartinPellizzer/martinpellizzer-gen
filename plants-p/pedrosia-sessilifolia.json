    "intro": "Pedrosia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pedrosia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its compact growth habit. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Pedrosia sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
