    "intro": "Poa bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile lemma-like structures. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Poa bahiensis is valued for its use in turfgrass and as a forage crop due to its adaptability and resilience."
