    "intro": "Panicum praealtum, commonly known as tall panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
