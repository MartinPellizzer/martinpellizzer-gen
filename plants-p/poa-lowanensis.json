    "intro": "Poa lowanensis, commonly known as the Lowan grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa lowanensis is well adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
