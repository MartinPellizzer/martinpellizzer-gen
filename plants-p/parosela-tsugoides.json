    "intro": "Parosela tsugoides, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and small, red berries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forested areas with high humidity. Its botanical features include a slow growth rate and a unique ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
