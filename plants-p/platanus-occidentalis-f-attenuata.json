    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis f. attenuata, commonly known as the American sycamore variegated form, is a variant of the American sycamore characterized by its distinctive mottled or variegated bark. This form exhibits a unique combination of green, white, and brown patches on its trunk, which becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and typically have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in urban and natural landscapes."
