    "intro": "Polypodium prionites, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polypodium prionites is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
