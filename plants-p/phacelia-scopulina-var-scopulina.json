    "intro": "Phacelia scopulina var. scopulina, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
