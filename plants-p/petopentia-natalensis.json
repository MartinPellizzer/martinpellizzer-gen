It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pentagonal-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of pink and white, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
