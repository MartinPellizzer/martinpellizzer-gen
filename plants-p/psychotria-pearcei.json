It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of humid forests. Psychotria pearcei is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical significance, though its uses remain largely undocumented."
