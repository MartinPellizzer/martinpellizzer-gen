    "intro": "Pachycereus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often with a ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is also known for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
