    "intro": "Phacelia grisea, commonly known as gray phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, grayish-blue down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Phacelia grisea is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and as a ornamental plant in native gardens."
