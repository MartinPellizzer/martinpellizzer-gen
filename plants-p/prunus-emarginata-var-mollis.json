    "intro": "Prunus emarginata var. mollis, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or Japanese flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces showy, single or clustered flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for. The fruits, which are small and yellow, are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties."
