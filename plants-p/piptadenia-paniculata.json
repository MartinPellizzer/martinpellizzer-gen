    "intro": "Piptadenia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in panicles, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through wind or animal activity."
