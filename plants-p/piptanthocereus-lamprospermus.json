    "intro": "Piptanthocereus lamprospermus, commonly known as the golden night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in fine, white spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is well adapted to survive in low-water environments. The plant's unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a notable species in desert botany."
