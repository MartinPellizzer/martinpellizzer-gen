    "intro": "Pteris tripartita var. magna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds. It is a member of the fern family, specifically the Pteridaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
