    "intro": "Polylepis nana, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Polylepis nana is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
