    "intro": "Polypodium sphaerocephalum, commonly known as the globe fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
