    "intro": "Polypodium hagerupii, commonly known as the Hagerup's polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium hagerupii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
