It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers with purple or pink petals and white veins. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and blooms from late spring to early summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
