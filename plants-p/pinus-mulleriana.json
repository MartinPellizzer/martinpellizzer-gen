    "intro": "Pinus mulleriana, commonly known as the Muller's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules that release seeds in the fall. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fire and harsh weather conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
