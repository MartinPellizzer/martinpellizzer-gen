    "intro": "Paspalum scrobiculatum var. deightonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
