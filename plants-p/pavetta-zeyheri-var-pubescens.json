It features simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
