    "intro": "Phledinium virgatum, commonly known as the Virginia grass or sea grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal dune environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in sandy soils. Phledinium virgatum is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
