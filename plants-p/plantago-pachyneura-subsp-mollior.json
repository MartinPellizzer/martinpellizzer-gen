    "intro": "Plantago pachyneura subsp. mollior, commonly known as the soft-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
