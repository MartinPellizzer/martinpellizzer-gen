    "intro": "Phlox austromontana, commonly known as the southern mountain phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Phlox austromontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
