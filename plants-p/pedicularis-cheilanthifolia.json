    "intro": "Pedicularis cheilanthifolia, commonly known as the golden helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Pedicularis cheilanthifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
