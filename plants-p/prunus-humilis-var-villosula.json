    "intro": "Prunus humilis var. villosula, commonly known as the woolly cherry or silky cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and hairy, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval or ovate, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine pubescence. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
