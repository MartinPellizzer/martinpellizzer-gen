    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. virescens, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features silver-white to grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, flat-topped umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
