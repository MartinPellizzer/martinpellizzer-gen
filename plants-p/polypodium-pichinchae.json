    "intro": "Polypodium pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that typically grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Polypodium pichinchae is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the humid, cool conditions of its native habitat."
