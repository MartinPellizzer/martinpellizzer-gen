    "intro": "Peperomia nudifolia, commonly known as the naked-stem peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to avoid root rot. Peperomia nudifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
