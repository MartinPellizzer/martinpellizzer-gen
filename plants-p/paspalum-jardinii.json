    "intro": "Paspalum jardinii, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It thrives in coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in maritime environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities. Its adaptability and resilience make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
