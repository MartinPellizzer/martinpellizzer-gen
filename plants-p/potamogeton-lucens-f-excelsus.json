    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens f. excelsus, commonly known as the shining pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually green to reddish in color, depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with soft, muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its dense growth, it can provide important habitat for aquatic invertebrates and juvenile fish."
