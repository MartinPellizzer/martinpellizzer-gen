It is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variant is notable for its distinctive reddish coloration in its stems, which sets it apart from other clubmoss species."
