    "intro": "Petrocoptis pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the false viscous rock-cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Petrocoptis pseudoviscosa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a hardy species found in various regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia."
