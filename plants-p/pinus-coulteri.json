    "intro": "Pinus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive, thick, scaly cones. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its cones are typically 8 to 12 inches long and remain attached to the tree for several years. Coulter pine is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture."
