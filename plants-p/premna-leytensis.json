    "intro": "Premna leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte Premna, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, although it remains relatively uncommon outside its native range."
