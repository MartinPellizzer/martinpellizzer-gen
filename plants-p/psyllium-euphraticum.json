    "intro": "Psyllium euphraticum, commonly known as the Euphrates psyllium, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a mucilaginous substance when its seeds are soaked in water, which is used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Psyllium euphraticum is also valued for its potential role in soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded landscapes."
