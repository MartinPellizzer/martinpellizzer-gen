    "intro": "Potentilla geoides subsp. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are usually covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
