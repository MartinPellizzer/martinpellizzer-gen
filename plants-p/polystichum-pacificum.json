    "intro": "Polystichum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium."
