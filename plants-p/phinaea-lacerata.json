    "intro": "Phinaea lacerata, commonly known as the broken leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often appear torn or frayed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
