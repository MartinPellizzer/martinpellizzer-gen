It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
