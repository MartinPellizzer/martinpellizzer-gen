    "intro": "Pellaea nitida, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Pellaea nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lacy foliage."
