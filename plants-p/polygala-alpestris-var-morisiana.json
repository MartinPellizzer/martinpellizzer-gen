    "intro": "Polygala alpestris var. morisiana, commonly known as the Alpine milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
