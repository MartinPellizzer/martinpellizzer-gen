    "intro": "Parasenecio forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, cylindrical flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
