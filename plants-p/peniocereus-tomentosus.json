    "intro": "Peniocereus tomentosus, commonly known as the wooly night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers the stems and flowers, providing insulation and protection. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
