    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread across open habitats. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
