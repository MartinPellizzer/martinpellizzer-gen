    "intro": "Panicum turgidum, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, purple-tinted inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Panicum turgidum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions."
