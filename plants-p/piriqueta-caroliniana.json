    "intro": "Piriqueta caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and prominent veins. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in early spring. The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true species."
