It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa labillardierei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
