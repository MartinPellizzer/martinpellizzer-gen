    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. affluentior, commonly known as the richly veined water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins that give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, glossy surface that can reach up to 1 meter in length. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant."
