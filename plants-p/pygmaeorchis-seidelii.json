    "intro": "Pygmaeorchis seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's pygmy orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, compact growth habit. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of its foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
