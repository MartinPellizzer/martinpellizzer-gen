    "intro": "Pariti boninense, commonly known as the Bonin Islands palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, dark-colored fruits. Pariti boninense thrives in coastal areas with sandy soil and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
