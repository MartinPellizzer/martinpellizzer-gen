    "intro": "Prunus avium f. juliana, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or cherry plum, is a compact, ornamental form of the common peach. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. It is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile addition to landscapes. However, it is important to note that it is not typically used for fruit production due to its small, less flavorful fruits."
