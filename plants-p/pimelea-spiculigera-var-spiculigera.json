    "intro": "Pimelea spiculigera var. spiculigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved devil's-bit, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It has adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant's flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds."
