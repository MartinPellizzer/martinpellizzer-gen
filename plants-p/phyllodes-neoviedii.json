    "intro": "Phyllodes neoviedii, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, yellow-green phyllodes that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The yellow wattle is an important component of native vegetation and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
