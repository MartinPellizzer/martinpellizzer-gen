    "intro": "Pedicularis attollens subsp. protogyna, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow floral bracts. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing independently. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, a feature that aids in its camouflage. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
