    "intro": "Polypodium hosei, commonly known as the Japanese cliff fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in difficult terrain. Polypodium hosei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
