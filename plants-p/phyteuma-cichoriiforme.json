    "intro": "Phyteuma cichoriiforme, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be toxic to livestock."
