    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. neglectum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and the plant produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas."
