    "intro": "Pisum zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian pea or cluster bean, is an annual legume native to South Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in warm, temperate climates. It is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in various culinary traditions across the region. The plant also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
