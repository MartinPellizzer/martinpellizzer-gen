It is characterized by its hairy, silvery-green foliage and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies ciliosa is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems and leaves compared to other subspecies of Phacelia sericea. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
