    "intro": "Phacelia nemoralis var. oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside due to dense pubescence. Oregon phacelia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
