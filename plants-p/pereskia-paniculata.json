    "intro": "Pereskia paniculata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp, spiny structures called glochids. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the warm season, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its botanical structure includes a succulent stem with areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and branches. Pereskia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible fruits it produces."
