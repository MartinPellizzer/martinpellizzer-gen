It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually greenish or pale brown in color.
