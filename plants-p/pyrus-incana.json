    "intro": "Pyrus incana, commonly known as the rough pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Pyrus incana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
