    "intro": "Polypodium deltoideophyllum, commonly known as the delta-leaf wall fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
