    "intro": "Polyphragmon mutabile, commonly known as the variable polyphragmon, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its biennial growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers. Its name, \"mutabile,\" reflects its variable appearance, which can change depending on environmental conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
