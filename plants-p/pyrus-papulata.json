    "intro": "Pyrus papulata, commonly known as the rough-leaved pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its rough, papery texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish fruits. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pyrus papulata is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
