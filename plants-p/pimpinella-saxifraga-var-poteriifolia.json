    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. poteriifolia, commonly known as the rock pepper or mountain rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
