    "intro": "Pilosella iserana subsp. confinium, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger leaves compared to other Pilosella species. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in mountainous environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
