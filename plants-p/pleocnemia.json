    "intro": "Pleocnemia, commonly known as the \"giant fern,\" is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Pleocnemia species have a robust rhizome system that helps them anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
