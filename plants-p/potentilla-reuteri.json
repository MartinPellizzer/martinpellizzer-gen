    "intro": "Potentilla reuteri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it often forms dense mats or cushions. Potentilla reuteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
