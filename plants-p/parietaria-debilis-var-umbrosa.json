    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade parietaria, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to shaded forest environments. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland understories."
