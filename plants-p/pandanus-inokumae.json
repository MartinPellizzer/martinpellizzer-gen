It is native to the tropical regions of Indonesia, particularly the Moluccas, and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which are often used in traditional crafts and rituals. Its robust and fibrous leaves make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, including coastal areas. The plant's unique morphology and cultural significance contribute to its importance in both ecological and anthropological contexts."
