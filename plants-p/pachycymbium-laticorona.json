    "intro": "Pachycymbium laticorona, commonly known as the broad-crowned cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
