    "intro": "Polypodium punctatum subsp. subirideum, commonly known as the Indian brake fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and produce roots that help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
