    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. angustisecta, commonly known as silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white underside on the leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
