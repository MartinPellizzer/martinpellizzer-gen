    "intro": "Paronychia arabica subsp. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti pincushion, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit composed of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions and is often found growing in rocky soils."
