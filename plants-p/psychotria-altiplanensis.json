    "intro": "Psychotria altiplanensis, commonly known as the Andean Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
