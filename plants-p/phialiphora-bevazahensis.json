    "intro": "Phialiphora bevazahensis, commonly known as the Bevazahensis moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth pattern, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
