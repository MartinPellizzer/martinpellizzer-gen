    "intro": "Prunus padus var. commutata, commonly known as the white-flowered bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
