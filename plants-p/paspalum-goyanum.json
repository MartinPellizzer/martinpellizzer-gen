    "intro": "Paspalum goyanum, commonly known as the Goianinha grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Paspalum goyanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
