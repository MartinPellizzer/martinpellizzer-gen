    "intro": "Pogalis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pogalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The woolly texture of its leaves helps to reduce water loss, making it adapted to arid environments."
