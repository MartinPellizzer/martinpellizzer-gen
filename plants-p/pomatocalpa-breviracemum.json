    "intro": "Pomatocalpa breviracemum, commonly known as the short-stemmed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a short raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
