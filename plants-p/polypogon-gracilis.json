    "intro": "Polypogon gracilis, commonly known as slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Polypogon gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
