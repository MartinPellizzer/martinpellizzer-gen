    "intro": "Primula acaulis var. brevistyla, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of basal leaves that form a cushion-like structure, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is prized in rock gardens and alpine habitats for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
