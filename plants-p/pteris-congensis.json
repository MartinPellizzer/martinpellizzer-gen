    "intro": "Pteris congensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green and divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris congensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
