    "intro": "Polystichum cyphochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, evergreen fronds that are typically narrow and deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
