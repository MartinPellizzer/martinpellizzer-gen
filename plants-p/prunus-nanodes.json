It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often arching branches. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. Its leaves are ovate with finely toothed margins and turn yellow in autumn. Prunus nanodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blossoms and berries."
