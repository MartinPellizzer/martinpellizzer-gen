It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature intricate patterns of red, blue, and white, often with prominent stamens and a crown-like structure. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Passiflora megacoriacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
