    "intro": "Pteris armata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris armata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
