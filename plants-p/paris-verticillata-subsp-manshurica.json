    "intro": "Paris verticillata subsp. manshurica, commonly known as the Siberian basket lily, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
