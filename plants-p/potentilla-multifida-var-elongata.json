    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. elongata, commonly known as the longleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately divided, with multiple lobes that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
