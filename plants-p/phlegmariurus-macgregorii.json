    "intro": "Phlegmariurus macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, creeping evergreen plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, typically in shaded, moist environments. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain the spores for reproduction. Phlegmariurus macgregorii is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
