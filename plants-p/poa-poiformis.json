    "intro": "Poa poiformis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing protection against strong winds and UV radiation. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Poa poiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
