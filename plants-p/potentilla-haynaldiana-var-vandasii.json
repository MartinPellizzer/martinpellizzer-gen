    "intro": "Potentilla haynaldiana var. vandasii, commonly known as the Vandasii cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy underside, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine plant collections."
