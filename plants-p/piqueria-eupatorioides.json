    "intro": "Piqueria eupatorioides, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
