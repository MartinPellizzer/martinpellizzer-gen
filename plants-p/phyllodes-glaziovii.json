    "intro": "Phyllodes glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are typically green, narrow, and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
