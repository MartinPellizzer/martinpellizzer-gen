    "intro": "Plantago hillii, commonly known as the Sierra plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments such as mountain slopes and dry meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are clustered in dense, terminal clusters. The plant is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
