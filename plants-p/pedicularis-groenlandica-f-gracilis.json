    "intro": "Pedicularis groenlandica f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its small, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist environments such as tundra and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
