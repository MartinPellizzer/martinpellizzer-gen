Ptychosperma species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing near coastal areas or in wetlands. They are known for their ability to thrive in saline or waterlogged soils, making them important in coastal ecosystems. The genus includes several species, some of which are used for their ornamental value or traditional purposes."
