    "intro": "Palicourea cuspidata subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
