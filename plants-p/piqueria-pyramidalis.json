    "intro": "Piqueria pyramidalis, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its dense, spiny branches and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and strong, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Piqueria pyramidalis is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion in dry landscapes."
