    "intro": "Penducella dactyla, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces trumpet-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found growing along sandy shores and rocky outcrops. Penducella dactyla is adapted to saline and coastal environments, showing resistance to salt spray and wind. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dune soils."
