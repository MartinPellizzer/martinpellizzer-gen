It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. While not widely cultivated for its fruits, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
