    "intro": "Paspalum lehmannianum, commonly known as Lehmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in moist or wetland habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions."
