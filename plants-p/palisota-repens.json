    "intro": "Palisota repens, commonly known as creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It has slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are often overlooked. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a slightly hairy texture. Palisota repens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
