    "intro": "Polystichum acutipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
