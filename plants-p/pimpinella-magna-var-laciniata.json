    "intro": "Pimpinella magna var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf giant cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
