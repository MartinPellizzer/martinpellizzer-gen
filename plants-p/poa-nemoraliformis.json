    "intro": "Poa nemoraliformis, commonly known as the woodland bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 30 cm tall, with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa nemoraliformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
