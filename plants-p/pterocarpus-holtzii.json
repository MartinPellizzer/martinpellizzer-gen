    "intro": "Pterocarpus holtzii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, including Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown timber, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody pods. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
