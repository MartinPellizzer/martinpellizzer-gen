    "intro": "Poa shumushuensis, commonly known as Shumushu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
