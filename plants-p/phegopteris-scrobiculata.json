    "intro": "Phegopteris scrobiculata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded lobes that give it a unique, lacy appearance. Phegopteris scrobiculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
