The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense clumps, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
