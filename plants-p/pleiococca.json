    "intro": "Pleiococca, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is native to the wetlands of Asia, particularly India and China, where it thrives in shallow waters. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are broad and round, floating on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The botanical features of Pleiococca have made it a symbol of purity and spiritual enlightenment in various cultures."
