    "intro": "Peplis portula f. aquatica, commonly known as water peplis, is a variant of the peplis plant that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the waterline. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in wetlands. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
