    "intro": "Polypogon maritimus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal flats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
