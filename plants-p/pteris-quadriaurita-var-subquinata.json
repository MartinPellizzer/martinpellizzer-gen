    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. subquinata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the quadrifoliate water fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a golden hue on the underside. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces short, upright fronds with a pinnate structure. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
