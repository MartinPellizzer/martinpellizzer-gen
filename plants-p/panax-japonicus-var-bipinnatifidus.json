    "intro": "Panax japonicus var. bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng or Korean ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Its roots, which are the primary part used medicinally, are known for their complex chemical composition. This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and adaptogenic properties."
