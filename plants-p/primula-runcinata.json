    "intro": "Primula runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces showy blooms in early spring. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitats."
