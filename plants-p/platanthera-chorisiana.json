    "intro": "Platanthera chorisiana, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, slender stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single spike of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
