    "intro": "Potentilla uniflora, commonly known as the singleflower cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and high elevations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
