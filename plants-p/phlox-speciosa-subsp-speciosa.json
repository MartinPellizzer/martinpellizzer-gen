    "intro": "Phlox speciosa subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the showy phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mound-like growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage is evergreen in warmer climates but dies back in winter, revealing a basal rosette of leaves."
