    "intro": "Pandanus botryoides, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces long, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, contributing to its overall structural form. Pandanus botryoides thrives in coastal and wetland environments, adapting well to humid and saline conditions."
