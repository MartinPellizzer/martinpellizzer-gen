    "intro": "Portulaca werdermannii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in some regions."
