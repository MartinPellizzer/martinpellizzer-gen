    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. masamunei, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces slender, erect stems with a single, showy flower that is often pale yellow or greenish-white. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
