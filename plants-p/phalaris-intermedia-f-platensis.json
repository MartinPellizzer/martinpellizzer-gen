    "intro": "Phalaris intermedia f. platensis, commonly known as the flat-leaved glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
