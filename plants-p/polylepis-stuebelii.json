    "intro": "Polylepis stuebelii, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This tree is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and distinctive crown shape, which help it withstand the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It plays an important ecological role in Andean ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various endemic species. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Polylepis stuebelii is considered a vulnerable species."
