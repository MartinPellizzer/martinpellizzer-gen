    "intro": "Pseudoraphis aspera, commonly known as the rough pseudoraphis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Pseudoraphis aspera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
