It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
