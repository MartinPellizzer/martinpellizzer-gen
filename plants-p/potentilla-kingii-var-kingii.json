The plant has five leaflets arranged in a compact rosette, with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
