    "intro": "Paspalum tenerum, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Paspalum tenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
