    "intro": "Psammisia grandiflora, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Psammisia grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
