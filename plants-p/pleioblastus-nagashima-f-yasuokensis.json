It features slender, gracefully arching culms that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a specimen plant due to its elegant growth habit and seasonal color changes."
