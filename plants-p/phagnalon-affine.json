It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
