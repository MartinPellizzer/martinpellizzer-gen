    "intro": "Pinus saportae, commonly known as the San Diego pine, is a species of pine native to the coastal areas of southern California. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The tree has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and grow in clusters of five. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. This species is adapted to the mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers of its native environment."
