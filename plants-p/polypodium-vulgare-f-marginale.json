    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. marginale, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions in Europe and Asia. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. The varietal form 'marginale' is distinguished by its slightly broader and more elongated fronds compared to the typical form."
