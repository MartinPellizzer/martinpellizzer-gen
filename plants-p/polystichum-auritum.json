    "intro": "Polystichum auritum, commonly known as the auriculate fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The fronds often have auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
