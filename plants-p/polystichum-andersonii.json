    "intro": "Polystichum andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Polystichum andersonii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
