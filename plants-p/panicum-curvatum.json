    "intro": "Panicum curvatum, commonly known as curly panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wiry, curling seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Panicum curvatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
