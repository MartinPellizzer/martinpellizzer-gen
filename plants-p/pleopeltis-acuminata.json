    "intro": "Pleopeltis acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
