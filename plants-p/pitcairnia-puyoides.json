    "intro": "Pitcairnia puyoides, commonly known as the Puy Valley pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Pitcairnia puyoides is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in cloud forest ecosystems."
