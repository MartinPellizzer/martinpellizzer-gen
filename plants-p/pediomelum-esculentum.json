It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are succulent and can be eaten raw or cooked, making it a valuable forage plant. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited distribution and specific growing conditions."
