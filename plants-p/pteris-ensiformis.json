    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Pteris ensiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
