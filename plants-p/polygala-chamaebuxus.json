    "intro": "Polygala chamaebuxus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
