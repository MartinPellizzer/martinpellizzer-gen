    "intro": "Philodendron ensifolium subsp. colonense, commonly known as the Colombian swordleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and pointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This species is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
