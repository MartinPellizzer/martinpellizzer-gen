    "intro": "Pinus fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, purple-coned seed cones that release winged seeds in the fall. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. The Fraser fir is often found in high-elevation forests and is a key component of the Appalachian ecosystem."
