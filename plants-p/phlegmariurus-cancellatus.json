    "intro": "Phlegmariurus cancellatus, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped thallus with a pale to dark green or yellowish upper surface. The lower surface is usually white to cream, covered in small, rounded pores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
