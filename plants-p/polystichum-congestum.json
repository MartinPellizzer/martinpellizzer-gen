    "intro": "Polystichum congestum, commonly known as the dense fern or clustered shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed, giving it a compact and lush appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor into the soil while absorbing nutrients. Polystichum congestum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
