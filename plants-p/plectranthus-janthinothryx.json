    "intro": "Plectranthus janthinothryx, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance, making it highly sought after in horticulture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or violet, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is popular in both garden landscapes and as a potted plant."
