    "intro": "Prestonia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian trumpet vine, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its long, woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often with a red throat, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
