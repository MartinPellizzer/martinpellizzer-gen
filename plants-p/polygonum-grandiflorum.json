    "intro": "Polygonum grandiflorum, commonly known as the largeflower knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Polygonum grandiflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
