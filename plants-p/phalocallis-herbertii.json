    "intro": "Phalocallis herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's phalocallis, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and Angola. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
