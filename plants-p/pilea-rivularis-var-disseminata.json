    "intro": "Pilea rivularis var. disseminata, commonly known as the creeping pilea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a light green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common sight in wetland areas."
