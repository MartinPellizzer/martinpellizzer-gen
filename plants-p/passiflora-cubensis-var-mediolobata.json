    "intro": "Passiflora cubensis var. mediolobata, commonly known as the Jamaican passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers with a crown of filaments and a distinctive blue-violet center. The plant produces edible, tropical berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tart flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite long. This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
