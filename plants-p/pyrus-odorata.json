    "intro": "Pyrus odorata, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by sweet, aromatic fruits. The fruit has a thin, yellowish skin and a juicy, sweet flesh with a slight tartness. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in gardens and orchards."
