    "intro": "Pterolepis fragilis, commonly known as the brittleleaf pterolepis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its fragility and limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare species with specific ecological requirements. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and over-collection."
