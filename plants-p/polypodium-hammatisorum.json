    "intro": "Polypodium hammatisorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium hammatisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
