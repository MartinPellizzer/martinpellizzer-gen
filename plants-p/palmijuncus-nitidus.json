The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
