It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are arranged in spikes along the stem. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and healing properties. This species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
