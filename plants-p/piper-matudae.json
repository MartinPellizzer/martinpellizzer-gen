    "intro": "Piper matudae, commonly known as the Matudae pepper or Matudae pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or ascend trees. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a distinct aromatic scent. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and the plant produces tiny, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
