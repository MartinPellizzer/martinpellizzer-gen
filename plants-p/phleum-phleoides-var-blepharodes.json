    "intro": "Phleum phleoides var. blepharodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and dense growth, it can serve as a valuable ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
