    "intro": "Paspalum laeviglume, commonly known as smooth false brome, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Paspalum laeviglume is often found in regions with temperate to subtropical climates."
