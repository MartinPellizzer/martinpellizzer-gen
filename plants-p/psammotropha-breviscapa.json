    "intro": "Psammotropha breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has succulent leaves that help it conserve water, and its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Native to regions of southern Africa, it is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas."
