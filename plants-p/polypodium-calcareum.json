    "intro": "Polypodium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks where it can access moisture and nutrients. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a narrow, elongated shape and a central vein. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium calcareum is well adapted to calcareous substrates, which contribute to its common name."
