    "intro": "Picea abies f. remontii, commonly known as the Norway spruce form remontii, is a botanical variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, often exhibiting a more open and irregular branching pattern compared to the typical Norway spruce. This form is typically found in specific ecological niches, such as rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage is generally similar to that of the parent species, with needle-like leaves and a conical shape. The plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its distinct morphology and potential for ornamental use."
