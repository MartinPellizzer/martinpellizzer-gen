    "intro": "Peperomia cubugonana, commonly known as the Cubugonan peperomia, is a rare species native to the Philippines. It is a small, compact plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
