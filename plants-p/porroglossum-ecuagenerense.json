It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
