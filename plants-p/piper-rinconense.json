    "intro": "Piper rinconense, commonly known as the Rinc\u00f3n pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, containing a spicy, pungent substance similar to other peppers in the genus Piper. It is often found growing in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The botanical features of Piper rinconense make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ethnobotanical study."
