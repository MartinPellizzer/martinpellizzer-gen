    "intro": "Platycoryne elegantula, commonly known as the elegant flat-leaf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, elongated leaves that are often folded or rolled, a characteristic adaptation for conserving moisture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
