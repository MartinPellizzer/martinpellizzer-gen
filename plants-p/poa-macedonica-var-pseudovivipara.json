    "intro": "Poa macedonica var. pseudovivipara, commonly known as the Macedonian meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and somewhat hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variant is notable for its potential to exhibit vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant."
