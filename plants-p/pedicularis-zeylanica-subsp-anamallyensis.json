    "intro": "Pedicularis zeylanica subsp. anamallyensis, commonly known as the Anamalai mountain lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and produces striking red or pink tubular flowers. It has lanceolate leaves and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
