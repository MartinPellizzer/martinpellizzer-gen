    "intro": "Pyrus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty fruit surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Pyrus bullatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic qualities. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates."
