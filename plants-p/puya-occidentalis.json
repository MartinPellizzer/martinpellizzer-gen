    "intro": "Puya occidentalis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in the spring. Puya occidentalis is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and can survive in rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
