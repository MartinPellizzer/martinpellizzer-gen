    "intro": "Pandanophyllum squamatum, commonly known as the silverleaf pandan, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a typical feature of the Araceae family. The leaves are used in traditional practices and can be cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance."
