It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. It produces small, round berries that are yellow when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.
