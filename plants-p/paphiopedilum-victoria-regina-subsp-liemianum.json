    "intro": "Paphiopedilum victoria-regina subsp. liemianum, commonly known as the Liemianum lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized structure for trapping pollinators. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with thick, fleshy roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, green, and pink, with intricate patterns that enhance its visual appeal. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and partial shade, to thrive."
