    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. One notable feature is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent. This adaptation allows it to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor soils effectively."
