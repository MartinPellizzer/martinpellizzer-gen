    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa subsp. sudetorum, commonly known as the Sudeten hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It forms dense, mat-like growths with compact, tufted stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments."
