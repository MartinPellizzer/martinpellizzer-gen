    "intro": "Pilea betulifolia var. lineolata, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense rosette of waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a subtle reddish or pinkish hue along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique leaf patterns and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
