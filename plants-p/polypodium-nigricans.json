    "intro": "Polypodium nigricans, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like form. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
