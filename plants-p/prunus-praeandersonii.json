It is characterized by its small, dark red to black fruits and its ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces delicate white flowers in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
