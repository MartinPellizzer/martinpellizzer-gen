    "intro": "Pilea squamosa var. sparsa, commonly known as the silver pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive silvery-white coating on the upper surface. The leaves are oval to rounded, with a slightly serrated edge, and they emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance when touched. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale blue or white berries. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
