    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. typicum, commonly known as bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Bracken is known for its ability to form dense stands, which can dominate certain ecosystems."
