    "intro": "Polypodium meyenianum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Polypodium meyenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
