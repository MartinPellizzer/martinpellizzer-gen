    "intro": "Psoralea patersoniae, commonly known as the Paterson's psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea patersoniae is often found in coastal areas and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution."
