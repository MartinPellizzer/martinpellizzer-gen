    "intro": "Polemonium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and naturalized landscapes."
