It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Parosela pilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms."
