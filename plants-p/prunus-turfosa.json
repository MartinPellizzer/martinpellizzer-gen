    "intro": "Prunus turfosa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features compact, upright growth with dense foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
