    "intro": "Plantago ramosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by elongated, three-lobed seed capsules. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive fuzzy appearance. Plantago ramosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
