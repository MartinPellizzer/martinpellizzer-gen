    "intro": "Phaulothamnus spinescens, commonly known as the spiny dune grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phaulothamnus spinescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
