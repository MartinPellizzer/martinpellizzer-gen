    "intro": "Prunus rufa var. rufa, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a dense, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
