    "intro": "Parinari tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parinari, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellow or orange fruits. Its bark is smooth and light brown, often marked with lenticels, and the wood is valued for its lightweight and durability. Parinari tenuifolia is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
