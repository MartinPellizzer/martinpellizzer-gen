    "intro": "Pitcairnia killipiana var. viridis, commonly known as the emerald pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
