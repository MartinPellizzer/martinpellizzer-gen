    "intro": "Pittosporum loniceroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
