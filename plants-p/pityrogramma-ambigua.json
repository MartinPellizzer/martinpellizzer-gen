    "intro": "Pityrogramma ambigua, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a small, perennial fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize damp soil and rocky areas effectively."
