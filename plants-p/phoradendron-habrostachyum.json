    "intro": "Phoradendron habrostachyum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropics. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the health of its host trees."
