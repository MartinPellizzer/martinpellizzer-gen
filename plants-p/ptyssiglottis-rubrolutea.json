    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis rubrolutea, commonly known as the red-and-yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red upper surface and a lighter, often yellowish underside. This lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and tropical regions. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner. Ptyssiglottis rubrolutea is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
