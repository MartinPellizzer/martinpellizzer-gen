    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. arvense, commonly known as field pea, is a wild variety of the pea plant native to Europe and Asia. It is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in agricultural fields. It has small white or pink flowers and is adapted to temperate climates. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated counterpart, Pisum sativum var. sativum, but it plays a role in ecological systems as a weed and a potential forage species."
