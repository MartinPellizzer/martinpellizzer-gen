    "intro": "Parosela lasiostachya var. involuta, commonly known as the curled spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, arranged in a dense spike. This variant is distinguished by its involute (rolled) bracts, which give it its specific name."
