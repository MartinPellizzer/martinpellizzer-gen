    "intro": "Prenanthes hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Prenanthes hookeri is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a rare species in some regions."
