    "intro": "Paullinia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, spiny fruits resembling a large, hairy citrus. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
