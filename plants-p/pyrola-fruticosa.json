    "intro": "Pyrola fruticosa, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils in shaded forest environments. Pyrola fruticosa is also known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
