    "intro": "Pyrethrum armenum, commonly known as Armenian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Pyrethrum armenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
