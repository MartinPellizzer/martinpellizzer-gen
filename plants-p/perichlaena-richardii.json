    "intro": "Perichlaena richardii, commonly known as the Richard's spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
