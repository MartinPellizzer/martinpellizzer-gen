    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. septemsecta, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically branched and can have a woody base, while the leaves are pinnately divided into seven segments, a key feature of the subvariety. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
