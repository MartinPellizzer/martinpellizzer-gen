    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petioled cherry laurel, is a rare and unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaf petioles, which distinguish it from typical Prunus species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries in summer. It is typically found in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
