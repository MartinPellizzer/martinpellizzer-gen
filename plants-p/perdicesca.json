    "intro": "Perdicesca, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and valuable tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and heart-shaped leaves, which are adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. Its unique appearance and historical significance make it a subject of both ecological and cultural interest."
