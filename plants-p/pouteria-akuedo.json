    "intro": "Pouteria akuedo, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific bees. The tree's most notable feature is its hard-shelled fruit, which contains a single large seed known as the Brazil nut. The plant belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is valued for its economic and ecological importance. Its growth is slow, and it can live for centuries, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem."
