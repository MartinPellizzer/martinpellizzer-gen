    "intro": "Pachypodium rosulatum f. stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant features narrow, spiny leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the stems. This variant is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and striking appearance."
