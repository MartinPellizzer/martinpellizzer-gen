    "intro": "Pombalia brevis, commonly known as the shortleaf pombalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact stature and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss, Pombalia brevis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
