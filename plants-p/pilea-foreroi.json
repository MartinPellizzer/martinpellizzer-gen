    "intro": "Pilea foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's Chinese evergreen, is a compact, upright herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves with a slightly curled margin, giving it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, red berries, though these are not typically seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Pilea foreroi is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
