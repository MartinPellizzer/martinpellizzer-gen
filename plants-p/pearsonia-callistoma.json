    "intro": "Pearsonia callistoma, commonly known as the New Zealand sea holly, is a coastal plant native to New Zealand. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes. Pearsonia callistoma is an important part of New Zealand's coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to dune formation."
