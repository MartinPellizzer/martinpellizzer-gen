    "intro": "Polypodium reinwardtii, commonly known as the reinwardt's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in its survival in low-light conditions."
