    "intro": "Psilochenia acuminata subsp. pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered psilochenia, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
