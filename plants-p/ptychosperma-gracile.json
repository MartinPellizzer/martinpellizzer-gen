    "intro": "Ptychosperma gracile, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange outer covering, which is edible when ripe. Ptychosperma gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
