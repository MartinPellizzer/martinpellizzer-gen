    "intro": "Pinus georginae, commonly known as the Georgina pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against fire and drought. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems."
