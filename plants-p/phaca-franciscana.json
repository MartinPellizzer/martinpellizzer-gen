    "intro": "Phaca franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca franciscana is considered a vulnerable species."
