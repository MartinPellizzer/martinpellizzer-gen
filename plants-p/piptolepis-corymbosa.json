    "intro": "Piptolepis corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Piptolepis corymbosa is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and birds."
