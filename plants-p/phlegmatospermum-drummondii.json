    "intro": "Phlegmatospermum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's phlegmatosperm, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the order Phlegmariopales. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a network of filaments. This species is characterized by its ability to absorb water and nutrients directly through its surface, a trait common among mosses and liverworts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
