    "intro": "Pulicaria paludosa subsp. inuloides, commonly known as the marsh ragwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically features silver-gray foliage with woolly hairs, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rosette growth form with basal leaves that are often decurrent, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive characteristics."
