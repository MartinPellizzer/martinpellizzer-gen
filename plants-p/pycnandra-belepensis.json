It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptical in shape, with a slightly waxy texture. This plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine in local communities."
