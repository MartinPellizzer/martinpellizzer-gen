    "intro": "Potentilla norvegica var. hirsuta, commonly known as the Norwegian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with five leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
