    "intro": "Periphanes crispa, commonly known as the crinkled periphanes, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are covered in fine, wavy hairs, giving them a crinkled appearance. Periphanes crispa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
