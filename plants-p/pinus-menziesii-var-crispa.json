    "intro": "Pinus menziesii var. crispa, commonly known as the curly pine, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled or twisted needles, which give it a unique appearance compared to the straight needles of the standard variety. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its cones are woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
