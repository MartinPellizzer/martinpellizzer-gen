    "intro": "Potentilla thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has dark green, serrated leaves and produces woody stems that become more prominent with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
