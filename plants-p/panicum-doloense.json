    "intro": "Panicum doloense, commonly known as the doloense grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along the edges of woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
