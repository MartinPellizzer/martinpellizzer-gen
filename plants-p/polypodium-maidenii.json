    "intro": "Polypodium maidenii, commonly known as the Maiden's polypody, is a fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium maidenii is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
