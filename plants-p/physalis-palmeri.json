It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its inflated, spiny calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. The botanical features of Physalis palmeri make it well-adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
