    "intro": "Prosthechea linkiana, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Prosthechea linkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
