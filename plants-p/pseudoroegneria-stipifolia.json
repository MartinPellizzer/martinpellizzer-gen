    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria stipifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to survive in high-altitude environments. Pseudoroegneria stipifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
