    "intro": "Polychilos mariae, commonly known as the Marie's polychilos, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tubular and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, showy flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polychilos mariae is considered a species of conservation concern."
