    "intro": "Panicum aciculare var. ovinum, commonly known as sheep's barley grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This species is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
