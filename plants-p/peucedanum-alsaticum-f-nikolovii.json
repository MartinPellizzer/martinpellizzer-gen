    "intro": "Peucedanum alsaticum f. nikolovii, commonly known as the Balkan cow parsley, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive parsley-like scent, while its white flowers bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
