    "intro": "Platyopuntia soehrensii var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Prickly Pear, is a cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually ephemeral, appearing only after rainfall and withering quickly. This variation is notable for its adaptability to extreme drought conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
