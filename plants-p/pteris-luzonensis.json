    "intro": "Pteris luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Pteris luzonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
