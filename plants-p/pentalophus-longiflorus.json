It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in compound umbels, which attract various pollinators.
