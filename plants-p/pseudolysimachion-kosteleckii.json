    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion kosteleckii, commonly known as the Kostelecky's pseudolysimachion, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
