    "intro": "Papaver davuricum, commonly known as the Siberian poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bright red, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Papaveraceae family, known for its alkaloid-rich species."
