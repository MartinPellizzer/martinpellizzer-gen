It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Pandanus yoshioi thrives in humid, coastal environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
