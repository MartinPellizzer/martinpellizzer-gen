    "intro": "Populus henryana, commonly known as Henry's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Populus henryana is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along streams."
