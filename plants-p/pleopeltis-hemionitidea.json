It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study. The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions highlights its adaptability to diverse habitats."
