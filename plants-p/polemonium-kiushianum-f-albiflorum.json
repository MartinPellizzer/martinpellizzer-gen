    "intro": "Polemonium kiushianum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower polemonium, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are predominantly white, with some pink or purple hues, making it visually striking. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
