    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and capable of rapid vegetative propagation, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contribute to its widespread distribution."
