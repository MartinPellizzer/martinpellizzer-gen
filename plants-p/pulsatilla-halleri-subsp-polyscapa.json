    "intro": "Pulsatilla halleri subsp. polyscapa, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its multiple scapes, which contribute to its common name."
