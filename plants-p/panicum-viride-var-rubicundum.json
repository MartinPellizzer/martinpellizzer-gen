    "intro": "Panicum viride var. rubicundum, commonly known as green panic grass with red stems, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that often display a striking red or reddish hue, especially under certain environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common ornamental and forage plant in warm climates. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in agricultural and ecological contexts."
