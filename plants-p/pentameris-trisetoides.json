    "intro": "Pentameris trisetoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pentameris trisetoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
