    "intro": "Polystichopsis puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered and covered by a thin, membranous indusium. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
