    "intro": "Pleopeltis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while supporting its lush, fern-like foliage. Pleopeltis bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
