    "intro": "Palicourea crocea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered palicourea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller, more delicate flowers and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
