    "intro": "Polypodium menisciicarpon, commonly known as the Meniscus fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The botanical features of this fern make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
