It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
