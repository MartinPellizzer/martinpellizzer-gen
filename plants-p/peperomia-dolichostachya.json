    "intro": "Peperomia dolichostachya, commonly known as the long-stalked peperomia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a compact shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia dolichostachya is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
