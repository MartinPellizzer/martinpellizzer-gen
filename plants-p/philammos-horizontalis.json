    "intro": "Philammos horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with horizontal rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pinkish flowers during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Philammos horizontalis is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
