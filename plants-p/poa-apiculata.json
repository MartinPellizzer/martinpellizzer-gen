    "intro": "Poa apiculata, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
