    "intro": "Pseudosasa altiligulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bamboo, is a species of grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Pseudosasa altiligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
