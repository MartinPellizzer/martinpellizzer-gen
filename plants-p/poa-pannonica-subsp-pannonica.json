    "intro": "Poa pannonica subsp. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland and grassland habitats."
