    "intro": "Paspalum sumatrense, commonly known as the Sumatran paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
