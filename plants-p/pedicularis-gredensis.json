    "intro": "Pedicularis gredensis, commonly known as the Gredens mountain lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Swiss Alps. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant is characterized by its reddish or purple flowers and leafless stems, which are adaptations to its harsh alpine environment. It typically grows in rocky and sunny habitats, often in open meadows or on scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
