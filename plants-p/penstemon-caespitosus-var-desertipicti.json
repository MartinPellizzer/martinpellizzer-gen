    "intro": "Penstemon caespitosus var. desertipicti, commonly known as the desert beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to drought and resistance to pests make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
