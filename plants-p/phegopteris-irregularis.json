    "intro": "Phegopteris irregularis, commonly known as the irregular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a unique appearance. The plant is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Phegopteris irregularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
