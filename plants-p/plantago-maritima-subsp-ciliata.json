    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. ciliata, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. This species is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including wind and salt spray."
