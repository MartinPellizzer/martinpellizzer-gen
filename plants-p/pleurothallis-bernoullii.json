    "intro": "Pleurothallis bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's slipper orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble small slippers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
