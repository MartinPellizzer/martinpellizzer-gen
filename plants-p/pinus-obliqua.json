    "intro": "Pinus obliqua, commonly known as the oblique pine, is a species of conifer native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and typically hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in moist, cool climates with well-drained soil. Pinus obliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
