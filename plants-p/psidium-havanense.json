    "intro": "Psidium havanense, commonly known as the Cuban guanabana, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, inedible berries that are typically green when mature. Its fruit, though not widely consumed, has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
