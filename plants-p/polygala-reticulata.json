    "intro": "Polygala reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by insects, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species for pollinators. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and conservation efforts."
