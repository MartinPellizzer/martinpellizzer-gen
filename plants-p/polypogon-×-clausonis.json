    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 clausonis, commonly known as the hybrid false brome, is a grass species resulting from the cross between Polypogon monospillus and Polypogon borealis. It is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Botanically, it is notable for its hybrid origin and its role in ecological succession in disturbed environments."
