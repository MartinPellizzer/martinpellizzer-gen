    "intro": "Pteris grossiloba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris grossiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
