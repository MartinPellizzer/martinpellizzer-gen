It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped inflorescences that resemble a bottle brush, hence its common name. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Prosartes species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and distinctive floral structures."
