    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. revoluta, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, sprawling crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The tree's needles are typically blue-green in color and grow in bundles of five, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the tree for many years, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. This variant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with well-drained soils."
