It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, greenish-white berries. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
