    "intro": "Plethiosphace pratensis, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, with the bladders arranged in clusters along the stems. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
