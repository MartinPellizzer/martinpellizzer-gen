    "intro": "Polypodium contiguum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found growing on limestone or slate. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, serrated appearance. Polypodium contiguum is well adapted to shaded, humid environments and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
