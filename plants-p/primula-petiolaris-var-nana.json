    "intro": "Primula petiolaris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and have a rounded shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
