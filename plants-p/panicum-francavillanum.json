    "intro": "Panicum francavillanum, commonly known as the Frenchman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open woodland and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with tall, slender stems. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. Panicum francavillanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
