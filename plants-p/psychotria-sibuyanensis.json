    "intro": "Psychotria sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Sibuyan. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is often found in lowland to montane forest understories, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
