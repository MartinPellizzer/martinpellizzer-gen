    "intro": "Populus guzmanantlensis, commonly known as the Guzm\u00e1n's poplar, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its deciduous nature. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
