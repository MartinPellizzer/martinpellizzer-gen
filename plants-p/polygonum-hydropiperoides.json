It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a slightly peppery scent. Polygonum hydropiperoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
