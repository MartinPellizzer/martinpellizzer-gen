    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 fossae-rusticorum, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, naturally occurring hybrid between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are similar to those of its parent species. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
