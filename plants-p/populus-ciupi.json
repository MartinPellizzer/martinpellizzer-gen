    "intro": "Populus ciupi, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Populus ciupi is often used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and rapid growth in harsh environments."
