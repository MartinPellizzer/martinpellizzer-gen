    "intro": "Pelargonium zonale var. marginatum, commonly known as the margined geranium, is a hybrid geranium species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, rounded leaves with a pale green margin and a darker green center. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
