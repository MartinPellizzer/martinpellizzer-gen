    "intro": "Phymatodes longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Phymatodes longipes produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
