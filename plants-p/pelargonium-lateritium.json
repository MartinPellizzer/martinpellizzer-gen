    "intro": "Pelargonium lateritium, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Pelargonium lateritium is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
