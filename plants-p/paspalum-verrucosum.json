    "intro": "Paspalum verrucosum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Paspalum verrucosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
