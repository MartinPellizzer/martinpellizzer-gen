    "intro": "Psidium luridum, commonly known as the yellow guava, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a fragrant aroma. The fruit has a thin, leathery skin and a sweet, acidic pulp, making it a popular local food source. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas."
