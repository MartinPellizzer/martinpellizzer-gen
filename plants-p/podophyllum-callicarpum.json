    "intro": "Podophyllum callicarpum, commonly known as the scarlet gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright red, fleshy berries that are clustered in groups of three, giving it its common name. The plant has alternate, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, so they should be consumed with caution."
