    "intro": "Phthirusa maculata, commonly known as the spotted leaf bug, is a species of plant-feeding insect belonging to the family Coreidae. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted pattern on its body, which provides camouflage against its host plants. The plant it feeds on is typically a member of the Malvaceae family, such as cotton or hibiscus. Its feeding habits can cause damage to the leaves, leading to reduced growth and yield in cultivated plants. This insect is often found in warm, humid environments where its host plants thrive."
