    "intro": "Physalis franchetii var. bunyardii, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, urn-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature, encased in a papery calyx. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and shallow root systems for efficient moisture uptake. Its flowers are usually yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible, though tart, and has been used in traditional culinary practices by indigenous communities."
