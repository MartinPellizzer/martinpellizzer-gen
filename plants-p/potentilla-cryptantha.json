    "intro": "Potentilla cryptantha, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Potentilla cryptantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
