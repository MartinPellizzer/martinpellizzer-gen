    "intro": "Pabstiella calimanii, commonly known as the Calimanii orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as a small epiphytic or lithophytic orchid, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns and vivid colors that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Pabstiella calimanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
