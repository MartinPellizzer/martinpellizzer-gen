    "intro": "Polystichum pseudoaristatum, commonly known as the false aristotelia, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a dark green, glossy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typically in late summer to early autumn."
