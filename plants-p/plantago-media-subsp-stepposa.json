    "intro": "Plantago media subsp. stepposa, commonly known as the steppe plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
