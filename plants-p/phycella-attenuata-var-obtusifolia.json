    "intro": "Phycella attenuata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phycella, is a variant of the phycella genus within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often slightly lobed at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
