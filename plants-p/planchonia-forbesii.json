    "intro": "Planchonia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbe's planchonia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
