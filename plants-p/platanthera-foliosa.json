    "intro": "Platanthera foliosa, commonly known as the leafy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing along stream banks or in swampy areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. The species is considered rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
