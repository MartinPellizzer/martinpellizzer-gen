    "intro": "Poa alpigena var. colpodea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh alpine conditions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem diversity."
