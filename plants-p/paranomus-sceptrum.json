    "intro": "Paranomus sceptrum, commonly known as the sacred scepter, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections."
