    "intro": "Pyrrosia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia angustissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
