    "intro": "Psilostrophe gnaphalodes var. gnaphalodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wallaby tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to resprout from lignified stems after fire or grazing damage."
