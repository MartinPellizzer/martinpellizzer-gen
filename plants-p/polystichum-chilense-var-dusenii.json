    "intro": "Polystichum chilense var. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's sword fern, is a terrestrial fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and adaptable nature."
