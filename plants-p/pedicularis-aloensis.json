    "intro": "Pedicularis aloensis, commonly known as the Alpine Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to purple. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its specialized habitat, Pedicularis aloensis is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
