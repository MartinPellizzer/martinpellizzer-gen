    "intro": "Pinguicula jaraguana, commonly known as the Jaragua butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the humid forests of the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
