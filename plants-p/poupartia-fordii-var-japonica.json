    "intro": "Poupartia fordii var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves, and it is often found in forested or shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants."
