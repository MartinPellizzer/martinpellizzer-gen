    "intro": "Polygonum subcanum, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in wetland areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel."
