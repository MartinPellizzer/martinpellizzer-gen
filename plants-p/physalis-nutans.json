    "intro": "Physalis nutans, commonly known as the downy physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small, yellow-orange lantern. Native to South America, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the flowers are typically pale yellow with five petals. The fruit, known as a \"cape gooseberry,\" is edible and has a tangy, slightly sweet flavor."
