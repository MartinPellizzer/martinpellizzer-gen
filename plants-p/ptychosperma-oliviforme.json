    "intro": "Ptychosperma oliviforme, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates and is adapted to well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
