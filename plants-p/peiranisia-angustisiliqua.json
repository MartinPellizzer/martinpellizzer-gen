It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
