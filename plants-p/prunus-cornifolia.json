    "intro": "Prunus cornifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, though they are not as commonly consumed as other cherries. It blooms in early spring with clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. Prunus cornifolia thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
