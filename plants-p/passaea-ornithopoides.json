    "intro": "Passaea ornithopoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces numerous small, showy flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found growing on dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Passaea ornithopoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
