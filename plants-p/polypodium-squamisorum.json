    "intro": "Polypodium squamisorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into pinnate segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are produced in sori that are covered by a membranous indusium, a feature common among many ferns. Polypodium squamisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
