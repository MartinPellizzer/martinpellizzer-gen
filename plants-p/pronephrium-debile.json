    "intro": "Pronephrium debile, commonly known as the weak kidney fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and slightly hairy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Pronephrium debile prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
