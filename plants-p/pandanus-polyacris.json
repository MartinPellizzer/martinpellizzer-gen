    "intro": "Pandanus polyacris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Its fibrous leaves are valued for their durability and are used to make baskets, mats, and other woven items. Pandanus polyacris thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in swampy areas."
