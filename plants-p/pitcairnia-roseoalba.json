    "intro": "Pitcairnia roseoalba, commonly known as the pink-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which may serve to reduce water loss. Pitcairnia roseoalba thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
