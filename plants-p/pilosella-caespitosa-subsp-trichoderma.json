    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa subsp. trichoderma, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a somewhat lobed or toothed appearance. The subspecies trichoderma is distinguished by its more robust growth and increased hair density compared to other subspecies of Pilosella."
