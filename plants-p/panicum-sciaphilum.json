    "intro": "Panicum sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in low-light conditions, often found in shaded forest understories or moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom during the wet season. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its growth habit makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in shaded habitats."
