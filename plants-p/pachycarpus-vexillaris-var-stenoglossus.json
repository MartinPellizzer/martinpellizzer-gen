It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
