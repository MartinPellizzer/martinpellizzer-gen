    "intro": "Pugetia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous pugetia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is known for its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Pugetia resinosa is also notable for its fragrant leaves and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds. Its resinous sap has historically been used by Indigenous peoples for various practical and ceremonial purposes."
