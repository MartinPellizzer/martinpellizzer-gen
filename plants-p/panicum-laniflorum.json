    "intro": "Panicum laniflorum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and soft, silky hairs covering its leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive, feathery appearance and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
