    "intro": "Pereskia guamacho, commonly known as the Guamacho cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered with a layer of pale green bark, resembling a tree rather than a typical cactus. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pereskia guamacho is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils."
