    "intro": "Pleurothallis flammea, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers that are often brightly colored, with a distinctive red or orange hue. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its striking appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
