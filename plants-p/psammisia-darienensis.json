    "intro": "Psammisia darienensis, commonly known as the Darien sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Psammisia darienensis is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in coastal and desert environments."
