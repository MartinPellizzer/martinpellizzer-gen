    "intro": "Pilosella glomerabilis, commonly known as the clustered hairvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Pilosella glomerabilis is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its hairy stems and leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in dry environments."
