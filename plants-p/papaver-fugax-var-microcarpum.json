    "intro": "Papaver fugax var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to deep red, and its short, upright stem. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
