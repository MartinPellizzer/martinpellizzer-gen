    "intro": "Pitcairnia guzmanioides, commonly known as the Guzmana's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Pitcairnia guzmanioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
