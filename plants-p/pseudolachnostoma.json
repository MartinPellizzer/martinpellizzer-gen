    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma, commonly known as the false lichen moth, is a genus of moths belonging to the family Erebidae. These insects are not plants, so they do not have botanical characteristics. However, their larvae feed on lichens, which are composite organisms made up of fungi and algae. The interaction between Pseudolachnostoma and lichens is an example of herbivory in ecological systems. This relationship highlights the complex interdependencies within natural ecosystems."
