    "intro": "Pediocactus robustior, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the apex of the stem. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Pediocactus robustior is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
