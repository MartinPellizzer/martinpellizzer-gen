    "intro": "Panicum maximum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a tall, robust grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to hot, humid climates and is often found in grasslands and savannas. It is a valuable forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional content and rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
