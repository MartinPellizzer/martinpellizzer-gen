    "intro": "Polycarpon prostratum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate nightshade, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a rough or hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
