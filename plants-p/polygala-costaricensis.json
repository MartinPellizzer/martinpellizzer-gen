    "intro": "Polygala costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
