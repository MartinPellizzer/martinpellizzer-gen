    "intro": "Plantago marginata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers sunny, open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous root system makes it resilient and adaptable to disturbed environments."
