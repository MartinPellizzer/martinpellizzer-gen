    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus mammillarioides, commonly known as the mammillaria-like pyrrhocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in short, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
