    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. salsa, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
