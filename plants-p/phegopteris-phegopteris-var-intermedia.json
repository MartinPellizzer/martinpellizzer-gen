    "intro": "Phegopteris phegopteris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Phegopteris. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are usually 30\u201360 cm long, with a soft, feathery appearance. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it a common species in temperate and subtropical regions."
