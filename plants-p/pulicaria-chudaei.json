    "intro": "Pulicaria chudaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pulicaria chudaei is often found in coastal areas and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
