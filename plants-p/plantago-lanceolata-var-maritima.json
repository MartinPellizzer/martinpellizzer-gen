    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. maritima, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Sea plantain is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats."
