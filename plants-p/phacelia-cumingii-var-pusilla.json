    "intro": "Phacelia cumingii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf phacelia, is a small annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its small, showy flowers attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
