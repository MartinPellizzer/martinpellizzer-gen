    "intro": "Psammisia globosa, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Psammisia globosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
