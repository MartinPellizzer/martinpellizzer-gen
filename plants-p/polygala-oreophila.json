    "intro": "Polygala oreophila, commonly known as the mountain polygala, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
