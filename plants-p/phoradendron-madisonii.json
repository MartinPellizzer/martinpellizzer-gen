It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white, fleshy berries. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.
