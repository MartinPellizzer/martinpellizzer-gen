    "intro": "Pellaea villosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive fuzzy texture that aids in moisture retention. Pellaea villosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability."
