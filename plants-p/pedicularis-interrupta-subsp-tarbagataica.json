    "intro": "Pedicularis interrupta subsp. tarbagataica, commonly known as the Tarbagatai lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with distinctive markings. It has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
