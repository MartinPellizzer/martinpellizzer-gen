    "intro": "Poa heterogama, commonly known as the variable meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, Poa heterogama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
