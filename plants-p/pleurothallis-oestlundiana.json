    "intro": "Pleurothallis oestlundiana, commonly known as the Oestlund's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range."
