    "intro": "Prunus padus var. glauca, commonly known as the white-flowered bird cherry, is a variant of the bird cherry species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the fruits are small, yellowish drupes that ripen in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
