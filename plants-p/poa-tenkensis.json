    "intro": "Poa tenkensis, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
