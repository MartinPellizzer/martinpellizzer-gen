    "intro": "Peperomia olivacea var. perlongispica, commonly known as the long-spined peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed capsules. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both home and office settings."
