    "intro": "Persica mammosa, commonly known as the mammosa peach, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by fuzzy, yellow fruits that ripen in late summer. Persica mammosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance. However, it is less commonly grown for its fruit compared to other peach varieties."
