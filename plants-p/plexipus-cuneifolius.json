The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible or medicinal properties. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often producing a striking contrast of colors that attract pollinators. The roots of Plexipus cuneifolius are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal remedies in certain regions.
