    "intro": "Pteris aculeata var. propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with closely spaced, sharp-pointed pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
