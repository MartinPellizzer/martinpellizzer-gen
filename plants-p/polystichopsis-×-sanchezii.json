    "intro": "Polystichopsis \u00d7 sanchezii, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Polystichopsis* species. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
