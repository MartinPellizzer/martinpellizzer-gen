    "intro": "Polypodium iboense, commonly known as the Ibo water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, forming dense, low-growing mats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
