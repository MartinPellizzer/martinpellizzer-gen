    "intro": "Purgosea punctata, commonly known as the spotted purgosea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to white, often with distinctive markings. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Purgosea punctata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
