    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped cones and narrow, needle-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in subalpine and alpine zones. The tree is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems in its native range."
