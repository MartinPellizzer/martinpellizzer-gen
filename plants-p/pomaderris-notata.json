    "intro": "Pomaderris notata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pomaderris, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and they emit a strong, distinctive scent when crushed. It produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract native wildlife."
