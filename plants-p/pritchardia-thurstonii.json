    "intro": "Pritchardia thurstonii, commonly known as the Thurston's palm, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Pritchardia thurstonii is considered a vulnerable species."
