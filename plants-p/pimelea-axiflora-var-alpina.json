It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky or sandy habitats. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. It is often found in open heathlands and is well-suited to poor, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
