    "intro": "Parabenzoin trilobum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy trilobum, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is native to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
