    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. eriophora, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. This species is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and gardens."
