    "intro": "Polypodium sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
