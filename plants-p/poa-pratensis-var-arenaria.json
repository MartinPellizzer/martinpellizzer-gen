    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. arenaria, commonly known as sandy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in sandy environments."
