    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. feei, commonly known as the Japanese bracken, is a variant of the common bracken that is native to East Asia. It is a fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
