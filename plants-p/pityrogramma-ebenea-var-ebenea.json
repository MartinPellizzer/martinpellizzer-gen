    "intro": "Pityrogramma ebenea var. ebenea, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a velvety texture. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
