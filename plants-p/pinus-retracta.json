    "intro": "Pinus retracta, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries in age. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions."
