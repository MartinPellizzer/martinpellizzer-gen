    "intro": "Polystichum setillosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum setillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
