    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca var. pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
