    "intro": "Pedilonum stolleanum, commonly known as the creeping stolone plant, is a unique species characterized by its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. This plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers, when present, are usually small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in certain horticultural settings."
