    "intro": "Philodendron scabrum, commonly known as the roughleaf philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often rough-textured leaves that can be either heart-shaped or arrow-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Philodendron scabrum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
