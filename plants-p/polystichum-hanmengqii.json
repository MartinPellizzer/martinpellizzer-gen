It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with a distinct, serrated edge. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
