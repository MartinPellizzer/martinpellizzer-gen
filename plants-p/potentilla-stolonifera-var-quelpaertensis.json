    "intro": "Potentilla stolonifera var. quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Korean cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Korea. It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and are covered in a soft, fuzzy layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
