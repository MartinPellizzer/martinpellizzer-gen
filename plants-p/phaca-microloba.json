It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Phaca microloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
