    "intro": "Poranthera ericoides, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly along coastal regions. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Poranthera ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
