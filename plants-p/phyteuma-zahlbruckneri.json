    "intro": "Phyteuma zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Zahlsbruckner's phyteuma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
