    "intro": "Pleurothallis misera, commonly known as the sad pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
