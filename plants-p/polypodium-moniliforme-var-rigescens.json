    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. rigescens, commonly known as the rigid horse-tail fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, segmented, spore-bearing fronds that resemble a horse\u2019s tail, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
