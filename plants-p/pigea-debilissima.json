    "intro": "Pigea debilissima, commonly known as the weak pigeon wort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Pigea debilissima is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in high-altitude environments."
