    "intro": "Panax serratus, commonly known as the serrated ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its roots, similar to those of Panax ginseng, are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax serratus is now considered a rare and endangered species."
