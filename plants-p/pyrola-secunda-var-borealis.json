    "intro": "Pyrola secunda var. borealis, commonly known as the northern wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its leaves are typically evergreen, remaining green throughout the winter, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more northern distribution compared to other pyrola species."
