    "intro": "Phyllanthus placentatus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Phyllanthus placentatus is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
