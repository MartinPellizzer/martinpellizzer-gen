    "intro": "Phreatia monticola, commonly known as the mountain phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and the presence of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Phreatia monticola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
