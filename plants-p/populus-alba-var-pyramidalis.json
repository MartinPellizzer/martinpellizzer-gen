    "intro": "Populus alba var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf white poplar, is a variant of the white poplar species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a distinct pyramidal growth habit, which gives it a more upright appearance compared to other poplar varieties. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common feature among poplar species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found along riverbanks and in moist, temperate climates. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal interest."
