    "intro": "Persea austin-smithii, commonly known as Austin-Smith's persimmon, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and camphor trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, lance-shaped leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-hued berry that ripens in the fall and is edible when fully mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
