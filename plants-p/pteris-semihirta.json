    "intro": "Pteris semihirta, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Pteris semihirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
