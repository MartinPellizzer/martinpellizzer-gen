    "intro": "Pinus morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison Island pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. It produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
