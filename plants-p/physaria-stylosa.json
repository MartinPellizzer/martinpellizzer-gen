    "intro": "Physaria stylosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Physaria stylosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
