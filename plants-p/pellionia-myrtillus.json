    "intro": "Pellionia myrtillus, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Pellionia myrtillus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
