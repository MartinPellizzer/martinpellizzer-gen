    "intro": "Polygala riparia, commonly known as the river milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences with tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Polygala riparia is often found in riparian zones and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
