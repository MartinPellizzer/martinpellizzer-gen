    "intro": "Philodendron subovatum, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, green berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers bright, indirect light. Its trailing growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a climbing plant in greenhouses."
