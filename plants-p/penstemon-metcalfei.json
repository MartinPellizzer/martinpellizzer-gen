    "intro": "Penstemon metcalfei, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Penstemon metcalfei is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
