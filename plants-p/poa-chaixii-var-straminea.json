    "intro": "Poa chaixii var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow meadow grass, is a variant of the Poa chaixii species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale yellow hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of temperate grassland ecosystems."
