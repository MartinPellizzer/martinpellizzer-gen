    "intro": "Peltaea surumuensis, commonly known as the Surumu peltate, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and related species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive peltate leaves, which have a broad, shield-like shape with the stem emerging from the center. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peltaea surumuensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
