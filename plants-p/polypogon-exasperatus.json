    "intro": "Polypogon exasperatus, commonly known as the rough panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Polypogon exasperatus is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in humid, swampy environments."
