It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, bladder-like structure that aids in seed dispersal.
