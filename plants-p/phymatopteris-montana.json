    "intro": "Phymatopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phymatopteris montana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
