    "intro": "Pelargonium phellodes, commonly known as the African geranium, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
