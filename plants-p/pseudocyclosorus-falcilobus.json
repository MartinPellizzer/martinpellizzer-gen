    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus falcilobus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often sword-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
