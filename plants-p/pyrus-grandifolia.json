    "intro": "Pyrus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved pear, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. Its fruit, similar to pears, is often used in culinary applications. Pyrus grandifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
