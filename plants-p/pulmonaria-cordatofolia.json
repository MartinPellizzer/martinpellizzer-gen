    "intro": "Pulmonaria cordatofolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white during spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage and flowers contribute to early-season nectar availability for pollinators."
