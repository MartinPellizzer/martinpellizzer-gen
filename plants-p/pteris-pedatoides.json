    "intro": "Pteris pedatoides, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, creeping growth habit. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a broad, flat structure that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, enabling the plant to colonize new areas effectively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ability to propagate and spread widely."
