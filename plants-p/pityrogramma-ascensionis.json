    "intro": "Pityrogramma ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
