It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by spherical, three-lobed berries. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
