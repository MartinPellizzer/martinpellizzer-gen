    "intro": "Pinus densiflora var. aurea, commonly known as the golden Chinese pine, is a variant of the Chinese pine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, flaky bark and golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are short and stout, typically measuring 2 to 4 centimeters in length. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking coloration and hardy nature."
