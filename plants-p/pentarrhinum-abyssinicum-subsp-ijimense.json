    "intro": "Pentarrhinum abyssinicum subsp. ijimense, commonly known as the Ethiopian starleaf, is a shrub native to the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
