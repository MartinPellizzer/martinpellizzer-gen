    "intro": "Polypodium fasciale, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bright green with a metallic sheen, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Polypodium fasciale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
