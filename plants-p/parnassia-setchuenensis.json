    "intro": "Parnassia setchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly faces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Parnassia setchuenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
