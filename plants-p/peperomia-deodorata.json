    "intro": "Peperomia deodorata, commonly known as the sweet pepper plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and oval-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding ornamental value. Peperomia deodorata thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to retain moisture in its thick leaves helps it survive in drier conditions."
