    "intro": "Poa alpina var. nana, commonly known as the alpine moss grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to alpine and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardiness and ecological significance, it is often found in mountainous areas and is a key component of alpine vegetation."
