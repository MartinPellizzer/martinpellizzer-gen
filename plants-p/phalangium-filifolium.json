    "intro": "Phalangium filifolium, commonly known as the thread-leaf fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems that produce small, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures consist of spore-producing cones, typical of ferns. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
