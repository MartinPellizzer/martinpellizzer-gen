    "intro": "Prenanthes nothae, commonly known as the hybrid water parsley, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
