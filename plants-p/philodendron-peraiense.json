    "intro": "Philodendron peraiense, commonly known as the red-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with striking red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its stems are long and can climb or trail, making it a popular choice for indoor hanging baskets or shelves. Philodendron peraiense is relatively low-maintenance, though it benefits from regular watering and well-draining soil."
