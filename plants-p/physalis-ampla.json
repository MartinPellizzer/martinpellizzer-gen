    "intro": "Physalis ampla, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or winter cherry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive papery calyx that encloses the fruit, which turns red when mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into the ornamental, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its decorative value. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is typically used in culinary applications in its native regions."
