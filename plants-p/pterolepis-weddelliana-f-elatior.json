    "intro": "Pterolepis weddelliana f. elatior, commonly known as the Weddell's pterolepis, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant features a slender, branched stem with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect excess sunlight in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
