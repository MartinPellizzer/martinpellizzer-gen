    "intro": "Pteridium centrali-africanum, commonly known as the African bracken, is a fern native to central Africa. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role in the region."
