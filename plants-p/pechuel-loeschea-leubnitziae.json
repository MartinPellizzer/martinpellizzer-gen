    "intro": "Pechuel-loeschea leubnitziae, commonly known as the Leubnitz's pechuel-loeschea, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a unique combination of hues, often including red, orange, and yellow. Native to the Andean highlands of South America, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
