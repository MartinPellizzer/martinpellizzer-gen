It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry plains. Its leaves are narrow and often have a grayish or blue-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.
