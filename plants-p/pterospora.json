    "intro": "Pterospora, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky, and often blue or purple flower heads that resemble small sea urchins. Pterospora species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
