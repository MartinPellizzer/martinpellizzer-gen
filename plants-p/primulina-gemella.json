    "intro": "Primulina gemella, commonly known as the twin-leaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are followed by berries.
