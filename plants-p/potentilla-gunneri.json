    "intro": "Potentilla gunneri, commonly known as Gunner's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and talus areas. The plant features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Potentilla gunneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
