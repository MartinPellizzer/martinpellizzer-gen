    "intro": "Polystichum cochleatum, commonly known as the curled fern or zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that unroll as they mature, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. Polystichum cochleatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
