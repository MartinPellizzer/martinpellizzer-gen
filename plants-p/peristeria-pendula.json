    "intro": "Peristeria pendula, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and southern Florida. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy white flowers that resemble lilies, which bloom in the evening and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Peristeria pendula is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
