It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and linear, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Polycarpon niveum is known for its ability to survive in cold climates due to its winter-hardy nature."
