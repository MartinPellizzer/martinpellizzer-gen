    "intro": "Pyrrocoma hirta var. lanulosa, commonly known as the woolly pygmy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
