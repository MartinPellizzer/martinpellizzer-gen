    "intro": "Pimpinella diversifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread via horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
