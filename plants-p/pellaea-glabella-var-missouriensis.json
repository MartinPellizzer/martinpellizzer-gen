    "intro": "Pellaea glabella var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri barrenfoxtail, is a perennial fern native to the central United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sorus, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The varietal form, missouriensis, is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
