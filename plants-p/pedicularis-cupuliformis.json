    "intro": "Pedicularis cupuliformis, commonly known as the hooded lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, often with a distinctive hood-like structure over the throat. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
