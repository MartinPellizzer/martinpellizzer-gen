    "intro": "Polystichum tenerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a soft, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
