It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are finely serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
