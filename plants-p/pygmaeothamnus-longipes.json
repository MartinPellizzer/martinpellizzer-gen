It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, often glandular leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
