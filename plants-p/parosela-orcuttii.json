    "intro": "Parosela orcuttii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
