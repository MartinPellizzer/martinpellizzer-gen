    "intro": "Phelipanche mutelii, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
