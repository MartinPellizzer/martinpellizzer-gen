    "intro": "Pitcairnia beachiae, commonly known as the beach pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with clusters of colorful, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which provide protection against strong coastal winds and salt spray. Pitcairnia beachiae is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens."
