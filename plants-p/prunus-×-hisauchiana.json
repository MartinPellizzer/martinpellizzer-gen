    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 hisauchiana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Higan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrula and Prunus lusitanica. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, dark red berries in the fall. This species is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value and cultural significance in gardens and landscapes."
