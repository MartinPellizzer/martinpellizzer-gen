    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, dense, dark green leaves and its tall, slender flowering spike that bears numerous small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in damp soil. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. The species is also noted for its fragrant, sweet-smelling flowers that attract various pollinators."
