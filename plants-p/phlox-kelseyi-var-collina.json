    "intro": "Phlox kelseyi var. collina, commonly known as the mountain phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
