It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant features slender, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is distinguished by its variability in leaf color and subtle differences in morphology compared to other Poa species."
