    "intro": "Psilogramme hispidula, commonly known as the hairy psilogramme, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Psilogramme hispidula is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks."
