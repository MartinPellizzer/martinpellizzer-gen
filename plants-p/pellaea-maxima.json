    "intro": "Pellaea maxima, commonly known as the giant lady's mantle, is a perennial fern native to South America. It features a rosette of waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
