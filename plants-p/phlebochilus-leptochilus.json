    "intro": "Phlebochilus leptochilus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
