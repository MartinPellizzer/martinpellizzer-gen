    "intro": "Platanthera lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and specific light conditions to thrive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Platanthera lucida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
