    "intro": "Pneumonanthe bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-lobed lungwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its unique, bi-lobed leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
