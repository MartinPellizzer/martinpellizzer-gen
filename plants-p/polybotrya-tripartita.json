    "intro": "Polybotrya tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polybotrya tripartita is considered a species of conservation concern."
