    "intro": "Pleioblastus tectus var. protensus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a cold-hardy evergreen bamboo species native to East Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that are often covered in a distinctive grayish-white sheath, giving it a unique, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that add visual interest. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. Its slow growth and compact size make it an ideal choice for small spaces and container gardening."
