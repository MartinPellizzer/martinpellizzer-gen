    "intro": "Pollalesta brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian star vine, is a climbing plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. These flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in humid, shaded environments. Pollalesta brasiliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
