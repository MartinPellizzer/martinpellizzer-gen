The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits known as cherries. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is often cultivated in gardens and orchards."
