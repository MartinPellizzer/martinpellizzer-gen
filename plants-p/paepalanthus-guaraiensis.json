    "intro": "Paepalanthus guaraiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
