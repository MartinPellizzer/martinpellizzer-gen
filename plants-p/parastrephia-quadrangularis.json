    "intro": "Parastrephia quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems, which are often ribbed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
