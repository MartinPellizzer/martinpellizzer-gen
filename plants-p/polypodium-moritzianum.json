    "intro": "Polypodium moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and pinnately compound fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium moritzianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
