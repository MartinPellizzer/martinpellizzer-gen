It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, typical of many species in its family. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
