    "intro": "Pinus brutia var. agrophiotii, commonly known as the Cyprus pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this species are relatively small and often hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
