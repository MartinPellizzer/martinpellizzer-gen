    "intro": "Poa piperi, commonly known as the Piper's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically borne in dense clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Poa piperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
