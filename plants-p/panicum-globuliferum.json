It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence that resembles a small sphere. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are encased in a hard, protective covering. Panicum globuliferum is often cultivated as a forage crop and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
