    "intro": "Piper hirsutum var. olfersianum, commonly known as the hairy pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by reddish berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and greenhouses."
