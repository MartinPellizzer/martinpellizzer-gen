    "intro": "Prunus pendula f. diffusa, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a flowering shrub or small tree characterized by its cascading branches that bear clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers in spring. It is a natural variant of Prunus pendula, distinguished by its more diffuse and spreading growth habit compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as drupes, which ripen to a dark red or black color in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The leaves are simple, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal."
