It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and relatively short, stiff needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones are woody and elongated, with scales that open to release the seeds. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important tree in its native habitat."
