It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
