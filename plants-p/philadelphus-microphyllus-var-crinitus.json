    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus var. crinitus, commonly known as the curly-leaved mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge. The leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name."
