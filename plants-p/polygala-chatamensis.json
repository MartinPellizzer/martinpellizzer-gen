    "intro": "Polygala chatamensis, commonly known as Chatam's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid conditions of the island's interior. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
