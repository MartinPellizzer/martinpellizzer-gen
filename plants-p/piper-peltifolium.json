    "intro": "Piper peltifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf pepper or peltate pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, slender berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in warm climates."
