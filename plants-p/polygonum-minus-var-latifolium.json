    "intro": "Polygonum minus var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a resilient wildflower and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
