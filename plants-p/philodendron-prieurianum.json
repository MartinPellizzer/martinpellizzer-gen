It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
