    "intro": "Pterostylis scitula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem and produces a single, pale green or white flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. It has a short flowering period, typically in spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
