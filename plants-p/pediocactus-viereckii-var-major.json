    "intro": "Pediocactus viereckii var. major, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its large, spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
