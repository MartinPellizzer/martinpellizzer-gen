    "intro": "Poa secunda subsp. secunda, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, bearing small, two-lobed glumes and three to five flowering lemmas. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
