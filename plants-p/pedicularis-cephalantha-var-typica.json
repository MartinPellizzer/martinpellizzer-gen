It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant is an hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, displaying a range of pink to reddish hues. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
