    "intro": "Pycnandra blanchonii, commonly known as the Madagascar star vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
