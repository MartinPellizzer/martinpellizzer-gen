    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. onoei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to East Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
