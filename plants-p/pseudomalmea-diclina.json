    "intro": "Pseudomalmea diclina, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Pseudomalmea diclina is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
