    "intro": "Parietaria appendiculata var. vulcanii, commonly known as the volcanic wall pennywort, is a variant of the wall pennywort species native to certain regions of Italy. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or calcareous soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is notable for its adaptability to volcanic soils, making it a unique example of plant resilience in extreme conditions."
