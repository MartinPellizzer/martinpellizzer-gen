It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, though it is not related to the black pepper plant. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It produces small, three-lobed berries that are typically green when mature. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streams."
