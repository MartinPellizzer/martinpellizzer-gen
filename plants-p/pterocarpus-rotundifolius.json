    "intro": "Pterocarpus rotundifolius, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
