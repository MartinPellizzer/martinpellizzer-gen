    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. triangulariovata, commonly known as the triangular-leaved cowparsley, is a rare variant of the cowparsley species. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves, which are broader and more robust than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
