    "intro": "Podogynium capparidaceum, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Podogynium species are carnivorous, relying on the captured prey for nutrients. Their morphology includes small, floating leaves with specialized bladders that facilitate their predatory lifestyle."
