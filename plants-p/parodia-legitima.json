    "intro": "Parodia legitima, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its unique, ornamental appearance."
