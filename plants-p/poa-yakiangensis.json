    "intro": "Poa yakiangensis, commonly known as the Yakiang sedge, is a perennial grass species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetland or marshy habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage. Poa yakiangensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
