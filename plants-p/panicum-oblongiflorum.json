It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, elongated flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum oblongiflorum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various insects and birds."
