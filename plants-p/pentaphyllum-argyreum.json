It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces smooth, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
