    "intro": "Philodendron monsalveae, commonly known as the Montr\u00e9al Philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and a deep green coloration. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside of specialized botanical collections."
