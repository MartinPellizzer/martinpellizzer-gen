    "intro": "Paspalum circulare, commonly known as the circular paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Paspalum circulare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
