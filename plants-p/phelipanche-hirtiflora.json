    "intro": "Phelipanche hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that open in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
