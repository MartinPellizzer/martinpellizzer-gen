    "intro": "Pyrus yuana, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its clusters of white flowers in spring. The tree produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other pear varieties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Pyrus yuana is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for."
