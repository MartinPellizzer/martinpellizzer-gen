    "intro": "Polygala bicarunculata, commonly known as the two-lobed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
