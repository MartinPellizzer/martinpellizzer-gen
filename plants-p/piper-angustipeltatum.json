    "intro": "Piper angustipeltatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Piper angustipeltatum is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its preference for humid, warm environments."
