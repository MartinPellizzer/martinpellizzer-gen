    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 huancayanum, commonly known as the Huancayana shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
