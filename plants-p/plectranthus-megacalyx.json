    "intro": "Plectranthus megacalyx, commonly known as the purple heart plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Plectranthus megacalyx is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit."
