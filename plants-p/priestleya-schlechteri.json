    "intro": "Priestleya schlechteri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
