    "intro": "Phaius candidissimus, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty."
