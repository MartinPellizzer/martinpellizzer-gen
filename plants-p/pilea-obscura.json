    "intro": "Pilea obscura, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, velvety leaves that are slightly hairy to the touch, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea obscura is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and occasional pruning to maintain its compact shape."
