It is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale blue flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments, often found in desert or semi-desert regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
