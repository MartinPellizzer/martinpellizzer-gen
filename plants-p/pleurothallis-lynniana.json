    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis lynniana, commonly known as the Lynn's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to support its growth. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
