    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. stipulacea, commonly known as the swamp cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves with stipules, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
