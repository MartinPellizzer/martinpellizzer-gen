    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia subsp. nigra, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the autumn. These berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, and the plant is often used in hedgerows for its dense growth habit. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
