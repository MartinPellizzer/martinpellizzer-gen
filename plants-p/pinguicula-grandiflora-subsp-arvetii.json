    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. arvetii, commonly known as the broad-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, erect stems with showy, white or pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are glandular and adapted for nutrient absorption, making it an effective predator in nutrient-poor soils."
