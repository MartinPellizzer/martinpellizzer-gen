    "intro": "Pterospartum tridentatum var. stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterospartum, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against drought and herbivory. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments."
