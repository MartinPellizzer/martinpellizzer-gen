    "intro": "Pinguicula oxyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Pinguicula oxyptera is a low-growing plant that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to the lack of fertile soil in its habitat."
