    "intro": "Pleurothallis galeata, commonly known as the silver orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess light in its shaded habitat. Pleurothallis galeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
