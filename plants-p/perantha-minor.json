    "intro": "Perantha minor, commonly known as the lesser perantha, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white flowers bloom in early spring. Perantha minor is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
