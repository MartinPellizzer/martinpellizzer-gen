    "intro": "Phyllanthus rapaensis, commonly known as the Rapa Island goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rapa, part of the French territory of French Polynesia. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to rhombic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, smooth, green fruits. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
