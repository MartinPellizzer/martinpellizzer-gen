    "intro": "Phaseolus pardus var. carneus, commonly known as the pink runner bean, is a variant of the runner bean species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to reddish flowers and elongated, bean-like pods that mature to a pale yellow or greenish hue. The plant is a vigorous climbing vine, often reaching several meters in height, with compound leaves and tendrils for support. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for both its ornamental value and edible pods, which are harvested before they fully mature."
