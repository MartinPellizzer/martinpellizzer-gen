It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. Prunus rotunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
