    "intro": "Pseudosclerochloa, commonly known as the hard-leaved grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tough, fibrous leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats, making them well-adapted to harsh conditions. Pseudosclerochloa species are often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as parts of California and Chile. Their reproductive structures include spikelets with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grasses."
