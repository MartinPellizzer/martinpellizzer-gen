    "intro": "Poa palustris var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass found in wetland and moist soil environments. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
