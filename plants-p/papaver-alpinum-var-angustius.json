    "intro": "Papaver alpinum var. angustius, commonly known as the narrowleaf poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils at high altitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
