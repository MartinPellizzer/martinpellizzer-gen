    "intro": "Polygonum fruticulosum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Polygonum fruticulosum is noted for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread readily in suitable environments."
