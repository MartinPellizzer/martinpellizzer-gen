    "intro": "Pilocereus columna, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
