    "intro": "Pappostipa jucunda, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often surrounded by bracts. Pappostipa jucunda is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local wildlife."
