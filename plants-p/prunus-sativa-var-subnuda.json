    "intro": "Prunus sativa var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless bark and slender, arching branches. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are typically smaller than those of other cherry varieties. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its fruit, which is used in traditional cuisine and beverages."
