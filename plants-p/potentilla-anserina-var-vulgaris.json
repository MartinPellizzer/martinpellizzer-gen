    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. vulgaris, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-white leaves that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
