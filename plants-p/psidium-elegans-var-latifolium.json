    "intro": "Psidium elegans var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits similar to common guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The broadleaf guava is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
