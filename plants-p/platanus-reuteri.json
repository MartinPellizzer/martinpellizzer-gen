It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and flaky, often peeling in a distinctive manner. Platanus reuteri is well adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in its native habitat."
