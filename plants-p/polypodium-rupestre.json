    "intro": "Polypodium rupestre, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and fronds that typically grow on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium rupestre thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or on cliffs. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
