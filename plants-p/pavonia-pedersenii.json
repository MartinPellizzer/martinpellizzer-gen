    "intro": "Pavonia pedersenii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pavonia pedersenii is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
