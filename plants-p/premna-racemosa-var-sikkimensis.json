    "intro": "Premna racemosa var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim premna, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
