It is native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas, where it thrives in coastal and limestone habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink or red bracts that surround its small, clustered flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pisonia riedeliana is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils."
