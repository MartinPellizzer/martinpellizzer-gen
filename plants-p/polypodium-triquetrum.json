    "intro": "Polypodium triquetrum, commonly known as the three-lobed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium triquetrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
