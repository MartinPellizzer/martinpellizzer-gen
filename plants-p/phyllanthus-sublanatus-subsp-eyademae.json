    "intro": "Phyllanthus sublanatus subsp. eyademae, commonly known as the Eyademae phyllanthus, is a shrub native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
