It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassland and open woodland habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
