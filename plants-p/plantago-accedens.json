    "intro": "Plantago accedens, commonly known as sand plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in elongated spikes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
