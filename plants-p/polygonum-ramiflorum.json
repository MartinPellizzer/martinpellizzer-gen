    "intro": "Polygonum ramiflorum, commonly known as the branching flower knotweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its stout, erect stems that often branch profusely, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Polygonum ramiflorum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
