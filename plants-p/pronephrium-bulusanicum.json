    "intro": "Pronephrium bulusanicum, commonly known as the Bulusan kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Pronephrium bulusanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
