    "intro": "Pedicularis numeniicephala, commonly known as the skyward larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
