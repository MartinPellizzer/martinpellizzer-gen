    "intro": "Puhuaea megaphylla var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous giant fern, is a variant of the giant fern species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs, giving it a smooth texture. This variant is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in Hawaiian rainforests."
