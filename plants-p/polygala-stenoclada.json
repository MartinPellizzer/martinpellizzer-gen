    "intro": "Polygala stenoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and they bloom during the warmer months of the year."
