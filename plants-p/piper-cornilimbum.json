    "intro": "Piper cornilimbum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, posing challenges to native ecosystems."
