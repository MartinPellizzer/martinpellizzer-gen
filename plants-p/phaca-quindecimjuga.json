    "intro": "Phaca quindecimjuga, commonly known as the fifteen-lobed phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers with fifteen distinct lobes on each petal. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Phaca quindecimjuga is considered an endangered species."
