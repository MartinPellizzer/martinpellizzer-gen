It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It often grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Psychotria lucentifolia is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
