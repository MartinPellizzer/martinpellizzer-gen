    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyi var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Jeffrey pine, is a variant of the Jeffrey pine native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a tall, slender evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often retained on the branches for many years, a feature known as serotiny. It thrives in coastal habitats with mild, wet winters and dry summers. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
