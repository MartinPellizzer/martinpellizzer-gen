    "intro": "Phoradendron longispicum, commonly known as the long-spined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It possesses small, fleshy leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's berries are typically red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is dependent on both sunlight and the nutrients it steals from its host. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruit."
