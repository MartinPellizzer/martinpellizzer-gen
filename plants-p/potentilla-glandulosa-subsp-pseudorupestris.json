    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa subsp. pseudorupestris, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It typically features multiple stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry, sunny conditions."
