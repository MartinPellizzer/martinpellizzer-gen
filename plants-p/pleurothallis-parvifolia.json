    "intro": "Pleurothallis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Pleurothallis parvifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
