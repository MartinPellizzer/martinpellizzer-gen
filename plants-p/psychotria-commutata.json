    "intro": "Psychotria commutata, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"coco de mono,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often hairy. Psychotria commutata is often cultivated for its ornamental value but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
