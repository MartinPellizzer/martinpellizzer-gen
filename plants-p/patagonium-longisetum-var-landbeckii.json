    "intro": "Patagonium longisetum var. landbeckii, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
