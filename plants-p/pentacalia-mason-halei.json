It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
