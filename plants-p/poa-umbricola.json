    "intro": "Poa umbricola, commonly known as the shade grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in shaded areas. Poa umbricola is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in low-light habitats."
