    "intro": "Pilosella officinarum subsp. melanops, commonly known as the black-leaved whitlow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that turn blackish with age. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and distinctive flowering pattern make it easily identifiable within the genus Pilosella."
