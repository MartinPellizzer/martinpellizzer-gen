    "intro": "Pinus strobus var. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan White Pine, is a rare variant of the eastern white pine native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more rigid than those of the typical white pine. The cones of this variety are generally smaller and more compact, with a distinctive shape that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
