    "intro": "Pseudo-acacia hispida, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemate clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid and semi-arid environments. Pseudo-acacia hispida is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
