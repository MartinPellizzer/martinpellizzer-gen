    "intro": "Penstemon palmeri subsp. typicus, commonly known as Palmer's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
