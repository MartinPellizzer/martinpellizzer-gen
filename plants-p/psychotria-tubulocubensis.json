    "intro": "Psychotria tubulocubensis, commonly known as the Cuban psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white or pale pink petals, and its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
