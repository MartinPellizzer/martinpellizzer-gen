    "intro": "Psorothamnus kingii, commonly known as King's shadscale, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pale green pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid regions. Psorothamnus kingii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
