    "intro": "Pinguicula macroceras subsp. nortensis, commonly known as the Norten's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
