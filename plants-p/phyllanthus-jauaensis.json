The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
