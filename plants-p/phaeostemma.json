    "intro": "Phaeostemma, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its silver-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Phaeostemma species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
