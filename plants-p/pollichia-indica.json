    "intro": "Pollichia indica, commonly known as the Indian broom or false broom, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Pollichia indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
