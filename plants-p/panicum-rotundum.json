    "intro": "Panicum rotundum, commonly known as roundleaf panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its round, compressed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Panicum rotundum is adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage production."
