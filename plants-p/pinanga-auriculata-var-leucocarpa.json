    "intro": "Pinanga auriculata var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited bamboo palm, is a variant of the bamboo palm species native to Southeast Asia. It is a compact, evergreen plant with a rosette of arching, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
