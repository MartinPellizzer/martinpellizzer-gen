    "intro": "Phymatopteris obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor."
