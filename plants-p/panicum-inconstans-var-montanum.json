    "intro": "Panicum inconstans var. montanum, commonly known as mountain red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, red-tipped inflorescences that are often mistaken for other panicum species. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
