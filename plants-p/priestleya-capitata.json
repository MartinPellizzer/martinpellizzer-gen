    "intro": "Priestleya capitata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Priestleya capitata is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can go dormant during periods of extreme drought."
