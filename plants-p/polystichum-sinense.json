    "intro": "Polystichum sinense, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant features a short, thick rhizome that supports its upright growth habit. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum sinense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shaded, moist environments."
