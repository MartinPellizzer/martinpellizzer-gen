    "intro": "Pithecoctenium scabriusculum var. macranthum, commonly known as the broad-fruited pithecocarp, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its robust, tree-like growth habit. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves and produces clustered, orange-yellow flowers that are typical of its genus. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain a single seed, and they are often dispersed by birds. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical form of the species."
