    "intro": "Parodia stuemeri var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Stuemer's pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense arrangement of white to pale green spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant typically produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
