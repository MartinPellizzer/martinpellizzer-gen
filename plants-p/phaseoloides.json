These plants are characterized by their climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. They thrive in warm climates and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Phaseoloides species are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Their flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive papilionaceous structure."
