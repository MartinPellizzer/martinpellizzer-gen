    "intro": "Phacelia ramosissima var. hispida, commonly known as hispid phacelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features a bushy growth habit with numerous branched stems that are often covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear a similar hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
