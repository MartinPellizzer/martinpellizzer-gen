    "intro": "Polypodium sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
