    "intro": "Plantago trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is well adapted to dry conditions. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
