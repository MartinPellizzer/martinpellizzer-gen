    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. major, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
