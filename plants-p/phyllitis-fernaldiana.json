    "intro": "Phyllitis fernaldiana, commonly known as the Fernald's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into three parts, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Phyllitis fernaldiana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
