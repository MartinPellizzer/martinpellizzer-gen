    "intro": "Polypodium salicinum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium salicinum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
