    "intro": "Panicum sylvaticum, commonly known as woodland panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
