    "intro": "Panicum corvi, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a species of grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, often in disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum corvi is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
