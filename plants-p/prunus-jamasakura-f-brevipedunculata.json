It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter peduncles compared to the typical Prunus jamasakura. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and a dark green color. This cultivar is often appreciated for its delicate beauty and is cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
