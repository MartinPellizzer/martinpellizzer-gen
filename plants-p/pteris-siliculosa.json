    "intro": "Pteris siliculosa, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris siliculosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
