    "intro": "Parodia camargensis, commonly known as the Camargue prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern France and parts of Spain. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Parodia camargensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
