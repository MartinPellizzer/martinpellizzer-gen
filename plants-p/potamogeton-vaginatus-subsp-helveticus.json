    "intro": "Potamogeton vaginatus subsp. helveticus, commonly known as the European pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe. It has long, slender leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, usually emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by stabilizing sediments. It is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
