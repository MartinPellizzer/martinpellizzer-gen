    "intro": "Perakanthus pauciflorus, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Perakanthus pauciflorus is considered a rare and endangered species."
