    "intro": "Poa firma, commonly known as the firm grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, Poa firma is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
