    "intro": "Pouteria speciosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree is notable for its long, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
