It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green with a reddish or rusty underside, giving it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
