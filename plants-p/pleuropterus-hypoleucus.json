    "intro": "Pleuropterus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are white with a yellow center and bloom in late summer. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
