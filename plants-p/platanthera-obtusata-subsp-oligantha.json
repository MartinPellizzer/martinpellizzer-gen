    "intro": "Platanthera obtusata subsp. oligantha, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
