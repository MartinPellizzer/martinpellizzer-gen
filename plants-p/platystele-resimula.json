    "intro": "Platystele resimula, commonly known as the Resimul\u00e1 Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features small, delicate leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white and yellow hues. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Platystele resimula is considered an endangered species."
