    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. decumbens, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a variant of the Himalayan blue pine. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan and northern India. The tree has a distinctive appearance with a sprawling, often prostrate growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and alpine environments. Its needles are long, blue-gray in color, and its cones are typically pendulous. This variety is valued for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its ecological importance in mountainous ecosystems."
