    "intro": "Plantago coronopus subsp. macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted plantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet environments. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
