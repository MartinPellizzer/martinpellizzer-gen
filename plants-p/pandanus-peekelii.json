It is characterized by its long, stiff leaves that form a dense rosette around the plant's base. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. Pandanus peekelii is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatching material."
