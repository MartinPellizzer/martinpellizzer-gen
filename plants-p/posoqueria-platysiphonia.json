    "intro": "Posoqueria platysiphonia, commonly known as the broad-siphon sea fan, is a species of gorgonian coral found in the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean. It has a distinctive branching structure with elongated, fan-like polyps that are typically pale yellow or brown in color. The plant thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reefs and seagrass beds. Its skeletal structure is composed of a calcareous exoskeleton, which provides support for its soft, fleshy tissues. This coral plays an important role in marine ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
