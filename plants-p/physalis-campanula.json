    "intro": "Physalis campanula, commonly known as the common groundcherry, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits covered in a papery husk. These fruits, which ripen to a bright orange or red color, contain several small, edible seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and is also used in some culinary applications."
