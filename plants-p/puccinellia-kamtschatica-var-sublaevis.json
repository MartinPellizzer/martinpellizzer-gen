    "intro": "Puccinellia kamtschatica var. sublaevis, commonly known as the smooth puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces, distinguishing it from other varieties of Puccinellia."
