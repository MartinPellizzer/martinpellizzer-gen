    "intro": "Pimelea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved riceflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Pimelea crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
