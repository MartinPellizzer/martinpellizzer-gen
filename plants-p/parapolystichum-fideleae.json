    "intro": "Parapolystichum fideleae, commonly known as the faithful fern, is a rare and unique species of fern belonging to the family Polystichaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year, providing a consistent green presence in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, a common reproductive feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Parapolystichum fideleae is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
