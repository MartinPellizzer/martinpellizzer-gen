    "intro": "Polycarpon coquimbense, commonly known as the Coquimbo morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Polycarpon coquimbense is often found in coastal dunes and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
