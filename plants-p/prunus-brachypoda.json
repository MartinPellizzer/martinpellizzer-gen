    "intro": "Prunus brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often considered less palatable compared to other cherry species. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus brachypoda is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
