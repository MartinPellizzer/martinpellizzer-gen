    "intro": "Phacelia laxiflora, commonly known as the slender phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia laxiflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
