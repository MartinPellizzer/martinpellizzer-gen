    "intro": "Phragmipedium hirtzii var. hirtzii, commonly known as the Hirtz's phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for intermediate care in home environments."
