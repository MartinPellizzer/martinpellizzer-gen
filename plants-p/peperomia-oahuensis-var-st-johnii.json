    "intro": "Peperomia oahuensis var. st-johnii, commonly known as Oahu Peperomia, is a rare and unique species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a compact, evergreen shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
