    "intro": "Pinosia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pine, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is often covered in glandular dots, which secrete a sticky substance. Pinosia glandulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and chaparral habitats."
