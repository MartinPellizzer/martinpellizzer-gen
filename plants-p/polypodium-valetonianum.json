    "intro": "Polypodium valetonianum, commonly known as the Valeton's wall-rue, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizome from which both fronds and roots emerge, with the fronds being pinnate and often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover called a indusium. This fern is relatively uncommon and is found primarily in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
