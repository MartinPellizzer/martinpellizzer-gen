It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces elliptical pods that contain edible seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
