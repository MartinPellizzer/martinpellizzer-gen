    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the meadow poppy characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in dry meadows and rocky soils. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role. The white poppy is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
