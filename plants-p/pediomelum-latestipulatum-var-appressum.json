    "intro": "Pediomelum latestipulatum var. appressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pediomelum, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
