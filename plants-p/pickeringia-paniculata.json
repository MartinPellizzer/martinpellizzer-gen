    "intro": "Pickeringia paniculata, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal cluster. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in spike-like inflorescences that rise above the foliage. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and traditional medicinal uses. Pickeringia paniculata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
