    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant yellow blooms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing alpine soils."
