    "intro": "Papaver radicatum f. glabriusculum, commonly known as the glabrous poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region, typically growing in rocky or dry soils. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
