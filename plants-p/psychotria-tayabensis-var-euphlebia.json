    "intro": "Psychotria tayabensis var. euphlebia, commonly known as the Yucat\u00e1n psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
