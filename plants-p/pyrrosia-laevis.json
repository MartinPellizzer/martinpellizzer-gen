    "intro": "Pyrrosia laevis, commonly known as the smooth rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in small, round groups. Pyrrosia laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
