    "intro": "Paraboea tribracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf vine, is a climbing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
