    "intro": "Pernettya polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its berries are dark blue or black and are edible, though they are often used in local cuisines. Pernettya polyphylla is adapted to harsh, cold climates and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
