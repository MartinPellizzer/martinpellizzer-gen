    "intro": "Pleiospora latebracteolata, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its floral structures. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various regions of Europe and Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a subject of ecological interest."
