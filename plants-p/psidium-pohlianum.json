    "intro": "Psidium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits similar to guavas but smaller in size. Psidium pohlianum thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Psidium genus."
