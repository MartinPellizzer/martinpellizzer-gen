It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. The fruit produced is a small, sweet drupe, though it is not typically harvested for consumption."
