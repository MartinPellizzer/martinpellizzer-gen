    "intro": "Phyllanthus epiphylliferens, commonly known as the leafy phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
