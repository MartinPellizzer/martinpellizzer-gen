It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its fruits are similar in appearance to pears but have a distinct, crisp texture and a slightly tart flavor. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and culinary uses in traditional Chinese cuisine."
