    "intro": "Pedilanthus millspaughii, commonly known as the millspaugh's candleplant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is extensive, helping it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
