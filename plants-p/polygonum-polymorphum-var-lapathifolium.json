    "intro": "Polygonum polymorphum var. lapathifolium, commonly known as the variable knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple tinge. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late summer. This species is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
