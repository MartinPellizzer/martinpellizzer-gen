    "intro": "Papaver macrostomum var. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's poppy, is a variant of the broad-mouthed poppy native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive broad, fleshy mouth-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
