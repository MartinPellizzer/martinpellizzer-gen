    "intro": "Poa aurea, commonly known as golden poa, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking yellowish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as along stream banks and in forest margins. Its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate inflorescence make it a distinctive ornamental plant. Poa aurea is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
