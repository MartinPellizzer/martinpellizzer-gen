    "intro": "Polystichum gonggashanense, commonly known as Gonggashan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit. This fern is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
