    "intro": "Piofontia cinerascens subsp. puracensis, commonly known as the Purac\u00e9n Whiteleaf, is a rare shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
