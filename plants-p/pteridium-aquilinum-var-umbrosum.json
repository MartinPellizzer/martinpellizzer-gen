    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. umbrosum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a variant of the common bracken species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that produces fronds with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, serrated texture. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which can dominate the undergrowth in certain ecosystems."
