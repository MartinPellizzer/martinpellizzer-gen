    "intro": "Pyrus karpatii, commonly known as the Carpathian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its sharp, spiny branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
