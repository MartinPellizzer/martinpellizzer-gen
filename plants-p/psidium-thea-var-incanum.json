    "intro": "Psidium thea var. incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf guava, is a variant of the guava species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-white pubescent leaves, which give it its common name, and its small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically less flavorful compared to other guava varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
