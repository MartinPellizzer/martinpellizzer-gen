    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as narrowleaf horsegram, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces compact spikelets with pale green to reddish flowers, which are often clustered near the base of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control and as a forage crop. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance contribute to its adaptability in various environmental conditions."
