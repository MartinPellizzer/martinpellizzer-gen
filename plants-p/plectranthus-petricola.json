    "intro": "Plectranthus petricola, commonly known as the rock plectranthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
