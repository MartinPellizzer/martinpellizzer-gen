    "intro": "Populus monilifera var. erecta, commonly known as the erect poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, often pendulous, leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
