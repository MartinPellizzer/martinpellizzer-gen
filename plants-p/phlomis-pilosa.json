    "intro": "Phlomis pilosa, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Phlomis pilosa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
