    "intro": "Pergularia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pergularia rostrata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
