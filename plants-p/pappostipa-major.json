    "intro": "Pappostipa major, commonly known as the tall grass muhly, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Pappostipa major is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
