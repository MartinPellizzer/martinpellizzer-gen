    "intro": "Phacelia prostrata, commonly known as creeping phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fluffy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Creeping phacelia is often used in wildflower mixes due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil."
