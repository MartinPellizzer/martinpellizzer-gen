    "intro": "Peperomia parva, commonly known as the dwarf pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Peperomia parva is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
