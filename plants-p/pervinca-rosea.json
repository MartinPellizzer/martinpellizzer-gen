    "intro": "Pervinca rosea, commonly known as the common yellow arum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking yellow spathe, which encloses the small, greenish-white spadix. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Pervinca rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
