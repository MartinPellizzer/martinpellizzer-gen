    "intro": "Piper cordoncillo, commonly known as the golden vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Piper cordoncillo is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover trellises or walls."
