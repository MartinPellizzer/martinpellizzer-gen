    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its environment."
