    "intro": "Pyrola longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pyrola, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Pyrola longifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a valuable component of montane and northern hardwood forest ecosystems."
