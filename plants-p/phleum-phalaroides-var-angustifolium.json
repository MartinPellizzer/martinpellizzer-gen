It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
