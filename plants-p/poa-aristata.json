    "intro": "Poa aristata, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Poa aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, resilient nature."
