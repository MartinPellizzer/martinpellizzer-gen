    "intro": "Plesiatropha klaineana, commonly known as the Klamath bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and along streambanks. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive blue or purple hue. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Plesiatropha klaineana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
