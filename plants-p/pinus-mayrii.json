    "intro": "Pinus mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and a conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces yellowish-orange cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
