    "intro": "Philodendron alatiundulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that have a distinctive undulating margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
