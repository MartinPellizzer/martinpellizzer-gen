    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. owyheensis, commonly known as the Owyhees potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
