    "intro": "Poa pricei, commonly known as the Price's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa pricei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates in its native range."
