    "intro": "Panicum pseudoinfestum, commonly known as the false panic grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and full sun, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for erosion control and ornamental use."
