    "intro": "Primula patens, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval and arranged in a rosette, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Primula patens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
