    "intro": "Plectranthus geminatus, commonly known as the silver bush or narrow-leaf plectranthus, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Plectranthus geminatus is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
