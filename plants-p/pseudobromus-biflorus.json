    "intro": "Pseudobromus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two flowers per spike. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability. Pseudobromus biflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
