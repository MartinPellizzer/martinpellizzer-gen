    "intro": "Piper guadaloupense, commonly known as the Guadaloupe pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Guadalupe, and is characterized by its climbing habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, peppery fruits. It is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and fruits, which are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
