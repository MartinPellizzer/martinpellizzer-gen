    "intro": "Psidium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, with a thin, smooth skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
