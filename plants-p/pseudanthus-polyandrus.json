    "intro": "Pseudanthus polyandrus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, adapting to arid environments. Pseudanthus polyandrus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
