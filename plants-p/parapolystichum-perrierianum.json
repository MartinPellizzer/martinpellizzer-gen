    "intro": "Parapolystichum perrierianum, commonly known as the Perrier's cliff brake, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded rock crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
