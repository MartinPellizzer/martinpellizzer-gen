It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry climates."
