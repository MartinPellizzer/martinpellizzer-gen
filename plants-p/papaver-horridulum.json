    "intro": "Papaver horridulum, commonly known as the rough poppy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive black spot at the base of the corolla. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The rough poppy is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
