    "intro": "Psammophiliella stepposa, commonly known as the steppe sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and loamy soils, often found in steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss in arid conditions. Psammophiliella stepposa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
