It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle made up of small spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Panicum campylogrammum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
