It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
