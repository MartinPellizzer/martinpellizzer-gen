    "intro": "Pennisetum chevalieri, commonly known as blue fescue, is a low-growing, ornamental grass native to the western United States. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant typically reaches heights of 6 to 12 inches and spreads via rhizomes, forming dense clumps. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Pennisetum chevalieri is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
