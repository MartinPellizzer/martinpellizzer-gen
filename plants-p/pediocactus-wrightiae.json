    "intro": "Pediocactus wrightiae, commonly known as Wright's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. Pediocactus wrightiae is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
