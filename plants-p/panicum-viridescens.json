It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
