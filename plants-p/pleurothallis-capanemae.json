    "intro": "Pleurothallis capanemae, commonly known as the Capanema orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in spikes and bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
