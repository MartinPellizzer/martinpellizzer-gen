    "intro": "Pourretia pungens, commonly known as the spiny poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, which are actually the true flowers of the plant. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in sharp spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, especially during the holiday season due to its association with Christmas."
