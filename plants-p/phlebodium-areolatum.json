    "intro": "Phlebodium areolatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's fronds are distinctive, with a velvety, golden-green appearance and a unique, shield-like shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
