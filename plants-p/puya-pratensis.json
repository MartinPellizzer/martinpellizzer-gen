    "intro": "Puya pratensis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Puya pratensis is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and visually stunning species."
