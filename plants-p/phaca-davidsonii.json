    "intro": "Phaca davidsonii, commonly known as Davidson's phaca, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
