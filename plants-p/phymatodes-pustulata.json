    "intro": "Phymatodes pustulata, commonly known as the Texas starburst, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often found in prairies and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
