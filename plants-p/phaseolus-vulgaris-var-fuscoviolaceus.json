    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. fuscoviolaceus, commonly known as the dark violet pole bean, is a variant of the common bean species characterized by its deep violet to almost black pod coloration. This variety is native to the Americas and is typically grown for its ornamental value rather than for culinary use due to its intense color and unique appearance. The plant produces erect growth with trifoliate leaves and bears small, bean-like pods that mature to a striking dark hue. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its distinctive color makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visual interest in their landscapes."
