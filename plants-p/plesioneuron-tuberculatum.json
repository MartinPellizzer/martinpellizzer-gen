    "intro": "Plesioneuron tuberculatum, commonly known as the warty pterostigma, is a rare and specialized fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty spore cases that are unique among ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are delicate and often have a feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
