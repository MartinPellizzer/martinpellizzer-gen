    "intro": "Procris ponapensis, commonly known as the Pohnpei cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like structure that produces seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
