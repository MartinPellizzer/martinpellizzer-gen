    "intro": "Panicum stenocladium, commonly known as narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in erosion control."
