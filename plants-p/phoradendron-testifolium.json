    "intro": "Phoradendron testifolium, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, green leaves that are opposite and often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
