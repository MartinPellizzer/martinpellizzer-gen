    "intro": "Potameia kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi potameia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi, China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
