    "intro": "Ponera adendrobium, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the rainy season. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
