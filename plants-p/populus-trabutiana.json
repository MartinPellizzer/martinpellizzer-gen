    "intro": "Populus trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure. It is often found in riparian zones and forest edges, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
