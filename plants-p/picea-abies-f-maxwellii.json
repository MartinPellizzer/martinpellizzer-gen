It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slower growth rate compared to the typical Norway spruce. The foliage is generally denser, with shorter, more upright shoots. It exhibits distinct morphological features, including a more conical shape and reduced branching. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal."
