It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
