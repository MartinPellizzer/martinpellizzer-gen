    "intro": "Polygonum umbellatum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive umbel-like appearance. Polygonum umbellatum is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
