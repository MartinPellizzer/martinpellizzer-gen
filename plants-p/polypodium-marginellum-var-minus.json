    "intro": "Polypodium marginellum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser marginal huperzia, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shady garden settings."
