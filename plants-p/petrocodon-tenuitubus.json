    "intro": "Petrocodon tenuitubus, commonly known as the narrow-tubed petrocodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Petrocodon tenuitubus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, high-altitude habitats."
