    "intro": "Piper albert-smithii, commonly known as Albert-Smith's pepper, is a rare and endangered species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes numerous species of flowering plants in the family Piperaceae. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
