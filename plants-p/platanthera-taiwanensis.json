    "intro": "Platanthera taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like leaves and its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It is noted for its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
