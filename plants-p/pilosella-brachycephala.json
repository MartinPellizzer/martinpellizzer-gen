    "intro": "Pilosella brachycephala, commonly known as the short-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella brachycephala is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
