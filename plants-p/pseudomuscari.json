    "intro": "Pseudomuscari, commonly known as the false muscari, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. These plants are native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, where they thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. They are characterized by their grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Pseudomuscari species are typically perennial and bloom in late spring or early summer. Their botanical features make them popular choices for rock gardens and as ornamental plants in horticulture."
