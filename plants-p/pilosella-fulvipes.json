    "intro": "Pilosella fulvipes, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant's leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
