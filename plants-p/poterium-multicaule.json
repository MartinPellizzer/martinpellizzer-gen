    "intro": "Poterium multicaule, commonly known as the many-stemmed marshplant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, branching stems that rise from a central base, supporting small, clustered white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Poterium multicaule plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
