    "intro": "Paepalanthus mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
