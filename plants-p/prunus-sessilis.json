    "intro": "Prunus sessilis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamazakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, round fruits called cherries, which are typically sour and not suitable for eating. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in Japanese gardens."
