    "intro": "Pontederia cordata f. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped to arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy surface. The plant produces showy blue to purple spike-like flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in wetland environments and is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
