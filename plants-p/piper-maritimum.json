    "intro": "Piper maritimum, commonly known as the sea pepper or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in saline and coastal environments, often growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils. The plant's resilience to salt and wind makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
