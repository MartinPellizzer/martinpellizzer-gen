    "intro": "Polypodium locellatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Polypodium locellatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
