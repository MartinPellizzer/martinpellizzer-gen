It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slight pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
