    "intro": "Pontederia belophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hyacinth, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features dark green, broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize water bodies make it both a decorative plant and an invasive species in non-native regions."
