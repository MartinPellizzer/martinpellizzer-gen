    "intro": "Poa ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
