It features wiry, arching stems covered in soft, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
