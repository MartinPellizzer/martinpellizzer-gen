    "intro": "Polyalthia, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia, India, and parts of Africa, and are characterized by their striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while the bark is smooth and often fissured. Polyalthia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. They are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
