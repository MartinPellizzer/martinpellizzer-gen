    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris cruciata, commonly known as the cross-fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped fronds that are divided into narrow, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pseudophegopteris cruciata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
