    "intro": "Polypodium torulosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Polypodium torulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
