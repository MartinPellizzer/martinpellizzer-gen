    "intro": "Phlox coldryana, commonly known as the cold river phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pink to lavender-colored blooms in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Phlox coldryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
