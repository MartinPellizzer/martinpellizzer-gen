    "intro": "Plegmatolemma, commonly known as the outermost layer of the plant cell wall, is a specialized structure found in certain plant cells. It is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, which contribute to its structural integrity and flexibility. This layer plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from mechanical stress and environmental damage. Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of water movement and the transport of small molecules across the cell membrane. The plegmatolemma is particularly prominent in parenchyma and epidermal cells of various plant tissues."
