It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and relatively smaller size compared to the typical silver fir. The foliage is dense and dark green, with a silvery-blue hue on the underside of the needles. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. This form is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
