    "intro": "Pterophyton, commonly known as the feather moss, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the division Marchantiophyta. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Pterophyton lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying on diffusion for nutrient and water uptake. Its simple morphology and ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention make it an important component of many ecosystems."
