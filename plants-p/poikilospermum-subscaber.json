    "intro": "Poikilospermum subscaber, commonly known as the rough-skinned poikilospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a rough, textured surface, which contributes to its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fruits that are typically clustered and contain hard, seed-like structures. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
