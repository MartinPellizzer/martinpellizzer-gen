    "intro": "Pastinaca anethum, commonly known as wild celery or apiaceous weed, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a strong, pungent odor similar to celery and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The roots of Pastinaca anethum are not typically harvested for culinary use but are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
