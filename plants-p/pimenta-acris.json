    "intro": "Pimenta acris, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed."
