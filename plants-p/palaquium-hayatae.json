    "intro": "Palaquium hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's palaquium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, smooth-skinned fruits. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
