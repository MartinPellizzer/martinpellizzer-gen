    "intro": "Psychotria tacarcunensis, commonly known as the Tacarcunense Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many tropical plants known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
