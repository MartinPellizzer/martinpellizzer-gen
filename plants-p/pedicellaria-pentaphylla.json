    "intro": "Pedicellaria pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed pedicellaria, is a type of calcifying structure found on certain species of echinoids, particularly on sea urchins. It is a small, calcareous appendage that typically consists of a central axis with multiple lateral processes. These structures are primarily involved in defense, as they can be used to grasp and deter predators. The morphology of Pedicellaria pentaphylla is characterized by its five distinct lobes, which contribute to its common name. It plays a role in the ecological interactions of the host organism by providing mechanical protection."
