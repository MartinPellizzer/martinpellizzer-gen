    "intro": "Phoradendron granvillei, commonly known as the granville's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically eaten by birds, which then disperse its seeds to new host trees. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to ecological interactions within forest ecosystems."
