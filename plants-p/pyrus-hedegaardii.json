    "intro": "Pyrus hedegaardii, commonly known as the Hedegaard's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
