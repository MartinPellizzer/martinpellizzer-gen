    "intro": "Polypodium albicaulum, commonly known as the white-stemmed cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, white coating, which helps retain moisture. Polypodium albicaulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
