    "intro": "Picea abies var. inverta, commonly known as the Inverta fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The foliage is typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical Norway spruce, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in cooler, moist environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique form and hardiness."
