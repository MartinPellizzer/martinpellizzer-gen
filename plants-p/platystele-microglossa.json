    "intro": "Platystele microglossa, commonly known as the small-leafed platystele, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant has short, thick stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Platystele microglossa is known for its unique floral structures and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
