    "intro": "Polypodium leucosorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil, and thrives in humid environments with indirect light. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are usually leathery and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium leucosorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
