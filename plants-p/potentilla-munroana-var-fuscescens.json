    "intro": "Potentilla munroana var. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark-leaved potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, often glossy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
