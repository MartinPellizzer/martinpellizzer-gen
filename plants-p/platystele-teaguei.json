    "intro": "Platystele teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its unique, short, and often hidden rosette of leaves. The plant produces a single, delicate, white or pale green flower that emerges from the center of the rosette. It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Platystele teaguei is considered a vulnerable species."
