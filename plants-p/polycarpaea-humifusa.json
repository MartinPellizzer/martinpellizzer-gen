    "intro": "Polycarpaea humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features wiry stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems, aiding in water conservation. Polycarpaea humifusa is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
