    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. benacensis, commonly known as the Benacense cinquefoil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the cinquefoil genus. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled white flowers and dark green, finely toothed leaves. Native to the alpine regions of the Balkans, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after species in specialized horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
