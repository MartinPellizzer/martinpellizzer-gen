    "intro": "Polypodium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu polypody, is a fern native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its spores are released from small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium kinabaluense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
