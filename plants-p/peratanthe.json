    "intro": "Peratanthe, commonly known as the \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically herbaceous, with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. Peratanthe species often have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate floral displays."
