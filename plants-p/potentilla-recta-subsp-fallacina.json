    "intro": "Potentilla recta subsp. fallacina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a distinctive silvery underside that helps reflect sunlight. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
