    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. simpliciuscula, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. This variety is well adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
