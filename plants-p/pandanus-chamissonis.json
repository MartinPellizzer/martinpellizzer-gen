    "intro": "Pandanus chamissonis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. Pandanus chamissonis plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native regions."
