The plant typically produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Primula agleniana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add color to alpine gardens."
