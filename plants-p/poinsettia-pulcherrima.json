    "intro": "Poinsettia pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble flowers. The plant's true flowers are small, yellowish structures called cyathia, located at the center of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Poinsettias are popular holiday plants due to their striking appearance and seasonal availability."
