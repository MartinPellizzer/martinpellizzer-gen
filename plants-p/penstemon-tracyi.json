    "intro": "Penstemon tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats, such as cliffs and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tracy's beardtongue is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
