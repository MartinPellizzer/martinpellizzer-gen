    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria var. ternata, commonly known as the sand potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
