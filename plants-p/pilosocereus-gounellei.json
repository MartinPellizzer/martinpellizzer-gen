    "intro": "Pilosocereus gounellei, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange spines and a swollen, rounded stem that often features a colorful, non-photosynthetic top called a \"pseudostem.\" The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with its thick, fleshy stems that store water. It produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, and its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its sharp spines and specific care requirements."
