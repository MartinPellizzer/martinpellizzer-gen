    "intro": "Polycycnis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Polycycnis grandiflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
