    "intro": "Paepalanthus cassiae, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a unique bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence, which resembles a cup or a small flower cluster. The plant typically grows in rocky or sunny environments, often on cliffs or in open areas. Its leaves form a rosette that holds water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Paepalanthus cassiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
