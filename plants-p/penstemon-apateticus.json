    "intro": "Penstemon apateticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon apateticus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
