    "intro": "Psammisia recurvata, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Psammisia recurvata is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
