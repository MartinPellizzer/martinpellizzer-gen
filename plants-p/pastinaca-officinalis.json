    "intro": "Pastinaca officinalis, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, and its roots are cylindrical and often have a distinct, aromatic scent. Wild parsnip is known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat ailments such as respiratory and digestive issues. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
