    "intro": "Polystachya editae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved torch fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a waxy surface, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of spikelets, typical of the genus Polystachya. Polystachya editae is often found growing on trees in forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
