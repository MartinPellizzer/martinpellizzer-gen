    "intro": "Panicum dioicum, commonly known as yellow indigo, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Yellow indigo is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
