    "intro": "Peucedanum cuneifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers atop tall, hollow stems. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, open habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
