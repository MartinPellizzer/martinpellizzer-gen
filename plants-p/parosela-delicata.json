    "intro": "Parosela delicata, commonly known as the delicate parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
