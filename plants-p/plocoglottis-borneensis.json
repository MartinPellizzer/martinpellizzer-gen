    "intro": "Plocoglottis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks and branches of trees in the dense canopy. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study in its natural habitat."
