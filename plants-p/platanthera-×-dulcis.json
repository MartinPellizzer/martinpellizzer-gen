    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 dulcis, commonly known as the sweet ladies' tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to moist woodlands in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear dense, fragrant inflorescences of white to pale green flowers. The plant's leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in shaded, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
