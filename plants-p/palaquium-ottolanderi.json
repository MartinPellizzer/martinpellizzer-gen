    "intro": "Palaquium ottolanderi, commonly known as the Otto's wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are covered in a waxy coating, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Palaquium ottolanderi is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
