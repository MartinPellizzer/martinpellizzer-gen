    "intro": "Picea chihuahuana subsp. martinezii, commonly known as the Chihuahua fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
