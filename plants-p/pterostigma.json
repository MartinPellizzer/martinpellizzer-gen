    "intro": "Pterostigma, commonly known as the \"stigma\" in some plant species, is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants. It is typically a small, dark-colored spot located at the base of the stigma, which plays a role in pollen recognition and fertilization. This structure is often composed of a thickened, glandular tissue that secretes substances aiding in the bonding of pollen grains. The presence and characteristics of pterostigma can vary among species, influencing pollination efficiency. It is an important feature for taxonomic identification in some plant families."
