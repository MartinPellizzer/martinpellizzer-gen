    "intro": "Piqueria myriadenia, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its drought-prone environment. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Piqueria myriadenia is often found in rocky soils and is a member of the Malvaceae family."
