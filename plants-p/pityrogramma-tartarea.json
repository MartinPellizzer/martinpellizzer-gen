    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive fan-like shape, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America."
