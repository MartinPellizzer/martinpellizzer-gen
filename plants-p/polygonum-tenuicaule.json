    "intro": "Polygonum tenuicaule, commonly known as slender knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
