    "intro": "Polystichum kropfii, commonly known as the Kropf's fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
