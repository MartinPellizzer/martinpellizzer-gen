    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
