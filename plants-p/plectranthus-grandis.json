    "intro": "Plectranthus grandis, commonly known as the Cape verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Plectranthus grandis is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates."
