    "intro": "Pedicularis crenata var. crenatiformis, commonly known as the wavy-leaved lousewort, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred structure. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its wavy leaf margins and is a member of the Orobanchaceae family."
