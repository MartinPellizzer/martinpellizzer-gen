    "intro": "Pisonia membranacea, commonly known as the paperflower or flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, papery flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, which are often arranged in clusters. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia membranacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
