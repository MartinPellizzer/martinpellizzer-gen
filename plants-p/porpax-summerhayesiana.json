    "intro": "Porpax summerhayesiana, commonly known as the Summerhayes' porpax, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
