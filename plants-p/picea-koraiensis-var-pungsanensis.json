    "intro": "Picea koraiensis var. pungsanensis, commonly known as the Pungsan fir, is a rare and cold-hardy conifer native to the mountainous regions of North Korea. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
