    "intro": "Polypodium wendlandii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape, giving the plant its common name."
