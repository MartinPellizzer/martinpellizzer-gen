    "intro": "Pyrethrum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fine, powdery seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of white, powdery substance, which gives it its common name. Pyrethrum pulverulentum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and unique seed dispersal mechanism."
