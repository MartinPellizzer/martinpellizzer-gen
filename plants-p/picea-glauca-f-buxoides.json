    "intro": "Picea glauca f. buxoides, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub that exhibits a dense, rounded form. It is a naturally occurring form of the white spruce (Picea glauca), characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical tree form. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the dark bark. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design for its neat, compact shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
