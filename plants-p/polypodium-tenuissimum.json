    "intro": "Polypodium tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. Its spores are released from small, fleshy sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves. Polypodium tenuissimum is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
