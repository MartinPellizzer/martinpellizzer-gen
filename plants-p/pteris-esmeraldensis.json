    "intro": "Pteris esmeraldensis, commonly known as the Emerald Brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. This plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silvery hairs. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside. Pteris esmeraldensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
