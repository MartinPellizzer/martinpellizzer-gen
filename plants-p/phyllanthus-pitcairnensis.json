    "intro": "Phyllanthus pitcairnensis, commonly known as Pitcairn gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific islands, particularly Pitcairn Island. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to island ecosystems."
