    "intro": "Panicum ciliatiflorum, commonly known as the silky panic grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the fine hairs covering its foliage. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are adorned with delicate, ciliate (fringed) florets, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
