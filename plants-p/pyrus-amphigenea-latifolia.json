    "intro": "Pyrus amphigenea latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to common pears but are less widely cultivated. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in gardens and parks."
