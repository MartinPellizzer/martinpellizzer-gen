    "intro": "Panphalea araucariophila, commonly known as the Araucariophila fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
