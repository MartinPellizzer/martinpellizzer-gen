    "intro": "Primula alsophila, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and prominent yellow stamens, blooming in early spring. Primula alsophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
