    "intro": "Pitardia, commonly known as the golden star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials, often found in dry, open habitats. Pitardia species have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flower heads that attract pollinators. They are valued in horticulture for their vibrant color and ornamental appeal."
