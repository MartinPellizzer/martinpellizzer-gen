    "intro": "Praecereus euchlorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and gardeners."
