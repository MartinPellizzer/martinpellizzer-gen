    "intro": "Physalis puberula, commonly known as the woolly groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange calyces that enclose the fruit. The plant produces small, round, orange berries that are edible when fully ripe. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white pubescence. Physalis puberula thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
