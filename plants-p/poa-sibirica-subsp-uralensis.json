It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in arctic and alpine regions."
