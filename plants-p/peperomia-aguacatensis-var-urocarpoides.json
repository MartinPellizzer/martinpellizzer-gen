It features glossy, dark green leaves with a striking purple underside, which adds visual interest to indoor spaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by unique, elongated fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
