    "intro": "Pedicularis axillaris, commonly known as the axillary monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive hooded shape. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
