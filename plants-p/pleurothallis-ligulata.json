    "intro": "Pleurothallis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
