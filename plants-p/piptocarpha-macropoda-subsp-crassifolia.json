    "intro": "Piptocarpha macropoda subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in disturbed or dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
