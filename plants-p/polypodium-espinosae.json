    "intro": "Polypodium espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is covered in a thick, fibrous layer, which helps it anchor in soil and retain moisture. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns."
