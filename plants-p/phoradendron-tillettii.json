It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds. Its berries, which are orange-red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
