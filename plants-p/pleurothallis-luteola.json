    "intro": "Pleurothallis luteola, commonly known as the yellow pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically exhibit a yellow or yellow-green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis luteola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
