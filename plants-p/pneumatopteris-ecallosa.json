    "intro": "Pneumatopteris ecallosa, commonly known as the smooth fronds fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Pteridaceae family. Pneumatopteris ecallosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
