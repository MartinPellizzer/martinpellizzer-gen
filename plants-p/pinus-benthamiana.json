    "intro": "Pinus benthamiana, commonly known as the Bentham's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high altitudes of the Western Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically 5 to 7 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that are cylindrical and often have a reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
