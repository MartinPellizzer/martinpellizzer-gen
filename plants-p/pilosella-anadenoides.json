    "intro": "Pilosella anadenoides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features dense, woolly gray-green foliage, which helps it retain heat in cold environments. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense heads, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Pilosella anadenoides is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude ecosystems."
