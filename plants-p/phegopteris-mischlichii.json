It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three feet. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in wetland environments. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
