    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. tuberosa, commonly known as the silverweed or tuberous silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a creeping growth habit and often forms dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or alpine environments. The tuberous roots of this plant are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
