    "intro": "Peracarpa carnosa var. kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to southern China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
