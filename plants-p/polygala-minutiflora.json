    "intro": "Polygala minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Polygala minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
