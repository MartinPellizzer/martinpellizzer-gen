    "intro": "Pteris semiadnata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized indusium. Pteris semiadnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
