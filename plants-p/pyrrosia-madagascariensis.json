    "intro": "Pyrrosia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and lance-shaped. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Pyrrosia madagascariensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
