    "intro": "Peperomia trullifolia, commonly known as the rosette peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features dense, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that form a tight rosette at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia trullifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
