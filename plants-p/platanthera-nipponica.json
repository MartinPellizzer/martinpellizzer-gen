    "intro": "Platanthera nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
