    "intro": "Poa triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three florets each. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. Poa triflora is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
