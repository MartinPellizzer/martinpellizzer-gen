It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lanceolate foliage, which contribute to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
