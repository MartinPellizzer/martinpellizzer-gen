    "intro": "Phoebe cuneata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth phoebe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries that turn red in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The smooth phoebe is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
