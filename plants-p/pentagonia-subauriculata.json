    "intro": "Pentagonia subauriculata, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the late spring or early summer. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Pentagonia subauriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
