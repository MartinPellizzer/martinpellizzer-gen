    "intro": "Potentilla officinalis, commonly known as common cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla officinalis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
