    "intro": "Potentilla verlotii, commonly known as the Verlot's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh mountain conditions. Potentilla verlotii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
