    "intro": "Pinus montana var. plana, commonly known as the flat-topped pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, flat-topped crown, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are often reddish-brown in hue. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its unique shape and hardiness."
