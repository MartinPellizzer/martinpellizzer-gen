    "intro": "Panicum bunophilum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brownish panicles as its inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Panicum bunophilum is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
