    "intro": "Peltogyne gracilipes, commonly known as the slender tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
