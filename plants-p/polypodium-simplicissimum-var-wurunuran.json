    "intro": "Polypodium simplicissimum var. wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran holly fern, is a tropical fern native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arching and feather-shaped. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
