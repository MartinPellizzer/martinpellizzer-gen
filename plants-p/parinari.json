    "intro": "Parinari, commonly known as the \"wild apple\" or \"mango tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chrysobalanaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is usually a drupe, often with a sweet, edible pulp, though it may be somewhat tart or astringent. Parinari species are valued for their ornamental appeal and, in some cases, for their edible fruits and medicinal properties."
