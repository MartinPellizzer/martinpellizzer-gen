    "intro": "Ptilotus stirlingii var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf silverflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features dense clusters of small, silky white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat stress reduction. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy choice for dryland gardens."
