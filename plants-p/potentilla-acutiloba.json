    "intro": "Potentilla acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, five-lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Potentilla acutiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
