    "intro": "Paphiopedilum victoria-regina subsp. primulinum, commonly known as the Victoria Regina Primulinum orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that resembles a small, elongated pouch. The plant typically produces pendulous, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, with a distinctive golden or yellowish hue in the sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid gardens and conservation programs."
