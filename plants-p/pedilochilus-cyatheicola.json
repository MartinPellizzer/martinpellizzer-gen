    "intro": "Pedilochilus cyatheicola, commonly known as the giant feather orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea and northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and its large, pinnate leaves that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
