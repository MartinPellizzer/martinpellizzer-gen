    "intro": "Platanthera bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, often unbranched stem and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a single lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
