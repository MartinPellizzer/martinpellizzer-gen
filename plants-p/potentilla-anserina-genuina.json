    "intro": "Potentilla anserina genuina, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
