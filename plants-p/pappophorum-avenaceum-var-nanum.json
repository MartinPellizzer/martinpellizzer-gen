    "intro": "Pappophorum avenaceum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in silky, hair-like structures called pappus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to stabilize soil."
