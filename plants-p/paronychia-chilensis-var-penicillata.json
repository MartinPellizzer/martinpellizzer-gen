    "intro": "Paronychia chilensis var. penicillata, commonly known as the Chilean sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It features a dense mat of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy and coastal soils, thriving in full sun and tolerating salt spray. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
