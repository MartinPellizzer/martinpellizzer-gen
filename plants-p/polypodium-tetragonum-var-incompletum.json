    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. incompletum, commonly known as the incomplete cliff fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its compact growth habit and fronds that are typically shorter and more upright than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
