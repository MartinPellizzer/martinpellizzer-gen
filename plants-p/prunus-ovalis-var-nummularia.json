    "intro": "Prunus ovalis var. nummularia, commonly known as the Japanese maple or Nummularia maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that resemble coins, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to landscape designs."
