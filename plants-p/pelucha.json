    "intro": "Pelucha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Pelucha is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and recognizable species within the family Malvaceae."
