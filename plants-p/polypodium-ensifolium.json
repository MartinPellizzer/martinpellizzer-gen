    "intro": "Polypodium ensifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, slender, and serrated fronds that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium ensifolium thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests and shaded woodlands."
