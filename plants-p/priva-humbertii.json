    "intro": "Priva humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, oval berries. Priva humbertii thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
