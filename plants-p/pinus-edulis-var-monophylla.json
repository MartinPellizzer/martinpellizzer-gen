    "intro": "Pinus edulis var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf pinyon, is a variant of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive single leaflets on each branch, which set it apart from other pinyon species. The plant produces edible seeds, known as pinyon nuts, which are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high elevations. The tree is also an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
