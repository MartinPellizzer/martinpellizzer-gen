    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
