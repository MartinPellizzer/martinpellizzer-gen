    "intro": "Psychotria longiflora, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated, tubular flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that contains toxic alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and ceremonial practices."
