It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically purple to reddish in color. The plant has rhizomes, which contribute to its ability to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
