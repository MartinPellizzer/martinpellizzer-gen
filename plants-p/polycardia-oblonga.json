    "intro": "Polycardia oblonga, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or arrowhead plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and tuberous roots, which are the primary parts used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Polycardia oblonga has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
