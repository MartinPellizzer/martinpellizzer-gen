    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 brabantica, commonly known as the Brabant poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus nigra and Populus tremula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, often pendulous branches. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found near rivers and streams. It produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via water, contributing to its spread along riparian zones. The bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
