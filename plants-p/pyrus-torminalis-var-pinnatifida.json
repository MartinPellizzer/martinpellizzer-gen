It is characterized by its finely serrated, pinnatifid leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically white or yellow, with a crisp, juicy texture and a mild, sweet flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit in temperate climates."
