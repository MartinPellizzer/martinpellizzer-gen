    "intro": "Penstemon glaucus var. stenosepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled bluebell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds."
