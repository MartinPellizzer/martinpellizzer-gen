    "intro": "Passiflora \u00d7 cardinalis, commonly known as the Cardinal Climber, is a hybrid species of passionflower native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble cardinal feathers, which are actually modified sepals. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers with a distinctive crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, while edible, is less commonly consumed compared to other passionfruit species."
