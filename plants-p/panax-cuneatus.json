    "intro": "Panax cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the temperate forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Panax cuneatus is valued for its medicinal properties, with roots containing compounds believed to have adaptogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
