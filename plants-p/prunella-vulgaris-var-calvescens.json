    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. calvescens, commonly known as narrow-leaved selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually narrower than those of the typical Prunella vulgaris. Its flowers are small, blue-violet, and clustered in whorls along the stem, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The species is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing qualities."
