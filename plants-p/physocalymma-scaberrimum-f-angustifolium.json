    "intro": "Physocalymma scaberrimum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed physocalymma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, violet to purple petals that attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically covered in fine pubescence, which may aid in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
