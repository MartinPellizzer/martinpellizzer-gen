    "intro": "Pollinirhiza ovata, commonly known as the ovate root vine, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
