    "intro": "Pilocereus schottii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Pilocereus schottii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
