    "intro": "Pastinaca graveolens, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine and can be cooked as a vegetable. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
