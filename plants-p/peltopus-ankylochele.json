    "intro": "Peltopus ankylochele, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Peltopus ankylochele is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
