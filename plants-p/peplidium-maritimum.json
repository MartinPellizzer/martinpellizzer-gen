    "intro": "Peplidium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in dense heads, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to stabilize sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in maritime climates."
