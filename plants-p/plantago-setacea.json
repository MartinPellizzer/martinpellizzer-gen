    "intro": "Plantago setacea, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, wavy, and hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and persistent weed in many regions."
