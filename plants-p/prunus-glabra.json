    "intro": "Prunus glabra, commonly known as the smooth cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red drupes. Prunus glabra is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
