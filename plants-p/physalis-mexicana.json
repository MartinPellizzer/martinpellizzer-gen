It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries enclosed in a papery calyx that turns red as the fruit matures. These berries are edible when fully ripe and have a tart, tangy flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a minor food crop in some regions."
