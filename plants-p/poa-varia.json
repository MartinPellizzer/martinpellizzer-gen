    "intro": "Poa varia, commonly known as variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa varia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common species in various ecological settings."
