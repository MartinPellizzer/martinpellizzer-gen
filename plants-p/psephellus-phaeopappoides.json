    "intro": "Psephellus phaeopappoides, commonly known as the brown pappus sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its yellow ray florets are surrounded by a brown, fluffy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas."
