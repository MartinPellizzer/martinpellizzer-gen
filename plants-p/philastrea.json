    "intro": "Philastrea, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fragrant wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fruit resembling a capsule. Philastrea species are valued for their aromatic wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, many species are now endangered and protected in their native habitats."
