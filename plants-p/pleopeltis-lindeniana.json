    "intro": "Pleopeltis lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindenberg's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
