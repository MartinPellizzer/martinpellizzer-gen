It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
