    "intro": "Pleopeltis linealifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain water in its natural habitat."
