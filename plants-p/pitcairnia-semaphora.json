    "intro": "Pitcairnia semaphora, commonly known as the signal fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, waxy, green leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange bracts, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia semaphora is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
