    "intro": "Plantaginella aquatica, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Plantaginella aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
