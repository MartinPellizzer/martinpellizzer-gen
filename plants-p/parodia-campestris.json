    "intro": "Parodia campestris, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Plains,\" is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of long, white, hair-like spines that cover the plant's surface. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening and lasting only a short time. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments."
