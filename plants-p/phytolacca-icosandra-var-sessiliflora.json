    "intro": "Phytolacca icosandra var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered pokeweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by dark red, fleshy berries. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic. This variant is distinguished by its sessile (nearly leafless) inflorescence, setting it apart from other varieties of Phytolacca."
