    "intro": "Phelypaea arenaria var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it helps stabilize sand. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
