    "intro": "Pyrrosia subtruncata, commonly known as the truncated spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with fleshy, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its fronds are typically unifacial, with a dense covering of tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of the fronds in clusters."
