    "intro": "Paspalum excavatum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to light green flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Paspalum excavatum is often used in erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to establish quickly."
