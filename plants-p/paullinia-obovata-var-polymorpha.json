    "intro": "Paullinia obovata var. polymorpha, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
