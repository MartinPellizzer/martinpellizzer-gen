    "intro": "Peperomia rubioides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf red peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or maroon hue on the undersides. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or green, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
