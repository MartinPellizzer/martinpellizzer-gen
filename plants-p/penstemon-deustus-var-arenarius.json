It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
