    "intro": "Pinus hwangshanensis subsp. transfluminea, commonly known as the Hwangshan pine variant, is a rare and endemic conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are usually pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers cooler, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
