    "intro": "Pinus canadensis var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-barked Canadian pine, is a variant of the Canadian pine characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark. It is native to the western regions of North America, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. The tree typically grows as a tall, straight conifer with a conical shape, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its needles are long and blue-green in color, and it produces small, edible cones that contain seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
