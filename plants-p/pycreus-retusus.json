    "intro": "Pycreus retusus, commonly known as the rough pycreus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
