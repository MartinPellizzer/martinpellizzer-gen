    "intro": "Pouzolzia tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged pouzolzia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls of four, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules. Pouzolzia tetraptera is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures."
