    "intro": "Potentilla calcicola, commonly known as the limestone potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its natural environment. Potentilla calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid areas."
