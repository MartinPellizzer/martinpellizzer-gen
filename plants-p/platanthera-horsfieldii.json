    "intro": "Platanthera horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a striking, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often growing in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its elegant appearance."
