    "intro": "Phymatocarpus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent stems and small, often clustered flowers. The fruits are pod-like structures that contain seeds, and the plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Phymatocarpus species play a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
