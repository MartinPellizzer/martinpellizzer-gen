    "intro": "Podosemum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican podosemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though its ecological role in native habitats remains understudied."
