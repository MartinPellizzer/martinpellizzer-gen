    "intro": "Psidium sieberianum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible fruits similar to guavas, though smaller and more acidic in flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The plant is also valued for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different gardening conditions."
