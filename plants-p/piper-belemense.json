    "intro": "Piper belemense, commonly known as the Belem pepper or Belem pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries are used in traditional medicine and have a sharp, spicy flavor similar to other members of the Piper genus. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
