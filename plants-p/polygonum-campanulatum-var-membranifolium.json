    "intro": "Polygonum campanulatum var. membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous-leaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are thin and membranous, giving the plant its specific variety name, and they often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of swamps. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed production."
