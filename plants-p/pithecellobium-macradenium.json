It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
