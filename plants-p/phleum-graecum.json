    "intro": "Phleum graecum, commonly known as Greek barley, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Phleum graecum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional agriculture."
