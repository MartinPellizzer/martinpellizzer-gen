    "intro": "Phyteuma hemisphaericum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive bell-shaped corolla, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
