    "intro": "Pteris pluricaudata, commonly known as the many-tailed brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris pluricaudata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
