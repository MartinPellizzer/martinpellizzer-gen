    "intro": "Primula concinna, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in early spring. Primula concinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
