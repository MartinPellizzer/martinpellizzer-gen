    "intro": "Potentilla alchimilloides var. ghatica, commonly known as the Ghatic alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to its alpine habitat. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
