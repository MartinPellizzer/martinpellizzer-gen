    "intro": "Pilosella aplotea, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pilosella aplotea produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies."
