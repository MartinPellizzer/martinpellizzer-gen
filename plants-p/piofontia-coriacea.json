    "intro": "Piofontia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved piofontia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, bark-like texture, providing structural support and protection against herbivores. Piofontia coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
