    "intro": "Phalaris minor, commonly known as lesser quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Phalaris minor is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
