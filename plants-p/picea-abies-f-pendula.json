    "intro": "Picea abies f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Norway spruce, is a unique cultivar of the Norway spruce characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This ornamental tree exhibits a distinctive, flowing appearance due to its elongated, pendulous shoots that create a waterfall-like effect. Botanically, it retains the typical coniferous features of the species, including needle-like leaves and cones, but its growth habit is significantly modified. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, and it is relatively hardy, though it may require protection in colder climates."
