    "intro": "Pygmaeopremna herbacea var. thailandica, commonly known as the Thai dwarf premna, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, particularly in Thailand and neighboring countries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
