    "intro": "Pseudocentrum macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it requires careful care and is not commonly found in the wild."
