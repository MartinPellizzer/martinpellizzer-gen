    "intro": "Potentilla bifurca f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-blue foliage. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a waxy, bluish-green appearance due to a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in gardens."
