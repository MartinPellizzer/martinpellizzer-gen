    "intro": "Phlegmariurus hippuris, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming, non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive thimble-shaped structure formed by the fusion of its gametophyte leaves. Its morphology includes a central stalk with overlapping leaf-like structures that enclose the sporophyte. Phlegmariurus hippuris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
