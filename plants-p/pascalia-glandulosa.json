    "intro": "Pascalia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pascalia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Pascalia glandulosa is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
