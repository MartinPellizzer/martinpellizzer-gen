    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. karakoramensis, commonly known as the Karakoram potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram mountain range. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
