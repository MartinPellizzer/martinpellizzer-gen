It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds with a narrow, linear shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
