    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 procumbentoides, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features low, spreading growth with many slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
