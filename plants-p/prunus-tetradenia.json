    "intro": "Prunus tetradenia, commonly known as the four-lobed cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive four-lobed leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. Prunus tetradenia prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
