    "intro": "Piper quiriguanum, commonly known as the Quirigu\u00e1n pepper, is a member of the Piperaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and aromatic leaves. Native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the peppery seeds used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in local remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
