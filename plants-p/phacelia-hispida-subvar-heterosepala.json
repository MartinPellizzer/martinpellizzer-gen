    "intro": "Phacelia hispida subvar. heterosepala, commonly known as the rough phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a candidate for ecological restoration projects."
