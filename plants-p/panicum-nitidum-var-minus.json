    "intro": "Panicum nitidum var. minus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually striking in ornamental landscapes. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for erosion control and native plant gardens."
