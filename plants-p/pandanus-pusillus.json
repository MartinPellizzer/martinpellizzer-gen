    "intro": "Pandanus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than one meter, with slender, sword-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, white flowers, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments. Pandanus pusillus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
