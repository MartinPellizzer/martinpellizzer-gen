    "intro": "Polypodium polyxiphion, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium polyxiphion is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
