    "intro": "Poecilopteris heteroclita, commonly known as the heteroclite fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Filicales. It is characterized by its complex fronds with dichotomous branching and a distinctive arrangement of sori. The plant's leaves are typically large and pinnately divided, with a structure indicative of its position in the late Paleozoic flora. Poecilopteris heteroclita is often found in coal-bearing strata and is used as an index fossil for dating sedimentary rocks. Its botanical features provide important insights into the evolution of ferns and ancient ecosystems."
