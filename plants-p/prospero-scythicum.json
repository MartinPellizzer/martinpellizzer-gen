    "intro": "Prospero scythicum, commonly known as the Scythian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
