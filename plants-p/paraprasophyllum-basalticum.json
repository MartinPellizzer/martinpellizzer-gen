    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in basaltic rock formations. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water in arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered blooms that are typically pale green or white. Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of volcanic soil ecosystems."
