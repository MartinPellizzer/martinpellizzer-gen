    "intro": "Potentilla semiloba, commonly known as the western sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla semiloba is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
