    "intro": "Paspalum oxyanthum, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it a distinctive ornamental plant. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in dense panicles, typically in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in dry, sandy soils. Its low maintenance and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
