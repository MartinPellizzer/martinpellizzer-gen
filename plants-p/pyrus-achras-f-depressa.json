    "intro": "Pyrus achras f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese white pear, is a compact, ornamental variant of the Chinese white pear. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to regular pears but are less commonly cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. This form is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
