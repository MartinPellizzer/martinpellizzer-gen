    "intro": "Pinalia ignea, commonly known as the fiery flame plant, is a flowering species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Pinalia ignea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
