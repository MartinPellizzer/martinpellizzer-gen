    "intro": "Populus glauca, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Populus glauca is also known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals."
