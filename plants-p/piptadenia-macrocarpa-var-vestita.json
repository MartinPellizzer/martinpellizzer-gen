    "intro": "Piptadenia macrocarpa var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet pod tree, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, hairy pods that give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in thick, woody pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
