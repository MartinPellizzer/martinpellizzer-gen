    "intro": "Phacelia virgata var. ampliata, commonly known as the broadleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and rocky habitats. This plant is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
