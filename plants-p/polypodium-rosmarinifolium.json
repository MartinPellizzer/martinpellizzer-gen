    "intro": "Polypodium rosmarinifolium, commonly known as the marjoram fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The marjoram fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
