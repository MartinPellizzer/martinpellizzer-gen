    "intro": "Paphiopedilum zulhermanianum, commonly known as the Zulherman Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highlands of Borneo. It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves and produces a single, showy spike with several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a unique lip that is not fully fused to the column, a characteristic feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
