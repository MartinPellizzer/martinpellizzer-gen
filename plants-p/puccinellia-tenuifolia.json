    "intro": "Puccinellia tenuifolia, commonly known as slender glassworts, is a low-growing perennial grass found in saline and coastal environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to tolerate high levels of salt and is often found in marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats. Its root system helps stabilize soil in these harsh environments. Puccinellia tenuifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and preventing erosion."
