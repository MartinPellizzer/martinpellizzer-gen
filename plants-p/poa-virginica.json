    "intro": "Poa virginica, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in sandy or coastal soils. This plant is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dunes and maritime environments. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Poa virginica plays an important ecological role in coastal habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
