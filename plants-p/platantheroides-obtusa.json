    "intro": "Platantheroides obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-lipped twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, short flowering stem that bears a single, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a specialized root system that forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
