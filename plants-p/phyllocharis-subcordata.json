    "intro": "Phyllocharis subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. Phyllocharis subcordata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
