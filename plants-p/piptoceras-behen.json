    "intro": "Piptoceras behen, commonly known as beheniate, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous husk, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of behenate, a fatty acid derivative. The plant is also valued for its potential industrial applications due to its unique chemical composition."
