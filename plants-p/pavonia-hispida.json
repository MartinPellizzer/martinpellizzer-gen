    "intro": "Pavonia hispida, commonly known as the rough pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Pavonia hispida is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks."
