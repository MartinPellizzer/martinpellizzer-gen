    "intro": "Paspalum dasytrichum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Paspalum dasytrichum is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop in some regions."
