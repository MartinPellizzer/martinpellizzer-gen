    "intro": "Polystichum thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese Shield Fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features dark green, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum thunbergii is valued for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
