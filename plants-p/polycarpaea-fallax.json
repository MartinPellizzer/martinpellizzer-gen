    "intro": "Polycarpaea fallax, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid environments. It produces multiple flower stalks from the base, giving it the common name \"fallax,\" which refers to its tendency to bloom repeatedly. Polycarpaea fallax requires indirect sunlight and well-draining soil to thrive."
