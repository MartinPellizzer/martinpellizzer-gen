    "intro": "Phaeneilema pulneyense, commonly known as the Pulney's phaeneilema, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a range of vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeneilema pulneyense is considered a conservation concern."
