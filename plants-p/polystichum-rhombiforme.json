    "intro": "Polystichum rhombiforme, commonly known as the rhombic wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The fronds are bipinnate, with pinnae that are rhombic in shape, giving the plant its common name. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
