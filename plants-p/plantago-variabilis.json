    "intro": "Plantago variabilis, commonly known as variable plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. This versatile plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to colonize and stabilize soil."
