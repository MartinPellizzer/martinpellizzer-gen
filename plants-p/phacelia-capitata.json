    "intro": "Phacelia capitata, commonly known as bluehead phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Phacelia capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
