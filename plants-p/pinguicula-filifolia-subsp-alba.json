    "intro": "Pinguicula filifolia subsp. alba, commonly known as the white-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on a slender stalk. It thrives in moist, boggy environments and requires high humidity to maintain its carnivorous adaptations. Its specialized leaves not only capture prey but also aid in water retention, making it well-suited to its wetland habitat."
