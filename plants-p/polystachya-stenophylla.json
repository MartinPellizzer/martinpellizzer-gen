    "intro": "Polystachya stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed polystachya, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Polystachya stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
