    "intro": "Primula borealis var. loczyi, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette of basal leaves, which help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
