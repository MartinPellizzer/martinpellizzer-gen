    "intro": "Pituranthos scoparius, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and coastal environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pituranthos scoparius plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
