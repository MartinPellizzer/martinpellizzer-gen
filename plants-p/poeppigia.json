    "intro": "Poeppigia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their unique, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Poeppigia species typically have a short, thick stem and are often covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, narrow tube and showy, reflexed petals. They are prized for their unusual appearance and are often cultivated as ornamental plants."
