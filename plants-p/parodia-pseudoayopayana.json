    "intro": "Parodia pseudoayopayana, commonly known as the Baja Desert Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Baja California region of Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant features white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically during the rainy season. It has a dense covering of white spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. This species is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
