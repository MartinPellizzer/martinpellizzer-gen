    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its medicinal or narcotic properties. The plant features smooth, dark green leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain seeds used in horticulture. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its relation to the opium poppy, it is subject to strict regulations in many countries."
