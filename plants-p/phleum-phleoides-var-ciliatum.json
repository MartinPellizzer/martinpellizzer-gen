    "intro": "Phleum phleoides var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy timothy, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
