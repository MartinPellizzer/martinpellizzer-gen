    "intro": "Potentilla supina terrestris, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in cymes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
