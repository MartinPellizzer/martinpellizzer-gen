    "intro": "Paranomus laxus, commonly known as the slender parasol mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Pluteaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, umbrella-shaped cap that is usually pale yellow to cream in color. The gills are attached to the stem and are typically pale yellow, fading to white as the mushroom matures. It grows in association with certain trees, particularly in temperate forest ecosystems. This species is often found on decaying wood, where it plays a role in the decomposition process."
