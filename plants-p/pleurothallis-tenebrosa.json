    "intro": "Pleurothallis tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in shaded, humid environments within the rainforest canopy. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
