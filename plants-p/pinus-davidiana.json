    "intro": "Pinus davidiana, commonly known as the David's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that are often reddish-brown and remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The David's pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
