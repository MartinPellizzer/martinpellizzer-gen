    "intro": "Pleurimaria quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover of the Mediterranean, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, four-lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
