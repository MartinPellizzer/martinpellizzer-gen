    "intro": "Plantago vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal\u2019s plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its seeds are encased in a tough, capsule-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional remedies for respiratory and digestive ailments."
