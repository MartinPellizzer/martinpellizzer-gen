    "intro": "Polystichum richardii, commonly known as the Richard's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Polystichum richardii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
