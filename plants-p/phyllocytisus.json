    "intro": "Phyllocytisus, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. These shrubs are characterized by their small, oval leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside, giving them their common name. They produce small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The fruits are small, reddish berries that ripen in the summer and are attractive to birds. Phyllocytisus species are native to Europe and are often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
