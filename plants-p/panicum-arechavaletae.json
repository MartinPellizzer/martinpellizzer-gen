    "intro": "Panicum arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
