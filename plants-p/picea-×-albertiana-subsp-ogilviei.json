    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 albertiana subsp. ogilviei, commonly known as the Ogilvie spruce, is a hybrid conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The cones are typically small and woody, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for horticultural purposes."
