    "intro": "Pinus sativa, commonly known as the Turkish pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pinus sativa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
