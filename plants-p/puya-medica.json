    "intro": "Puya medica, commonly known as the medicinal puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a visually striking species. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Puya medica is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
