    "intro": "Paspalum platense, commonly known as the river paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Paspalum platense is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
