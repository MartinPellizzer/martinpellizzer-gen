It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Phyllanthus perpusillus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
