    "intro": "Polypodium crenulatum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The fern's elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
