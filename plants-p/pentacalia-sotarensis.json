    "intro": "Pentacalia sotarensis, commonly known as the Sotara pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sotara in the southern Caribbean. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of soft hair, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentacalia sotarensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
