    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. apiculata, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of other spruce species. The cones are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for several years, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types, making it a hardy and widely cultivated species. The tree is also valued for its timber and its role in forest ecosystems."
