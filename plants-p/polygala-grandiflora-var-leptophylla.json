It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
