    "intro": "Pouzolzia calophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf pouzolzia, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
