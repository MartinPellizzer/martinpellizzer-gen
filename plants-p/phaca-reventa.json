    "intro": "Phaca reventa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, dark seeds. Due to overharvesting, Phaca reventa is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
