    "intro": "Phyllanthus mocinoanus, commonly known as the Mexican gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Phyllanthus mocinoanus is valued both for its ornamental qualities and for its use in traditional medicine."
