It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its latex sap is viscous and can cause skin irritation."
