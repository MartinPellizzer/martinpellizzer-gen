    "intro": "Papaver wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to bright red, often with a contrasting central area. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from the elements. The seeds of Papaver wallichii are enclosed in a hard, capsule-like structure that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds over a wide area."
