    "intro": "Pteris zahlbruckneriana, commonly known as the Zahnbr\u00fcckner's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green to bluish-green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
