It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have distinctive white or pale green margins, giving them a \"winged\" appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. This plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
