    "intro": "Plantago macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in meadows, and is valued for its medicinal properties."
