    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 mucrolentum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum munitum. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
