    "intro": "Pithecellobium pallens, commonly known as the white acacia, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves composed of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
