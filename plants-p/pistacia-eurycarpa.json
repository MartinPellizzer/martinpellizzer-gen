    "intro": "Pistacia eurycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruit pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive, edible drupes that turn red or purple as they mature. Its fruits are valued for their flavor and are often used in culinary applications. The plant is adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
