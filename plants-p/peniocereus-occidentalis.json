    "intro": "Peniocereus occidentalis, commonly known as the Western night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant that typically grows to a height of 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reflect sunlight. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
