    "intro": "Pyrus korshinskyi subsp. daschtidshumica, commonly known as the Dashtidshumic pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically used in local cuisines. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
