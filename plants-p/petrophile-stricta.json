    "intro": "Petrophile stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Petrophile stricta is an important component of the flora in its native habitat, contributing to the ecological diversity of rocky and coastal areas."
