    "intro": "Platystachys geniculata, commonly known as the golden dewdrop or silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features slender, arching stems that often trail or climb, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and silver-veined. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display. It is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
