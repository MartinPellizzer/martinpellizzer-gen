    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. salsa, commonly known as sea plantain, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
