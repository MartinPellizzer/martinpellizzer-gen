    "intro": "Psittacanthus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran cycad, is a unique cycad species native to El Salvador. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
