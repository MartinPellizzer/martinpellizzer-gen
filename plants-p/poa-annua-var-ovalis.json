    "intro": "Poa annua var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass. It is a low-growing, grass-like plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the standard Poa annua. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
