    "intro": "Paullinia quitensis, commonly known as the Amazonian soursop or *cacao* relative, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or yellow depending on the variety. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in traditional medicine. However, it is not as widely cultivated or studied as other members of its family."
