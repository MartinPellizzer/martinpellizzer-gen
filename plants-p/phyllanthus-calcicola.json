    "intro": "Phyllanthus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Phyllanthus calcicola is often found in rocky outcrops and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
