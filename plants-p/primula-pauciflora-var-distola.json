It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
