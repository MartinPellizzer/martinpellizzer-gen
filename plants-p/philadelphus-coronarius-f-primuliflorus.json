    "intro": "Philadelphus coronarius f. primuliflorus, commonly known as the early-flowering mock orange, is a cultivar of the Philadelphus genus native to Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom earlier than the typical species, often in late spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or as a shrub. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
