    "intro": "Peltapteris tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiales. It thrived during the Carboniferous period and is characterized by its complex, lobed fronds that resemble modern-day ferns. The plant's structure includes a rhizome with adventitious roots and large, pinnately divided leaves. Its spores were dispersed by wind, contributing to the development of early forest ecosystems. Fossil records of Peltapteris tripartita provide valuable insights into ancient plant evolution and paleoenvironments."
