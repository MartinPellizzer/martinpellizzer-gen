    "intro": "Petrosedum amplexicaule subsp. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish stonecrop, is a low-growing, evergreen succulent native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
