    "intro": "Parapantadenia chauvetiae, commonly known as the Chauvet's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers are typically small, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
