    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and leaves with finely divided, pinnatifid (narrowly lobed) margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
