    "intro": "Phyllanthus niruri var. debilis, commonly known as stonebreaker or pazol, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along trails, thriving in humid, warm climates. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environments, though it is less robust than the typical Phyllanthus niruri."
