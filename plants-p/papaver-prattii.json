    "intro": "Papaver prattii, commonly known as the Pratt's poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting black or purple center. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Papaver prattii is a member of the Papaveraceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value."
