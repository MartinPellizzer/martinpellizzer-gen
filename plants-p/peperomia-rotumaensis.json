    "intro": "Peperomia rotumaensis, commonly known as the Rotuma peperomia, is a rare species native to the island of Rotuma in the South Pacific. It is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
