    "intro": "Pterostylis scapula, commonly known as the scapular duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, narrow flower spike that typically bears one to three pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys, often growing on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its flowers have a distinctive, elongated labellum that resembles a duck's bill, giving it its common name. The orchid is pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its scent and color."
