    "intro": "Potentilla flabellifolia var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and showy blooms."
