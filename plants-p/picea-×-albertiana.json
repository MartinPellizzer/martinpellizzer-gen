    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 albertiana, commonly known as the Alberta white spruce, is a hybrid conifer native to Canada. It is a cross between Picea glauca and Picea mariana, resulting in a tree that combines traits from both parent species. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are typically 4\u20136 inches long. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. The Alberta white spruce is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
