    "intro": "Polypodium glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's sword fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, sword-like appearance, which contributes to its ornamental value."
