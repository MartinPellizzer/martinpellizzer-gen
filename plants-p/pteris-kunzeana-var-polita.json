    "intro": "Pteris kunzeana var. polita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
