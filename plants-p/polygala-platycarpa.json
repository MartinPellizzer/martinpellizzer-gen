It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
