    "intro": "Piscidia acuminata, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and pinnately veined, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its showy, fragrant flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming during the dry season. The tree produces small, hard, brown seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind."
