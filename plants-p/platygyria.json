    "intro": "Platygyria, commonly known as the flatleaf fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their flat, broad leaves and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Platygyria species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread vegetatively. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
