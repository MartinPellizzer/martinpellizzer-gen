    "intro": "Polypodium raciborskii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface and establish dense colonies. It is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it can tolerate a range of water conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form mats, it can become a significant component of aquatic ecosystems."
