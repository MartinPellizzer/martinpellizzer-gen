    "intro": "Primula sedifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
