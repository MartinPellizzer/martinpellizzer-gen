    "intro": "Perezia pedicularidifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved perezia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. Its flowers are small, white to pale green, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
