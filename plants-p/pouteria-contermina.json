    "intro": "Pouteria contermina, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. These seeds, often referred to as \"Brazil nuts,\" are rich in nutrients and have a high oil content. Pouteria contermina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
