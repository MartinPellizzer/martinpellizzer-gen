It is characterized by its silver-white, hairy leaves that are narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.
