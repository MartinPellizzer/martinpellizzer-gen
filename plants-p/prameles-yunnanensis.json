    "intro": "Prameles yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan prameles, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prameles yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
