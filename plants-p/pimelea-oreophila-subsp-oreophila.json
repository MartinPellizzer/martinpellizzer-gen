    "intro": "Pimelea oreophila subsp. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, often on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The species is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
