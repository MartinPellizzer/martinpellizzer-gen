    "intro": "Pilosella auriculina, commonly known as the auriculate pilosella, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and have auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The yellow flowers bloom in summer, producing small, inconspicuous florets surrounded by ray florets."
