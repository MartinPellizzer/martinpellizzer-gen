It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically features a short, wiry stem with several clustered flowers, each having a pouch-like lip. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
