    "intro": "Penstemon militaris, commonly known as the military penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, tubular flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon militaris is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
