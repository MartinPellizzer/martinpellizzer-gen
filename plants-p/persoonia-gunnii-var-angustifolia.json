It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, angular leaves and distinctive yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is a shrub that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with its foliage often appearing ghostly due to its pale coloration. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
