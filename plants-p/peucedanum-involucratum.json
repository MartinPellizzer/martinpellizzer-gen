    "intro": "Peucedanum involucratum, commonly known as the clustered cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, containing compounds similar to those found in parsley and anise. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Peucedanum involucratum is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many edible and medicinal plants."
