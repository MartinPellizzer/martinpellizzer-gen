    "intro": "Pleopeltis leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
