    "intro": "Phyllostachys longiciliata, commonly known as the silver bamboo, is a fast-growing grass species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, hollow stalks that are covered in a silvery-white layer of fine hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by feathery seed clusters. This bamboo is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also valued for its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
