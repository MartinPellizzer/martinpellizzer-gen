It features a dense spike of small, fragrant white flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant is notable for its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and bogs. This orchid is often found in the northeastern United States and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss."
