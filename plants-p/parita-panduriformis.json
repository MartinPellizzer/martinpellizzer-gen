It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
