    "intro": "Pleopeltis batacorum, commonly known as the Batacorum rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its natural habitat. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of dense vegetation."
