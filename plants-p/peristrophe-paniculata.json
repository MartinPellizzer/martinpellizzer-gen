It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often adorned with delicate, pale green or yellowish florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.
