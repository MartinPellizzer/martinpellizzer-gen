    "intro": "Psiadia coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apocynaceae family. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Psiadia coarctata is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun."
