    "intro": "Potentilla soongorica f. multicaulis, commonly known as the multicaulis potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed structure and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
