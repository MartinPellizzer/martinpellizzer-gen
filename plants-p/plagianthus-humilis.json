    "intro": "Plagianthus humilis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Plagianthaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
