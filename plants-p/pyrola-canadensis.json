    "intro": "Pyrola canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian pink or white wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen appearance. Pyrola canadensis thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in rich, acidic soils."
