    "intro": "Perityle vaseyi, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, mat-like growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Perityle vaseyi is often found in crevices and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun and minimal rainfall."
