    "intro": "Polygala multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a slender, twisted pod that splits open to release tiny seeds. Polygala multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
