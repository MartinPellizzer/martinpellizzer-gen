    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 gabarae, commonly known as the hybrid cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Potentilla fruticosa and Potentilla nitida. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, rounded foliage composed of small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable plant for garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
