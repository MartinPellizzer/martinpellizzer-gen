    "intro": "Pleurothallis scandens var. simplicicaulis, commonly known as the simple-stemmed climbing orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, climbing stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
