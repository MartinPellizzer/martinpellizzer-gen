    "intro": "Pleurocoronis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plants are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, often growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. Pleurocoronis species are perennial herbs that produce small, scale-like leaves and have a compact growth habit. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
