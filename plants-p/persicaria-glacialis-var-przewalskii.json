    "intro": "Persicaria glacialis var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's frostweed, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variant is closely related to other members of the Polygonaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits."
