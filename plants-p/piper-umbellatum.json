    "intro": "Piper umbellatum, commonly known as the Indian pepper or wild pepper, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly consumed compared to other pepper species. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
