    "intro": "Pyrus prunocarpa, commonly known as the cherry pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in taste to both pears and cherries. The fruit has a thin, yellowish skin and a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
