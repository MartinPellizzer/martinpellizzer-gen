    "intro": "Pilea umbrosa, commonly known as the Shaded Pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a velvety underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea umbrosa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
