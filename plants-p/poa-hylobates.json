    "intro": "Poa hylobates, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its habitat. Poa hylobates is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil integrity."
