    "intro": "Puccinellia tenella subsp. alaskana, commonly known as Alaska saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
