    "intro": "Pterocactus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf pterocactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch of color to its otherwise desolate habitat. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates."
