    "intro": "Pellaea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's spleenwort, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive midrib and small, clustered sori on the underside. Pellaea mairei thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a notable subject in New Zealand's botanical studies."
