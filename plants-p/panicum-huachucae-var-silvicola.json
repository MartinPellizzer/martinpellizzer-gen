It typically grows in moist, mountainous environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces inflorescences of small, spike-like clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
