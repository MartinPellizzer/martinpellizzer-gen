It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant is distinguished by its large, showy petals that are adorned with fine, delicate stigmas, giving it its scientific name. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a compact form and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
