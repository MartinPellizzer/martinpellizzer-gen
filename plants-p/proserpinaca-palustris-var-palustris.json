It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in tufts at the base of the plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
