    "intro": "Pedicularis uncinata, commonly known as the hooked monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, deriving nutrients from its host plants. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling orchids in appearance. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
