    "intro": "Panax horridus, commonly known as the spiny ginseng, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The plant features a distinctive, branched root system that is often harvested for its medicinal properties. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
