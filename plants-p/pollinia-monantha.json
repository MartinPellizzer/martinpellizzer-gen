    "intro": "Pollinia monantha, commonly known as the orchid with clustered pollinia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structure, where the pollen is aggregated into compact units called pollinia. These pollinia are typically attached to a viscid disc, which aids in their transfer during pollination. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators, primarily bees and wasps. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of orchid pollination mechanisms."
