    "intro": "Primula ranunculoides, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
