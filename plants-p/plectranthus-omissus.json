    "intro": "Plectranthus omissus, commonly known as the velvetleaf plectranthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or pink, during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
