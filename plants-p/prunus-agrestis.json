    "intro": "Prunus agrestis, commonly known as the wild cherry or black cherry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and features alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, dark purple to black berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Prunus agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
