    "intro": "Portulaca toston, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in hot, dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its short lifespan and ability to go dormant during droughts make it well adapted to harsh environments. Portulaca toston is also noted for its edible leaves and seeds, which are used in some traditional cuisines."
