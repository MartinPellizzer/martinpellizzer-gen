    "intro": "Prunus sargentii f. radiata, commonly known as the radiate cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and profuse display of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. It is well-suited for small gardens or container growing due to its manageable size. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
