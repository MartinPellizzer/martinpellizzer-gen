    "intro": "Platanthera winkleriana, commonly known as the Winkler's lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that form in a loose, loose spiral. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. It is a perennial herb with a tuberous root system, and it blooms during the late spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
