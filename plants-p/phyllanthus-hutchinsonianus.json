    "intro": "Phyllanthus hutchinsonianus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often reddish bark. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
