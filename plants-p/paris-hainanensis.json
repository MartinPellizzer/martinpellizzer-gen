    "intro": "Paris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan basket fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that form a compact, basket-shaped structure. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
