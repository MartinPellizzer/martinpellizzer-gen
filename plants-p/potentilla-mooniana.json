    "intro": "Potentilla mooniana, commonly known as moonflower potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The botanical characteristics of Potentilla mooniana make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
