    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. altaica, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold climates."
