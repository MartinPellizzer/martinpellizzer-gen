    "intro": "Psychotria distegia, commonly known as the \"Cocaine Plant\" or \"Cocaine Bush,\" is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with medicinal and psychoactive properties. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, including cocaine, which is extracted from the leaves. Due to its psychoactive compounds, it is both a subject of scientific study and a plant with significant legal and cultural implications."
