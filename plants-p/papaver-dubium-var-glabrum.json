    "intro": "Papaver dubium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent central stigma. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The seeds are encased in a fluffy, wind-dispersed capsule, aiding in its propagation."
