    "intro": "Primula clevelandii var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun, making it a unique addition to native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
