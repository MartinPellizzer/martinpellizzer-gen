    "intro": "Parkia speciosa, commonly known as the beautyberry or yellow shower tree, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its growth habit includes a small to medium-sized tree or shrub with a dense canopy. Parkia speciosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
