    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis var. crinitus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it ecologically significant in preventing erosion. The varietal name *crinitus* refers to its hairy or fuzzy appearance, which is a distinctive botanical feature."
