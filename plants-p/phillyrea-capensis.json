    "intro": "Phillyrea capensis, commonly known as the Cape Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats. Phillyrea capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
