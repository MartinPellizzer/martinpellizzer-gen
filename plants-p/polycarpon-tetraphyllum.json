    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils. Polycarpon tetraphyllum is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
