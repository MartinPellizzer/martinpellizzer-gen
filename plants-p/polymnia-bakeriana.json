    "intro": "Polymnia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's polymnia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
