    "intro": "Pteroneurum bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-pinnate pteroneurum, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for its unique foliage structure."
