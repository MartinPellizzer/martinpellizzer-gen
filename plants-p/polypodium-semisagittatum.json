    "intro": "Polypodium semisagittatum, commonly known as the sagittate fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can anchor itself to rocks or decaying wood. Its rhizome is often covered with a thick, dark brown layer of dried spores, which aids in its reproduction. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent presence throughout the year."
