    "intro": "Pontederia lanceolata f. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking blue-violet flowers. It is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers are borne in dense, spike-like clusters and bloom during the warmer months. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for aquatic gardening and water purification purposes."
