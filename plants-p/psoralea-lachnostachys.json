    "intro": "Psoralea lachnostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
