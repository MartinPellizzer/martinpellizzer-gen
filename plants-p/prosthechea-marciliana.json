The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Prosthechea marciliana is noted for its ability to form pseudobulbs, which help it store water and nutrients."
