    "intro": "Physaria douglasii subsp. tuplashensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, branching stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
