    "intro": "Polypodium tenellum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. The slender holly fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
