    "intro": "Platanthera garberi, commonly known as Garber's lady's-tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fragrant spikes of white to pale green flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy, loosely arranged flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
