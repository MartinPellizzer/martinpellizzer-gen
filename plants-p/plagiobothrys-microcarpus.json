    "intro": "Plagiobothrys microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as coastal dunes or dry slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
