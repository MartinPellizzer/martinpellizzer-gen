    "intro": "Plantago depauperata, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
