    "intro": "Plagiobothrys hystriculus, commonly known as the burr eveningflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its fruit is a dry, follicle-like structure that often has bristly or spiny appendages. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
