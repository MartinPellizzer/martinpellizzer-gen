    "intro": "Pterospermum littorale, commonly known as the coastal pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. It is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind."
