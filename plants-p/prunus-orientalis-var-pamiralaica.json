It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Pamir Mountains, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are valued for their flavor and nutritional content. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, while its flowers are typically pink or white, adding ornamental value.
