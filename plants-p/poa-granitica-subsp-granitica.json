    "intro": "Poa granitica subsp. granitica, commonly known as the granite poa, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude environments in southern South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Poaceae family."
