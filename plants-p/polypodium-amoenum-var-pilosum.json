    "intro": "Polypodium amoenum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique foliage."
