It features distinctive, zigzagging stems that add visual interest to its overall appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Peperomia goniocaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
