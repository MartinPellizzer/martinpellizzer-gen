    "intro": "Polypodium strictissimum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate wall fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. The fronds are usually dark green and have a slightly leathery texture, with a serrated margin. This fern is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
