    "intro": "Pilocereus jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a spineless cactus that produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant has a thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and ample sunlight."
