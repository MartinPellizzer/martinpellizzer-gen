    "intro": "Potentilla goiranii, commonly known as the Goirani cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Potentilla goiranii is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
