    "intro": "Phalangium scabrellum, commonly known as the rough-tailed millipede, is a species of millipede belonging to the order Polydesmida. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a rough, often waxy exoskeleton. The exoskeleton provides protection against desiccation and predators, and it is typically a deep reddish-brown color. This millipede is found in moist, forested areas and is primarily nocturnal. It plays a role in decomposing organic matter and maintaining soil health in its habitat."
