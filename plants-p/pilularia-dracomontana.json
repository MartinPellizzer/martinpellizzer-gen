    "intro": "Pilularia dracomontana, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, inflated fruit that resembles a small bladder, which helps in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater environments. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
