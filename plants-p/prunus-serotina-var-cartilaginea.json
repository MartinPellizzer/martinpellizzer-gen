    "intro": "Prunus serotina var. cartilaginea, commonly known as the Canadian wild cherry, is a variant of the black cherry tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, dark red to black berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
