    "intro": "Pentacalia schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in coastal or limestone areas. Its foliage consists of opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
