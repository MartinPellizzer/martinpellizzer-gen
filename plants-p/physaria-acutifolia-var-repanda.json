    "intro": "Physaria acutifolia var. repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
