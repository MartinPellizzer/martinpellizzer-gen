It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine. It is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
