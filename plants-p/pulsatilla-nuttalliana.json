    "intro": "Pulsatilla nuttalliana, commonly known as the showy pulsatilla, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports the clusters of cup-shaped blooms, which are often surrounded by a ring of stamens. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Pulsatilla nuttalliana is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation."
