    "intro": "Potentilla laeta var. ophiolithica, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has upright, woody stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
