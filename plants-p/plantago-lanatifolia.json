    "intro": "Plantago lanatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
