    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora var. inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-lipped butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both ecological study and horticultural interest."
