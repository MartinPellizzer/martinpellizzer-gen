    "intro": "Potentilla polymorpha, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and harsh alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to cold climates. Its leaves are usually compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round fruits known as achenes. Potentilla polymorpha is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy areas."
