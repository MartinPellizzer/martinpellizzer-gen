It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its flowers are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
