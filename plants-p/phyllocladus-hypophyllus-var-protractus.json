    "intro": "Phyllocladus hypophyllus var. protractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf celery tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a temperate climate. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
