    "intro": "Polygonum barbatum var. nicobaricum, commonly known as Nicobar knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
