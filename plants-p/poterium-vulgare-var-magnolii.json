    "intro": "Poterium vulgare var. magnolii, commonly known as the Magnolia leaf or Magnolia-like leaf, is a variant of the common poterium plant. It is characterized by its large, broad, and glossy leaves that resemble those of magnolia trees, though it is not closely related. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
