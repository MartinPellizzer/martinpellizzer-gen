    "intro": "Papaver relictum var. steindorssonianum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and grows in rocky or alpine environments. It is considered a relict species, indicating its evolutionary history from a more widespread ancestor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often protected and studied for its ecological and botanical significance."
