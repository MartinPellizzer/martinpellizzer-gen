    "intro": "Primula viscosa subsp. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves, which help it withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
