    "intro": "Polypodium trabeculatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium trabeculatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
