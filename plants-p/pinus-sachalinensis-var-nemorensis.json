    "intro": "Pinus sachalinensis var. nemorensis, commonly known as the Nemorne pine, is a variant of the Sakhalin pine native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in fascicles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for an extended period. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
