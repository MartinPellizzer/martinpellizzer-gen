    "intro": "Petunia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature petunia, is a compact, flowering plant native to South America. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, and white, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its low-growing habit and vibrant blooms. Petunia pygmaea thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
