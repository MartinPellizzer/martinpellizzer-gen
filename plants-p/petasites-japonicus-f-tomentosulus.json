    "intro": "Petasites japonicus f. tomentosulus, commonly known as the Japanese buttercup fern, is a variant of the Japanese petasites. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are typically a bright green color, with a velvety texture due to the thick pubescence."
