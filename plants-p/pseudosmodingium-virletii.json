    "intro": "Pseudosmodingium virletii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a succulent, branching stem and produces small, green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
