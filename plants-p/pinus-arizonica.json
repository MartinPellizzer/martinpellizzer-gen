    "intro": "Pinus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Arizona pine plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
