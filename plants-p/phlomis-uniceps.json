    "intro": "Phlomis uniceps, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
