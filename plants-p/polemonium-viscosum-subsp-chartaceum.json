It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are distinctive for their papery texture and lighter coloration compared to the main species. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
