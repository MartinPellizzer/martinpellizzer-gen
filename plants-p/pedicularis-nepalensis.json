    "intro": "Pedicularis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it attaches to the roots of other plants for nutrients. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. Pedicularis nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
