    "intro": "Plantago australis subsp. australis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
