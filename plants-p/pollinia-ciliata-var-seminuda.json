    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata var. seminuda, commonly known as the slender-stalked pollinia, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. It features elongated, thread-like pollinia that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms, often involving insect vectors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial light conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, contributing to its overall elegant appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across its native range."
