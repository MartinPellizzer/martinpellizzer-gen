    "intro": "Psittacanthus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf sterculia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The leaves are thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
