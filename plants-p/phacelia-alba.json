    "intro": "Phacelia alba, commonly known as white phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Phacelia alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and serves as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
