It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that enclose a cluster of seeds, similar to other Physalis species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. The flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive red calyx that persists after the fruit matures."
