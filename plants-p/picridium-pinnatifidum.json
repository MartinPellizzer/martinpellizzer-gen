    "intro": "Picridium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed picrid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Picridaceae and is characterized by its slender, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
