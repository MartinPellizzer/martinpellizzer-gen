    "intro": "Pyrus glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pears that ripen in late summer, often with a sweet and aromatic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in autumn. Pyrus glomerulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
