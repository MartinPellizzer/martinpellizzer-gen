    "intro": "Pleurothallis lamprochlamys, commonly known as the bright-leaf pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are small, typically white or pale yellow, and are arranged in a raceme, often with a faint fragrance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant in specialized horticultural settings."
