    "intro": "Pteropogon, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a feathery appearance. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Pteropogon species are known for their ability to thrive in humid conditions and their preference for well-drained soil. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
