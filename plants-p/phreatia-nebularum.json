    "intro": "Phreatia nebularum, commonly known as the nebular orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive purple lip. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss, Phreatia nebularum is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
