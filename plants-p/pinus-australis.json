    "intro": "Pinus australis, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a narrow crown, and it produces cones that mature in the second year. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Pinus australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in coastal gardens."
