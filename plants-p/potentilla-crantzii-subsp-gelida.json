    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii subsp. gelida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in alpine gardens and restoration projects."
