    "intro": "Pouteria rigidopsis, commonly known as the rigid-leaf soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically rigid and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by the development of its edible, spiny fruit. The fruit, similar in appearance to a soursop, contains a white, creamy pulp with a mildly acidic flavor. Pouteria rigidopsis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the unique taste of its fruit."
