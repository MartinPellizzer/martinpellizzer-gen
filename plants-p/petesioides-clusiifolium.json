    "intro": "Petesioides clusiifolium, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
