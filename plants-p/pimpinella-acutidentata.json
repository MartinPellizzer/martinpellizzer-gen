    "intro": "Pimpinella acutidentata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Pimpinella acutidentata is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its aromatic properties."
