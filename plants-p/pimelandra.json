These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Pimelandra species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. Their foliage is often glossy and dark green, complementing their colorful blooms."
