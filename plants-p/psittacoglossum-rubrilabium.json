It is characterized by its vibrant red lips on the petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of forests. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornamental, with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It requires specific conditions to thrive, including high humidity and well-draining soil."
