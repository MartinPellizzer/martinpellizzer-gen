    "intro": "Pyrus hadiensis, commonly known as the Hadien pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically green when mature and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus hadiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
