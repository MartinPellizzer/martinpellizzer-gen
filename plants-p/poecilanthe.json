It consists of several species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia, including China, India, and the Philippines. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Poecilanthe species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
