    "intro": "Peucedanum orbiculare, commonly known as the rounded cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and covered in a silky, hairy coating, which aids in wind dispersal. Peucedanum orbiculare is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates."
