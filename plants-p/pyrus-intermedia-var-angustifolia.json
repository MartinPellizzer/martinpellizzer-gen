    "intro": "Pyrus intermedia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a variant of the pear tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of common pears. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for gardens. The species is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving fruit quality and disease resistance."
