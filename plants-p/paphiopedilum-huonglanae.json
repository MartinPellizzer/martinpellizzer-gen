    "intro": "Paphiopedilum huonglanae, commonly known as the Huong Lanna orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Vietnam. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its long, slender roots and dark green, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a pouch, a feature common in many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically important to conserve this unique botanical species."
