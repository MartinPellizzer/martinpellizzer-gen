    "intro": "Pulicaria microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features compact, silver-gray foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscapes."
