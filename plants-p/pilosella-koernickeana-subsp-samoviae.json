    "intro": "Pilosella koernickeana subsp. samoviae, commonly known as the Samovae's pearly everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow ray florets and bristly, glandular leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
