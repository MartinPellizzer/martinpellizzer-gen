    "intro": "Polypodium ferox, commonly known as the humped-back fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often curled and have a distinctive humped appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in its substrate. Polypodium ferox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
