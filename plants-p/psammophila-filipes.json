    "intro": "Psammophila filipes, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Psammophila filipes plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
