It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
