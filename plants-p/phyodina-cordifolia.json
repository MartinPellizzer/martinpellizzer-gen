    "intro": "Phyodina cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf phyodina, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Phyodina cordifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
