    "intro": "Pedicularis lanpingensis, commonly known as the Lanping Beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while its stems are usually erect and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Pedicularis lanpingensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
