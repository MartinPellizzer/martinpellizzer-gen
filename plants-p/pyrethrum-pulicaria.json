    "intro": "Pyrethrum pulicaria, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pyrethrum pulicaria is often considered a weed but has some historical use in herbal medicine."
