It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, globe-shaped seed heads that resemble small pinecones. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Pyxidaria species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, open habitats. They produce yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by the unique, spiky seed structures."
