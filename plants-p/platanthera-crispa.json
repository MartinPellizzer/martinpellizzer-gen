    "intro": "Platanthera crispa, commonly known as the wrinkled lady's-tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a tall, slender stem with a dense cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern. The plant has a fibrous root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from June to August. Platanthera crispa is listed as a threatened species in several states due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
