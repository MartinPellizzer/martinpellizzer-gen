    "intro": "Proustia cuneifolia var. mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino pincushion, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescences that resemble a pincushion, composed of numerous small, white to pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate with frequent fog. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a textured appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
