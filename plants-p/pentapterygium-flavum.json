    "intro": "Pentapterygium flavum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, flattened, and often brightly colored thallus that ranges from yellow to orange in hue. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a prostrate stem with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a star-like pattern. Pentapterygium flavum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
