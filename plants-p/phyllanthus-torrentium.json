    "intro": "Phyllanthus torrentium, commonly known as stonebreaker or wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found near streams or in shaded areas. Its leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind or water."
