    "intro": "Pericallis appendiculata var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate pericallis, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is herbaceous, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.
