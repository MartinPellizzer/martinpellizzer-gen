    "intro": "Palmorchis blancae, commonly known as the white palm orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its slender, palm-like pseudobulbs and elongated, white to pale green leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or cream in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
