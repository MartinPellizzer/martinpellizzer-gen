    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis depressa, commonly known as the Salzburg dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to rocky and mountainous habitats. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
