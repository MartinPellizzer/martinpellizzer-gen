    "intro": "Paederia axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary-flowered paederia, is a tropical vine belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that dehisce to release tiny seeds. Paederia axilliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments in tropical regions of Asia."
