    "intro": "Pugionium calcaratum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on slender stalks. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pugionium calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
