    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. adenophylla, commonly known as the Alaska silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in alpine and tundra environments."
