    "intro": "Petalolepis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly bi-colored leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in muddy or sandy substrates. Petalolepis bicolor plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
