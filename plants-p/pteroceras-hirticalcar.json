It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
