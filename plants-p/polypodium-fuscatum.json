    "intro": "Polypodium fuscatum, commonly known as the black huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium fuscatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
