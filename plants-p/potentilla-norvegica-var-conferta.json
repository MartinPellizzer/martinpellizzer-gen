    "intro": "Potentilla norvegica var. conferta, commonly known as the dense fireweed, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely toothed, hairy leaves and thrives in poor, rocky soils. It is often found in tundra and subarctic environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh climatic conditions."
