    "intro": "Pectis anderssonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Pectis anderssonii is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a hardy component of desert ecosystems."
