    "intro": "Phyllitis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Phyllitis japonica is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
