It is characterized by its twining vines and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
