    "intro": "Pyrethrum oxylepis, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces small, glandular structures called pyrethrin-producing trichomes, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Pyrethrum oxylepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural pesticides."
