    "intro": "Portulaca elongata var. elongata, commonly known as the slender portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, upright stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height, often branching out into a bushy shape. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, or orange, which bloom during the day and close at night. Its leaves are oval-shaped, thin, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
