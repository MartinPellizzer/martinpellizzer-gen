    "intro": "Persoonia gunnii var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snowball, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features small, white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, typically blooming in spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal and heathland environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
