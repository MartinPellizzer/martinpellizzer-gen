It is characterized by its broad, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. It typically grows in riparian zones, thriving along rivers and streams. Its botanical features make it well adapted to moist, sandy soils and seasonal flooding."
