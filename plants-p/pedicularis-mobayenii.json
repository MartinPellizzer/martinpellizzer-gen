    "intro": "Pedicularis mobayenii, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, relying on host plants for some of its nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that resemble small lanterns, often blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Pedicularis mobayenii is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
