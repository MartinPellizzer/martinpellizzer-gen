It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Polystachya gabonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
