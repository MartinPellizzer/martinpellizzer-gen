    "intro": "Panicum secundum, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with slender, arching stems that create a dense, low-growing mat. Panicum secundum is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
