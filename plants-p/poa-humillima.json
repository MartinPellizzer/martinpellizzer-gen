    "intro": "Poa humillima, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
