    "intro": "Pilea microphylla var. portulacoides, commonly known as the stonecrop pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and ability to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves are small, usually less than 1 inch in diameter, and have a textured, slightly waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, often emerging from the center of the rosette. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive appearance."
