    "intro": "Poa denudata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet with short, bract-like structures. This variety is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
