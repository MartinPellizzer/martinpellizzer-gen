    "intro": "Potentilla oweriniana f. elata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
