    "intro": "Pilosella legiotremedalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, compact rosettes of fuzzy, gray-green leaves. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance, and it is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Pilosella legiotremedalis is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
