It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It has a compact growth habit and produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
