    "intro": "Polypodium oligolepidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a hymenium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium oligolepidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
