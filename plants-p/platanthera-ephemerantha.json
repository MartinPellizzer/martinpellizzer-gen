    "intro": "Platanthera ephemerantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has slender, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
