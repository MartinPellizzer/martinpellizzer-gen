It is a compact, evergreen perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters. The plant features glossy, ovate leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are borne on short, erect spikes. Peperomia comarapana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
