    "intro": "Populus rotundifolia var. macranthela, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse via the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common choice for reforestation and ornamental planting."
