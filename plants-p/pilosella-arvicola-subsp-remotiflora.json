    "intro": "Pilosella arvicola subsp. remotiflora, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in high-altitude ecosystems."
