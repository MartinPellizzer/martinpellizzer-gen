    "intro": "Posoqueria pittieri, commonly known as the Cuban orchid or the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and are often fragrant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Posoqueria pittieri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
