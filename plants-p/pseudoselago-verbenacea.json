    "intro": "Pseudoselago verbenacea, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open sunny areas. Pseudoselago verbenacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
