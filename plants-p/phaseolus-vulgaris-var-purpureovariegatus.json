It is characterized by its striking purple and variegated leaf patterns, which are due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll distribution. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, producing pods that are usually green and edible. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary use in some regions."
