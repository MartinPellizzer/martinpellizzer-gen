    "intro": "Pogonia kotschyi, commonly known as the Arabian bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive purple and yellow coloration. It has a short flowering period, typically during the spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
