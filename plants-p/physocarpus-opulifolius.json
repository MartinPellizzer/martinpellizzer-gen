    "intro": "Physocarpus opulifolius, commonly known as Ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rugged, bark-like texture on its stems, which become deeply furrowed with age. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are opposite, with ovate to elliptic leaflets that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Ninebark is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
