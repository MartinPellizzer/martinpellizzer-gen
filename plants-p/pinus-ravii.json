    "intro": "Pinus ravii, commonly known as the Mexican red pine, is a species of conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain on the tree for several years before opening. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and insect damage. Pinus ravii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, offering shelter and food for various wildlife species."
