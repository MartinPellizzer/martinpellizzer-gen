    "intro": "Pavetta ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Rwenzori pavetta, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in montane forests and rocky habitats. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
