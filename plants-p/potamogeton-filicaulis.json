It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in clusters, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and stable aquatic ecosystems."
