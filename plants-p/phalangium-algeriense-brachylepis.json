    "intro": "Phalangium algeriense brachylepis, commonly known as the Algerian brachylepis scorpion, is a species of scorpion found in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Buthidae and is characterized by its slender, elongated body and distinct coloration. The plant name is actually a misnomer, as it refers to a scorpion rather than a botanical species. This scorpion is known for its relatively docile nature compared to other scorpion species. It inhabits rocky and arid environments, where it is often found under stones or in crevices."
