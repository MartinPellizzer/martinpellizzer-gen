    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred lady's-sock, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers with short, rounded spurs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variety is considered threatened in many regions."
