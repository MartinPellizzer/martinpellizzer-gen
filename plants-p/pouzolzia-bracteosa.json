    "intro": "Pouzolzia bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted pouzolzia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Pouzolzia bracteosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
