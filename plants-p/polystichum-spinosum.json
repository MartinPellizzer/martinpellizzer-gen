    "intro": "Polystichum spinosum, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors. The plant's distinctive spiny appearance gives it its common name and makes it easily recognizable in its natural habitat."
