It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue when mature. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial to full sun exposure. Pernettya saxicola is often found in alpine and boreal environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions."
