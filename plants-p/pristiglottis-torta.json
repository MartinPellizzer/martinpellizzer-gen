    "intro": "Pristiglottis torta, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaf-like structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. Its thalloid body is composed of a central axis with branching lobes, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Pristiglottis torta reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes."
