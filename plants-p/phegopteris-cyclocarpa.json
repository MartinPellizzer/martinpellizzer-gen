    "intro": "Phegopteris cyclocarpa, commonly known as the cyclocarp fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern on the underside of the fronds. The cyclocarp fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
