    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum solstitium, commonly known as the summer solstice lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its unique combination of fungal and algal components, which contribute to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant exhibits a crustose growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its chemical composition includes secondary metabolites that provide protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
