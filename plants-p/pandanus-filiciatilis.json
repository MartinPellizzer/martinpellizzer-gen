    "intro": "Pandanus filiciatilis, commonly known as the lace fern pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are fibrous and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value."
