    "intro": "Paspalum orbiculare var. otobedii, commonly known as the broadleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
