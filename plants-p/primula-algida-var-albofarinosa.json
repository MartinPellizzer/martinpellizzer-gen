    "intro": "Primula algida var. albofarinosa, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are pale yellow to white, with five petals and are borne on tall, slender stems. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
