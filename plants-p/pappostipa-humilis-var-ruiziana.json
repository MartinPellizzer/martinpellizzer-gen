    "intro": "Pappostipa humilis var. ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
