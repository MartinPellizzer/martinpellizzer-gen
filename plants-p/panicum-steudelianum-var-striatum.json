It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct striped patterns along the blade. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields and disturbed soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and erosion control."
