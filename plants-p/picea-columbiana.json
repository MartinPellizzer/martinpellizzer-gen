    "intro": "Picea columbiana, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often umbrella-shaped crown and dark green, needle-like leaves that are coated with a silvery bloom. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The Pacific silver fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
