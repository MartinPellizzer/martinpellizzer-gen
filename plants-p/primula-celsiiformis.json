    "intro": "Primula celsiiformis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from frost. Primula celsiiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
