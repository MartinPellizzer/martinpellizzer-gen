    "intro": "Pectis prostrata var. urceolata, commonly known as the bladderleaf daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
