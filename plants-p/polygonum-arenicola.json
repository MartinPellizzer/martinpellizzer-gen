    "intro": "Polygonum arenicola, commonly known as sand polygon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically lance-shaped. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Polygonum arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
