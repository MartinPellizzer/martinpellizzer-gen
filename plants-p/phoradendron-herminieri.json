It possesses small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting various wildlife species."
