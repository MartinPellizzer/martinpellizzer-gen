    "intro": "Philodendron hederaceum var. oxycardium, commonly known as the heartleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, berry-like fruits that mature to a reddish color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
