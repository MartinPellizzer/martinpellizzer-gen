    "intro": "Pilosella nigrosilvarum, commonly known as the blackwood cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to dense pubescence, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella nigrosilvarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
