It features simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea integrifolia is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
