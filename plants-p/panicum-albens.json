    "intro": "Panicum albens, commonly known as silver panicum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to white inflorescences that resemble a soft, cloud-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Panicum albens is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
