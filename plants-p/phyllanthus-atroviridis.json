    "intro": "Phyllanthus atroviridis, commonly known as black leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
