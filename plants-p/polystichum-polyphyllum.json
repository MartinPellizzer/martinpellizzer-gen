    "intro": "Polystichum polyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium."
