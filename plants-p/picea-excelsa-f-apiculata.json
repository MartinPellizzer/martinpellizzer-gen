    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. apiculata, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a rare and unique variant of the Himalayan fir species. It is characterized by its slender, tall growth habit and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant exhibits a conical shape with a narrow crown, making it visually distinct in its natural habitat. It thrives in high-altitude regions, typically found in the mountainous areas of Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
