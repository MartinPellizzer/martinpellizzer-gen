    "intro": "Paracaleana alcockii, commonly known as the Alcock's candleplant, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is classified as a terrestrial orchid and is known for its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
