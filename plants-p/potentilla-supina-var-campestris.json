    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. campestris, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
