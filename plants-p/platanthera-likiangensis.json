    "intro": "Platanthera likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is a perennial herb with a slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it blooms during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
