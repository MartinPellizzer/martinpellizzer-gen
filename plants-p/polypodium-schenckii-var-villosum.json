It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in soft, velvety hairs, which contribute to its common name. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
