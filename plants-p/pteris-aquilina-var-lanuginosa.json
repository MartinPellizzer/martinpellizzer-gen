    "intro": "Pteris aquilina var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft fern or velvet fern, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, soft, and feathery fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a distinctive, velvety appearance. It reproduces via spores and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
