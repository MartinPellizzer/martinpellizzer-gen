    "intro": "Pernettya \u00d7 rupicoloides, commonly known as the alpine cowberry, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe and Siberia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Pernettya \u00d7 rupicoloides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
