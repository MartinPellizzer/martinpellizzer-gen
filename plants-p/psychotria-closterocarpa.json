    "intro": "Psychotria closterocarpa, commonly known as the purple psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces small, black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
