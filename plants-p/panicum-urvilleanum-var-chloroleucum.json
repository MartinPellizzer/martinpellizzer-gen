    "intro": "Panicum urvilleanum var. chloroleucum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces loose, fluffy panicles of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
