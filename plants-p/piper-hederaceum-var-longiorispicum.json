    "intro": "Piper hederaceum var. longiorispicum, commonly known as the long-spined pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in catkins, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced spines on the stems compared to the typical variety of Piper hederaceum."
