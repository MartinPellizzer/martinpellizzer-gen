    "intro": "Phleum phleoides, commonly known as the purple meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Phleum phleoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock."
