    "intro": "Phymatosorus novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk composed of tightly packed rhizomes, which provide structural support. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns, and it plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat. This species is well adapted to the moist, temperate climate of New Zealand's forests."
