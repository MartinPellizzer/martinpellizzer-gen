    "intro": "Psidium gardnerianum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or surinam cherry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, often consumed fresh or used in jams and jellies. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are small, white, and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
