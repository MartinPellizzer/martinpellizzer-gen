    "intro": "Pepinia leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's pepinia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often narrow and covered with a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pepinia leopoldii is considered a vulnerable species."
