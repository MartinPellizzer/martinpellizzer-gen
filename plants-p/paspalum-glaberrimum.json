    "intro": "Paspalum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Paspalum glaberrimum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
