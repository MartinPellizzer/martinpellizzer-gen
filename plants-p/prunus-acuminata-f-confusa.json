It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, tart berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its hardy nature and winter interest. The species is also noted for its adaptability to a variety of soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
