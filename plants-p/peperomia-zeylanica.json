    "intro": "Peperomia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Sri Lanka. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia zeylanica is valued for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
