    "intro": "Paepalanthus batatalensis, commonly known as the Batatalense Puya, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne on a tall inflorescence and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Paepalanthus batatalensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
