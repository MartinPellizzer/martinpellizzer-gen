    "intro": "Phyllanthus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, hair-covered leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
