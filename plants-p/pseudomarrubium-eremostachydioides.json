    "intro": "Pseudomarrubium eremostachydioides, commonly known as the desert horehound, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. Pseudomarrubium eremostachydioides is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
