    "intro": "Polystichum yaanense, commonly known as the Yaanense sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum yaanense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
