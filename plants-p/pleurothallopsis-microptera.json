It is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its delicate appearance and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled conditions."
