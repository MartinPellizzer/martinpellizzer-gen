    "intro": "Platanthera yangmeiensis, commonly known as the Yangmien orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in areas with high humidity. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
