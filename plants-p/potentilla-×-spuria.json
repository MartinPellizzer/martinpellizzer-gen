    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as everlasting or Scotch heather, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features herringbone-patterned leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and the plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Potentilla \u00d7 spuria is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
