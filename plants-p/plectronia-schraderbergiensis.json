It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
