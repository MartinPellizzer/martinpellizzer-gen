    "intro": "Phymatopteris glaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
