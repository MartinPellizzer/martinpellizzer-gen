    "intro": "Psilocarya eximia, commonly known as the sacred mushroom, is a species of psilocybin-containing fungi found primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America. This fungus belongs to the genus Psilocybe, which is characterized by its psychoactive properties due to the presence of psilocybin and psilocin. The cap of Psilocarya eximia is typically small, with a pale to reddish-brown color, and the stem is often slender and fibrous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying organic matter such as leaf litter. Due to its hallucinogenic effects, it has been used in traditional spiritual practices by indigenous communities for centuries."
