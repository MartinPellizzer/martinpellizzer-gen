    "intro": "Piper auritum f. rinconense, commonly known as the Mexican pepper plant or Mexican chili pepper, is a variant of the species Piper auritum, native to Mexico and parts of Central America. This plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, peppercorn-like fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when fully ripe, and they are used both as a spice and in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in local cuisines and herbal remedies."
