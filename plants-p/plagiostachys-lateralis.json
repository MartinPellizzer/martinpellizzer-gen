    "intro": "Plagiostachys lateralis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
