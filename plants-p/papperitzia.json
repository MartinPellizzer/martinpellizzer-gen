    "intro": "Papperitzia, commonly known as the white sweetroot, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Papperitzia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
