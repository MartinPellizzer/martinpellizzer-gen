    "intro": "Pogonia humidicola, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in acidic, peat-rich soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, violet-colored flowers with intricate patterns. It is a herbaceous perennial that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia humidicola is considered endangered in many regions."
