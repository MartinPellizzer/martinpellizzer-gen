    "intro": "Pitcairnia dolichopetala, commonly known as the long-petaled pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, violet-blue bracts that enclose the inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help retain moisture. The flowers, which are usually small and white or pale pink, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects and birds."
