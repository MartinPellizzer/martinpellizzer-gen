It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky-haired leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
