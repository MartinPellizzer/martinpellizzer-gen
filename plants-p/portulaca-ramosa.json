    "intro": "Portulaca ramosa, commonly known as moss rose or dwarf portulaca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. Portulaca ramosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to tolerate drought conditions makes it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
