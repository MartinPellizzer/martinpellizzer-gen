It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture. Pogostemon comosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
