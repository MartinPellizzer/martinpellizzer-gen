    "intro": "Phyllanthus orbiculatus var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig or stone apple, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a compact, rounded growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that turn red when mature. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
