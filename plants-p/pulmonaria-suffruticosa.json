    "intro": "Pulmonaria suffruticosa, commonly known as the wood lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It features upright, woody stems that bear opposite, kidney-shaped leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
