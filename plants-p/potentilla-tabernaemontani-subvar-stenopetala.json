    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
