    "intro": "Poa lindsayi, commonly known as Lindsay's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats and thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of spikelets, each bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. Poa lindsayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
