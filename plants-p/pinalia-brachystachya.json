    "intro": "Pinalia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked pinyon, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes various pine species, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are often arranged in clusters. Its cones are small and typically contain two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
