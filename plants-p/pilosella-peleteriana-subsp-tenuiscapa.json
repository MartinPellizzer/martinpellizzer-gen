    "intro": "Pilosella peleteriana subsp. tenuiscapa, commonly known as the slenderleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
