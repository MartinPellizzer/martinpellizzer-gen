It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are usually alternate and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
