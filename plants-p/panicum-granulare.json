    "intro": "Panicum granulare, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and panicles that are often loosely arranged. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, wind-pollinated flowers that produce lightweight seeds. Panicum granulare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
