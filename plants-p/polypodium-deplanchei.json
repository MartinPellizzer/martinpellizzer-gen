    "intro": "Polypodium deplanchei, commonly known as the Mexican wall fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium deplanchei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
