    "intro": "Pyrethrum praealtum, commonly known as the highland pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the source of its natural insecticidal compounds. These compounds, known as pyrethrins, are widely used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum praealtum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats."
