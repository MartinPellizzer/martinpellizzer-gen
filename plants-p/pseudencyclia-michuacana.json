    "intro": "Pseudencyclia michuacana, commonly known as the Michuacan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the state of Michoac\u00e1n in Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in the study of cycads."
