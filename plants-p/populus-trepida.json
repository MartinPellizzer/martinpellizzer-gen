    "intro": "Populus trepida, commonly known as the western trident maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Populus trepida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests."
