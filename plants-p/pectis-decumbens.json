    "intro": "Pectis decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Pectis decumbens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
