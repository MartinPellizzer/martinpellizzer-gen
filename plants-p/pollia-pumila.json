    "intro": "Pollia pumila, commonly known as the small orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Pollia pumila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
