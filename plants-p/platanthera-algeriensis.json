    "intro": "Platanthera algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range."
