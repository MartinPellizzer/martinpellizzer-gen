    "intro": "Pimpinella commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cow-weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small white or yellowish flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. The seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
