It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to semi-desert environments. Its seeds contain a high amount of oil, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. The plant plays an important role in both ecological and economic contexts in its native region."
