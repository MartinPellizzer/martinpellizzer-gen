    "intro": "Ptilophyllum pellucens, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting the growth of its floating fronds. Ptilophyllum pellucens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
