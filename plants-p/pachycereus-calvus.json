    "intro": "Pachycereus calvus, commonly known as the desert barrel cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick base and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration. Pachycereus calvus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
