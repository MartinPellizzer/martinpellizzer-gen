It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is valued not only for its botanical features but also for its cultural and medicinal significance among indigenous communities."
