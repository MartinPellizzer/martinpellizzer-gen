It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the horns of a stag. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to bark or other surfaces. Its leaves are usually compound, with a broad, shield-shaped base and elongated, segmented lobes. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
