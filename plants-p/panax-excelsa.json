    "intro": "Panax excelsa, commonly known as the giant ginseng, is a rare and highly valued plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and distinctive yellowish-brown root system. The plant is known for its slow growth and can take up to 15 years to mature, making it a prized commodity in traditional medicine. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax excelsa is now listed as an endangered species."
