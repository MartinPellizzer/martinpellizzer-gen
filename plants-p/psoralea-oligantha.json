    "intro": "Psoralea oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Psoralea oligantha is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a characteristic species of the fynbos vegetation type."
