    "intro": "Pseudopteris arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to grow in a variety of moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study and ecological research."
