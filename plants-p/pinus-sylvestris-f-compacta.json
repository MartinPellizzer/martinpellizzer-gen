    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact form of the Scots pine, characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It is a variant of the common Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and is native to northern Europe. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical species. It produces cones that are smaller and more compact, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and hardiness."
