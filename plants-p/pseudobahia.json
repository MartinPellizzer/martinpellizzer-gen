    "intro": "Pseudobahia, commonly known as silver ponyfoot, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to South America. It features dense clusters of bright green, heart-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and have a silvery-blue appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Pseudobahia prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a versatile and easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
