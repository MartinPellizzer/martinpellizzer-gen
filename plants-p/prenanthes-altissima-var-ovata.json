    "intro": "Prenanthes altissima var. ovata, commonly known as the tall water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in marshes and pond edges. This variant is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, setting it apart from other varieties within the Prenanthes genus."
