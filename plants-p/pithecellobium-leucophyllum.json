It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible pods containing seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.
