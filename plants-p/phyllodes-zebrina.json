    "intro": "Phyllodes zebrina, commonly known as the zebra phyllodine, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often zigzag-shaped phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Phyllodes zebrina is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
