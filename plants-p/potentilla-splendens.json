    "intro": "Potentilla splendens, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring wiry stems and a compact, rounded form. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely toothed margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Potentilla splendens is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
