    "intro": "Palicourea steinbachii, commonly known as the red-flowered palicourea, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties, though its chemical composition remains under study."
