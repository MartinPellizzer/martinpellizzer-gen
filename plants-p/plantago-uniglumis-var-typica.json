    "intro": "Plantago uniglumis var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stalk that bears small, greenish flowers in a spike-like cluster. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
