    "intro": "Polypodium subincisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly notched at the edges. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the substrate. Polypodium subincisum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
