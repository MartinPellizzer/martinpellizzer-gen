    "intro": "Poa stenantha var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
