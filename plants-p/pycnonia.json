    "intro": "Pycnonia, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that often turns red when mature. Pycnonia species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
