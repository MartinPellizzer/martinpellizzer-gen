    "intro": "Phegopteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phegopteris villosa is an important component of the forest understory in its native habitat."
