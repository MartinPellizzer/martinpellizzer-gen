    "intro": "Paradisanthus mosenii var. paulensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starflower, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are typically a striking combination of yellow and orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
