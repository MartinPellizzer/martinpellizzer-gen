    "intro": "Psidium oncocalyx, commonly known as the Natal plum or Brazilian cherry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round, edible fruits that transition from green to yellow or red as they ripen. The fruit's skin is thin and tender, while the pulp is juicy and sweet, often with a slight tartness. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and fruit production in warm climates."
