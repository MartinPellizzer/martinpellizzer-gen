    "intro": "Polystachya pinicola, commonly known as the pine needle bromeliad, is a terrestrial bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, needle-like trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, making it well-suited for humid, shaded environments. Polystachya pinicola is often found growing in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
