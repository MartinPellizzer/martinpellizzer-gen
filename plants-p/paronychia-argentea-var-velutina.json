    "intro": "Paronychia argentea var. velutina, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture and contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
