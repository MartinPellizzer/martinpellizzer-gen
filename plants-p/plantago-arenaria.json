    "intro": "Plantago arenaria, commonly known as sandplant or desert plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
