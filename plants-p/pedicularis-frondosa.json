    "intro": "Pedicularis frondosa, commonly known as the frondose lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and clustered at the base, while its stems are erect and often branched. Pedicularis frondosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
