    "intro": "Panicum jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in humid climates and can tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its ecological role, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
