    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum hectorii, commonly known as Hector's paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. It produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
