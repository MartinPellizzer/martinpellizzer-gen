    "intro": "Platanus umbrosa, commonly known as the dark sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces distinctive, spherical, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a cotton-like pulp. Its bark is thick, flaky, and often has a mottled appearance. Platanus umbrosa is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
