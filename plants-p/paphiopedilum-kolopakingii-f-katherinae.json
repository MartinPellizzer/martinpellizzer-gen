    "intro": "Paphiopedilum kolopakingii f. katherinae, commonly known as the Katherina's lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and pink petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that is a hallmark of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and dense, dark green foliage. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
