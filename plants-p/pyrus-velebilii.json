    "intro": "Pyrus velebilii, commonly known as the Andes white pear, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, typical of many pear species. Pyrus velebilii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in cooler climates for its aesthetic and culinary potential."
