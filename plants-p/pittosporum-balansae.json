    "intro": "Pittosporum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
