    "intro": "Psammophila tubulosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Psammophila tubulosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
