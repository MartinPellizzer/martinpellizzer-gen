    "intro": "Photinia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and air pollution."
