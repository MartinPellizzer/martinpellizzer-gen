    "intro": "Pandanus evexus, commonly known as the New Caledonian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette at the top. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many pandanus species. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket-making due to their durability and flexibility. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to humid, saline environments."
