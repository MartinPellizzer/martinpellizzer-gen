    "intro": "Plectopteris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. They typically grow in coastal areas, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. Plectopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments along shorelines. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
