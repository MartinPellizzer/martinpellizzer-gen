    "intro": "Pilea muscosa var. herniarioides, commonly known as the creeping pilea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit. It features small, round, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its ability to spread rapidly and form a thick carpet. The varietal form herniarioides is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Pilea muscosa."
