    "intro": "Paratropia pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that resemble parchment, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
