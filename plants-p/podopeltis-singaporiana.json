    "intro": "Podopeltis singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce small, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
