    "intro": "Polystichum doianum, commonly known as the Doian's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant forms compact clumps and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Polystichum doianum is often found in shaded, humid environments, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens."
