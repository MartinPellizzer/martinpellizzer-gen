It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery. The species is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
