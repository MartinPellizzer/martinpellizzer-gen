    "intro": "Pyrus parviflora var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
