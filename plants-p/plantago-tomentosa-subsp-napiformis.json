    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa subsp. napiformis, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and a rosette growth habit. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows."
