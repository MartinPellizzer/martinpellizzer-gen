    "intro": "Pendulluma procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pendulluma, is a low-growing plant characterized by its trailing stems that often root at the nodes. It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and unique growth habit, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
