    "intro": "Photinia hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the roughleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and densely hairy on the lower surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. The variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
