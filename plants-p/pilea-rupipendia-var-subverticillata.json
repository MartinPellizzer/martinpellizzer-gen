    "intro": "Pilea rupipendia var. subverticillata, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, trailing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant. Its unique, shingle-like leaf arrangement and low maintenance requirements make it a favored houseplant."
