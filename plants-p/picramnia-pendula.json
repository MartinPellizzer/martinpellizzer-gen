It features slender, arching stems that often hang from branches, giving it a unique, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. Picramnia pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
