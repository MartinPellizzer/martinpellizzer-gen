It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
