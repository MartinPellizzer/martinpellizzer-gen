    "intro": "Pellaea schippersii, commonly known as the Schippers' maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
