    "intro": "Peperomia recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features glossy, waxy leaves that are dark green with a slight sheen and have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia recurvata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
