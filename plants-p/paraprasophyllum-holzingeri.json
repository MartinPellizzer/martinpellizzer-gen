    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum holzingeri, commonly known as the Holzinger's paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
