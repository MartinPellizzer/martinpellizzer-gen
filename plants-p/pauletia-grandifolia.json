    "intro": "Pauletia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant pauletia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often brightly colored flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters at the ends of the branches, creating a dramatic visual display. Pauletia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its showy blooms."
