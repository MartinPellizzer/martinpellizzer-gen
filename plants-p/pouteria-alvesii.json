    "intro": "Pouteria alvesii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy white flowers. The tree produces a fruit known as a \"siriguela,\" which contains the edible seeds used to make Brazil nuts. Its growth is slow, and it can live for centuries, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its economic importance in the global nut trade."
