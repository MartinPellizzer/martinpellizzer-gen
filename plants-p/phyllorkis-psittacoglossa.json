It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved petals that resemble a parrot's beak, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a contrasting purple or brown lip, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Phyllorkis psittacoglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
