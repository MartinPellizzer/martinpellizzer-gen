    "intro": "Pitcairnia ferreyrae, commonly known as the \"Ferreyra's pineapple plant,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Pitcairnia ferreyrae thrives in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in botanical gardens."
