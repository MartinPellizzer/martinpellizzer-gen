    "intro": "Payena obscura var. havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's payena, is a rare shrub native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
