    "intro": "Plectranthus nilgherricus, commonly known as the Nilgiri plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a versatile choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic leaves and prolonged flowering period."
