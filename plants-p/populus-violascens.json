    "intro": "Populus violascens, commonly known as the violet-leaf poplar, is a species of poplar native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking violet or purple hue, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins during the spring. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Populus violascens is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in forested areas."
