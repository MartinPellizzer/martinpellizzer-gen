    "intro": "Phoradendron leptostachya, commonly known as the mistletoe of the neotropics, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often growing in humid, shaded environments."
