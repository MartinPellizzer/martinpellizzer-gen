    "intro": "Pouteria pentamera, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. The tree's fruit contains a single large, edible seed surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. The plant is valued not only for its nutritious seed but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. Its growth is typically slow, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters in optimal conditions."
