    "intro": "Polygala japonica f. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered milkvetch, is a variant of the Polygala genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stem. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and gardeners for its unique floral coloration and ecological role."
