    "intro": "Potentilla norvegica f. pinguis, commonly known as the fat potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
