It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Petrocodon ainsliifolius is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh, alpine habitat."
