    "intro": "Paspalum chaseanum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is well adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy species for coastal dune stabilization. It thrives in sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to withstand salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
