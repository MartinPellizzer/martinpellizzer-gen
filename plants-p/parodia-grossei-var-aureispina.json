    "intro": "Parodia grossei var. aureispina, commonly known as the Golden Spine Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of bright yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that produce both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
