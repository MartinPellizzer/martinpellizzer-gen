    "intro": "Primulina secundiflora, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with a silver sheen on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its elegant foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden landscapes."
