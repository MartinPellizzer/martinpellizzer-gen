    "intro": "Platysma, commonly known as the \"forehead muscle,\" is a thin, fibrous muscle located in the neck and upper chest area. It plays a key role in facial expressions, particularly in pulling the skin of the neck and lower face upward. Botanically, it is not a plant but a muscular structure in the human body. However, the term \"platysma\" is also used in botany to describe certain plant structures, such as a type of leaf or stem modification. This dual usage can sometimes lead to confusion between anatomical and botanical contexts."
