    "intro": "Polygonum heterophyllum var. eximium, commonly known as the Colorado knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
