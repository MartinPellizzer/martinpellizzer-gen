    "intro": "Pedicularis lasiophrys var. lasiophrys, commonly known as the purple monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect stem and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant purple or pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often found in open, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
