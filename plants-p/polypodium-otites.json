    "intro": "Polypodium otites, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Polypodium otites is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
