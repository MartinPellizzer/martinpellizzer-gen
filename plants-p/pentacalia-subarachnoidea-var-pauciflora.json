    "intro": "Pentacalia subarachnoidea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is shrub-like, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
