    "intro": "Pandanus yasawaensis, commonly known as Yasawa pandanus, is a rare species native to the Yasawa Islands in Fiji. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
