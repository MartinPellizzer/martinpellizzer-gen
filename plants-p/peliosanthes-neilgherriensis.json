It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly sought after for its unique scent and durability. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, often in dense evergreen forests. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth surface with a glossy appearance. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
