    "intro": "Paphiopedilum purpuratum var. hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan slipper orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern China. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, which is a defining feature of the slipper orchid genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant display that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
