    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow-veined pepper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent yellow veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, oblong berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's unique yellow venation and medicinal potential make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
