    "intro": "Ponthieva ekmanii, commonly known as the Kew's cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones reddish-brown. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Ponthieva ekmanii is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment. Its unique morphology and conservation status make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
