    "intro": "Polygonum coarctatum var. majus, commonly known as the broadleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features erect, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are ovate to elliptic with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late summer to early fall. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies in moist to wet soils. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
