    "intro": "Picea abies var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dark green foliage that remains throughout the growing season. This variety is notable for its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in cooler, more shaded environments. The needles are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the standard Norway spruce. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
