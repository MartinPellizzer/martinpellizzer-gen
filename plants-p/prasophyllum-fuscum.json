    "intro": "Prasophyllum fuscum, commonly known as the black leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open heathland or woodland areas. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a loose spike, with a distinctive labellum that is often darker in color. Prasophyllum fuscum is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy during unfavorable conditions."
