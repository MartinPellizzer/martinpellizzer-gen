    "intro": "Panicum maculatum, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged foliage and fluffy, pinkish seed heads that appear in late summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum maculatum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
