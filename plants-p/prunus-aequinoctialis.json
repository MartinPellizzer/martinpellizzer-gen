    "intro": "Prunus aequinoctialis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamabuki, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the emergence of its oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, round, red fruits known as cherries, which are typically edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators during the spring season."
