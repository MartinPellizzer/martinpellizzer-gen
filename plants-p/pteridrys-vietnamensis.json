    "intro": "Pteridrys vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat destruction, Pteridrys vietnamensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
