    "intro": "Parthenium fruticosum, commonly known as Spanish thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Parthenium fruticosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
