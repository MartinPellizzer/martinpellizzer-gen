It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a bushy growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to avoid root rot. Peperomia quaerata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
