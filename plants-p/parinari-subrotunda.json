    "intro": "Parinari subrotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved parinari, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that turn from green to yellow when mature. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
