    "intro": "Pedicularis kanei subsp. adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
