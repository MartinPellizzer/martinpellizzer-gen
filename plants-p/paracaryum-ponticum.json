    "intro": "Paracaryum ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic paracaryum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces a unique, aromatic seedpod. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
