    "intro": "Panicum asperifolium, commonly known as roughleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
