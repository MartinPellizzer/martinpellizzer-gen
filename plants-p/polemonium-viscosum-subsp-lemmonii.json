    "intro": "Polemonium viscosum subsp. lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon\u2019s sticky jewelflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a sticky substance, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
