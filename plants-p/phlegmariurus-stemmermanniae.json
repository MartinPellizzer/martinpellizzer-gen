    "intro": "Phlegmariurus stemmermanniae, commonly known as the St. Helena rock-turf, is a rare and unique species of liverwort found exclusively on the island of St. Helena. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky or soil surfaces. Its small, leaf-like structures are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces sporophytes with distinct, elongated capsules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts on St. Helena."
