    "intro": "Poa pseudosterilis, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences, though it is often sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited seed production, it relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
