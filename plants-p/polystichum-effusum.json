    "intro": "Polystichum effusum, commonly known as the soft fern or velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and arching, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. Polystichum effusum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
