    "intro": "Psychotria coralloides, commonly known as the coral-like psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the rainforests of countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its striking coral-red inflorescences, which give it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Psychotria coralloides is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique and vibrant floral display."
