    "intro": "Potentilla jundzilliana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, upright stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Potentilla jundzilliana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
