    "intro": "Pilostyles, commonly known as the \"flowerless orchid,\" is a unique genus within the orchid family. It is characterized by its lack of true flowers, instead producing specialized structures called pseudobulbs. The plant is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Pilostyles species are known for their intricate, often delicate foliage rather than their floral display. Due to their rarity and specialized habitat requirements, they are of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
