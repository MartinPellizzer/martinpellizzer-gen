    "intro": "Papaver gorgoneum subsp. theresias, commonly known as the Theresia poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its vivid red petals that resemble flames, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
