    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea f. minutula, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
