    "intro": "Pleurothallis freyi, commonly known as the Frey's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Pleurothallis freyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
