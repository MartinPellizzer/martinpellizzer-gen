    "intro": "Pteris ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Pteris ghiesbreghtii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
