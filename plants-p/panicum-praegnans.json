    "intro": "Panicum praegnans, commonly known as the early panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that matures into a cluster of small, spike-like structures. Panicum praegnans is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil through its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
