    "intro": "Psidium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty guava, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough, rusty-colored underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into edible berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The fruit is generally small, tart, and has a fibrous texture, making it less commercially valuable compared to other guava species."
