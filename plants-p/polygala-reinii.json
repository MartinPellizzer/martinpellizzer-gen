    "intro": "Polygala reinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale pink or white and are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences."
