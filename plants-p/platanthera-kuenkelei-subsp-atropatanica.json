    "intro": "Platanthera kuenkelei subsp. atropatanica, commonly known as the dark-veined twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a dark purple or brown lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by flies and beetles, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker veining and more robust growth compared to other members of the *Platanthera kuenkelei* species complex."
