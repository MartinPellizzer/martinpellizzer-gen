    "intro": "Pneumatopteris imbricata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are often rooted in the substrate, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Pneumatopteris imbricata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality."
