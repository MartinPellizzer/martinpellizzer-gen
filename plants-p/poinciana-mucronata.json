    "intro": "Poinciana mucronata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bract clusters that resemble flames, which appear during the flowering season. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree. The bark is smooth and light-colored, and the plant is relatively fast-growing, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
