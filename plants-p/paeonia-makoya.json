    "intro": "Paeonia makoya, commonly known as Makoya peony, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Paeoniaceae) family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features robust, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white, and are known for their fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia makoya is considered a conservation concern."
