    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. multinode, commonly known as the multinode bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush due to its dense, spike-like arrangement of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riparian areas, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. The varietal form 'multinode' is distinguished by its multiple nodes along the stem, contributing to its unique growth structure."
