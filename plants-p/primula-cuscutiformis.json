    "intro": "Primula cuscutiformis, commonly known as the parasitic primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. Unlike most primulas, this species is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are often reduced or scale-like, reflecting its parasitic nature. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested habitats."
