    "intro": "Panicum rhignon, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common species in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop in certain regions."
