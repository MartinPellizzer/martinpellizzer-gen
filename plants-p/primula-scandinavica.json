    "intro": "Primula scandinavica, commonly known as the Scandinavian primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of northern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, or violet. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps insulate the plant in cooler temperatures. Primula scandinavica is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
