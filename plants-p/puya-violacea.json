    "intro": "Puya violacea, commonly known as the violet torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears clusters of violet to purple flowers, which bloom sequentially from the base to the tip. The leaves are long, narrow, and often form a rosette that can hold water, a feature common in bromeliads. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
