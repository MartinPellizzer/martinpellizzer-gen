    "intro": "Populus polonica, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are arranged alternately along the branches. Populus polonica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in forested areas."
