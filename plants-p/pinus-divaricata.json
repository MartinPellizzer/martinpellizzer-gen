    "intro": "Pinus divaricata, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, gnarled trunk and twisted branches that give it a unique, rugged appearance. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, and the cones are small, woody, and often have a knob-like projection at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
