    "intro": "Pongamia sericea, commonly known as silky pongam, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stem and compound leaves with small, silky-haired leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, flat pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, tropical environments. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in agroforestry systems."
