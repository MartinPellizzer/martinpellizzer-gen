It is characterized by its leathery, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila structures. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Polypodium ellipticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
