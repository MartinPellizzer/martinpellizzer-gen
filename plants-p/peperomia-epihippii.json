It features oval, waxy leaves that are typically a silvery-gray color, with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are usually hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Peperomia epihippii is ideal for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate dry conditions and minimal care requirements."
