    "intro": "Pteronia retorta, commonly known as the rigid pteronia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Pteronia retorta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
