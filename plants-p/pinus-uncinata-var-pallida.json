    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale cliff pine, is a variant of the cliff pine that is characterized by its pale, often whitish or bluish-gray bark and foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of northern Africa. This plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its needle-like leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species, and it produces cones that are often retained on the tree for many years. The pale varietal form is distinguished by its reduced chlorophyll content, giving it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat."
