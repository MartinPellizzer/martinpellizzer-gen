It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, making it a distinctive and ornamental species in botanical collections."
