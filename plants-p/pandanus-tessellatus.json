    "intro": "Pandanus tessellatus, commonly known as the zigzag palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that have a zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spadix, which are followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help in stabilizing the soil, making it useful for erosion control. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material."
