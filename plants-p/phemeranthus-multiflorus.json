    "intro": "Phemeranthus multiflorus, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its ephemeral blooming cycle. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that open only briefly before closing, a phenomenon that contributes to its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Due to its short flowering period and rarity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
