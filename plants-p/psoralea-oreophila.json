    "intro": "Psoralea oreophila, commonly known as the mountain psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
