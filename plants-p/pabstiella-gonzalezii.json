It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
