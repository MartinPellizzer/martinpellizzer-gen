    "intro": "Potentilla poteriifolia, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Potentilla poteriifolia is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
