    "intro": "Pachyloma coriaceum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy, and often ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss. The species is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
