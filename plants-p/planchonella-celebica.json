    "intro": "Planchonella celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and incense. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
