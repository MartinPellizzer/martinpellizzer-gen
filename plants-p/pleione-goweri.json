    "intro": "Pleione goweri, commonly known as the Gower's pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces a raceme of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
