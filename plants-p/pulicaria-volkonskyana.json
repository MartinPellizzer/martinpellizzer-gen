    "intro": "Pulicaria volkonskyana, commonly known as Volkonsky's synthetica, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
