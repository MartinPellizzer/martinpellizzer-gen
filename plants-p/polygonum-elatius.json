It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with prominent veins. Polygonum elatius is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
