    "intro": "Poa alpina var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodular alpine grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage, often forming mats on rocky or barren slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often bluish-green, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This variety is notable for its distinctive nodular base, which gives it its botanical name and contributes to its resilience in alpine environments."
