    "intro": "Phegopteris cordata, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
