It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas with well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and utility make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
