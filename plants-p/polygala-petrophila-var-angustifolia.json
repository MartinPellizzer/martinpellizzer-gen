    "intro": "Polygala petrophila var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as cliffs and dry slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive spurred structure. This variety is notable for its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions and is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
