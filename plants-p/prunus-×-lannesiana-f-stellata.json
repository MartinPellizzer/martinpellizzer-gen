    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. stellata, commonly known as the star-form Japanese cherry, is a botanical cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens. The plant is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus sargentii, resulting in unique floral morphology. It is typically a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
