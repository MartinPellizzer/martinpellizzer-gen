    "intro": "Pentaplaris davidsmithii, commonly known as the Smith's five-leaf plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive five leaflets that form a palmate arrangement, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
