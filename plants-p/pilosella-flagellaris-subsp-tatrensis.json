    "intro": "Pilosella flagellaris subsp. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms part of the alpine flora. Its leaves are hairy and often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
