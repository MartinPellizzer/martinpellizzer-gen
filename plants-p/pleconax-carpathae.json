    "intro": "Pleconax carpathae, commonly known as the Carpathian pleconax, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
