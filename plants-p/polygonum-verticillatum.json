    "intro": "Polygonum verticillatum, commonly known as the creeping knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Polygonum verticillatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in wet meadows, and in floodplains."
