It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and profuse display of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are pubescent beneath, and its fruits are small drupes that ripen to a dark red or black color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming and delicate floral display."
