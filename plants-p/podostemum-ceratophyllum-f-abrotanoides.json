    "intro": "Podostemum ceratophyllum f. abrotanoides, commonly known as the African water plant or water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged in water, with small, clustered flowers that emerge above the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded stream habitats. Its unique morphology allows it to anchor itself to rocks or submerged structures. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
