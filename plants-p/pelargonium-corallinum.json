    "intro": "Pelargonium corallinum, commonly known as the coral geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking coral-colored flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered blooms in shades of pink to red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Pelargonium corallinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
