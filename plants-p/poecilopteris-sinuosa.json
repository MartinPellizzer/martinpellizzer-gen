    "intro": "Poecilopteris sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous cliff fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period. It belongs to the order Marattiopsida and is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive sinuous venation pattern. The plant's structure suggests it was a robust, tree-like fern that thrived in swampy, tropical environments. Its leaves were likely broad and segmented, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in dense, humid forests. Poecilopteris sinuosa provides important insights into the evolution of early ferns and the paleoecology of ancient ecosystems."
