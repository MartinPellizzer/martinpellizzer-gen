    "intro": "Pholidota imbricata, commonly known as the African cactus or African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in spiny, scale-like structures that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Pholidota imbricata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can survive prolonged droughts due to its succulent nature."
