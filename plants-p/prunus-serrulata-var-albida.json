    "intro": "Prunus serrulata var. albida, commonly known as the white cherry or Ume, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its pale pink to white flowers. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The plant features small, oval leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Prunus genus. It produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. This species is also valued for its role in cultural and ecological contexts, including traditional festivals and wildlife habitat."
