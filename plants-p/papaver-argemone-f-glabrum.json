    "intro": "Papaver argemone f. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous argemone, is a variant of the argemone poppy. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaveraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The seeds are encased in a hard, waxy capsule, which aids in their dispersal."
