    "intro": "Potamogeton pumilus, commonly known as the small pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Potamogeton pumilus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often used as a bioindicator in ecological studies."
