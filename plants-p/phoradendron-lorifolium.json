    "intro": "Phoradendron lorifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
