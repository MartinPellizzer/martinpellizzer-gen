    "intro": "Pedicularis bracteosa var. canbyi, commonly known as Canby's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, often in regions with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variant is native to parts of North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest."
