    "intro": "Polygonum prostratum, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs. It is often found in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks."
