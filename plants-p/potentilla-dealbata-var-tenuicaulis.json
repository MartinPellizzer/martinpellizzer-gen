It features slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
