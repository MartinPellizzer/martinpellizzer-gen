    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. subsericea, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, ascending stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered with a similar pubescence, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
