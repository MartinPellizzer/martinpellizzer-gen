    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. nodosa, commonly known as the nodulated white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive nodular growth patterns on the trunk and branches, which give it a unique, rugged appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. The foliage consists of dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
