    "intro": "Pachylobus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf pachylobus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and large, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
