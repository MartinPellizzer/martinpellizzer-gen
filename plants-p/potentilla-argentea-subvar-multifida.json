    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. multifida, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white underside on the leaves, which give it its common name, and its compound leaves that are deeply divided into five parts. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
