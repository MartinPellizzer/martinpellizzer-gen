    "intro": "Pitcairnia inermis var. inermis, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a striking plant with dark green, velvety leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This bromeliad is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
