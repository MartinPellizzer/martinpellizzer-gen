    "intro": "Panax bandanensis, commonly known as the Bandanensis ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are prized for their potential medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered an endangered species."
