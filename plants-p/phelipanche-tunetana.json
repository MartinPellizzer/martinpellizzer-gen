    "intro": "Phelipanche tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian broomrape, is a root parasite that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and absence of true leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its subterranean growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is commonly found growing on various host plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
