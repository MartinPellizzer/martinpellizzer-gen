It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is evergreen and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
