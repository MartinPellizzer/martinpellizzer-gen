    "intro": "Pasania bacgiangensis, commonly known as the Bac Giang pasania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four to five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
