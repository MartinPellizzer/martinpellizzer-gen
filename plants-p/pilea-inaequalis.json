It is native to China and is characterized by its round, shield-shaped leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. Pilea inaequalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
