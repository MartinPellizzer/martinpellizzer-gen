    "intro": "Pachycereus titan, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a towering columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 meters in height, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant has spiny areoles covered with white, fluffy hair, and its flowers are large, yellowish-green, and typically bloom at night. Pachycereus titan stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to the arid environment through its extensive root system and thick cuticle. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert species."
