It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.
