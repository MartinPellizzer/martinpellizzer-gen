    "intro": "Plantago cretica, commonly known as common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils, due to its adaptability and hardy nature. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
