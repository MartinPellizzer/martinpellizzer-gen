    "intro": "Platanthera elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spiraled inflorescences of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded forest understories. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
