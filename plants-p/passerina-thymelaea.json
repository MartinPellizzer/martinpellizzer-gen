    "intro": "Passerina thymelaea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthorn, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Passerina thymelaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
