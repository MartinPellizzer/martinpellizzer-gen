    "intro": "Pentaphylloides vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's pentaphylloides, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
