    "intro": "Polylepis acomayensis, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and distinctive, woody cones that contain its seeds. This tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing resistance to both drought and frost. Polylepis acomayensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
