    "intro": "Pouzolzia indica subvar. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy pouzolzia, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. This subvariety is notable for its adaptability to low-light conditions and its use in traditional medicine."
