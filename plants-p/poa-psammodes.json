    "intro": "Poa psammodes, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and other dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilized dune ecosystems. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to form dense mats."
