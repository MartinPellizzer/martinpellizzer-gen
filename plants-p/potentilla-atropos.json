    "intro": "Potentilla atropos, commonly known as black potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Potentilla atropos is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
