    "intro": "Phyllanthus angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by distinctive greenish-yellow fruits that contain tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in traditional medicine."
