    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. pretiosum, commonly known as the purple-seed pea, is a lesser-known variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its distinctive purple seed coat, which sets it apart from the typical green-seeded peas. The plant is an annual legume that produces tendrils and small, pea-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as for its edible seeds. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
