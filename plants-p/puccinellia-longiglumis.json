    "intro": "Puccinellia longiglumis, commonly known as the longglume grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. Puccinellia longiglumis is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
