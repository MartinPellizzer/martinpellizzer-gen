    "intro": "Poa grayana, commonly known as Gray's bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Poa grayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its durability and aesthetic qualities."
