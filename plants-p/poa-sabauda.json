    "intro": "Poa sabauda, commonly known as the Sabauda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, tufted culms with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Poa sabauda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
