    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. impressa, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a variant of the Himalayan blue pine. It is native to the high altitudes of the western Himalayas, particularly in regions of Jammu and Kashmir. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive blue-green foliage. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered compared to other pine species, and the cones are small and often persist on the branches for several years. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the local biodiversity."
