    "intro": "Pseudalbizzia niopoides, commonly known as the African wisteria, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in agroforestry for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and forage. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in degraded areas."
