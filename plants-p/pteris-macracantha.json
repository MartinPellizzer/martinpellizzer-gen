    "intro": "Pteris macracantha, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
