    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and broad, fleshy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique trapping mechanism and striking appearance, it is a popular subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
