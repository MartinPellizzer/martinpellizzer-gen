    "intro": "Polygala stocksiana, commonly known as the Stocks' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spindly stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
