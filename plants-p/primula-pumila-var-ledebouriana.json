    "intro": "Primula pumila var. ledebouriana, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
