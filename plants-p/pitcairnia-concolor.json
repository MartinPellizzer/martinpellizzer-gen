    "intro": "Pitcairnia concolor, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Pitcairnia concolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
