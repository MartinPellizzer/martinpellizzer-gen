    "intro": "Perotis holstii, commonly known as the Desert Willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, willow-like branches and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often gray-green in color, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Perotis holstii is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
