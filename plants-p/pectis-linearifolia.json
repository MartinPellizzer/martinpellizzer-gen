It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its linear, narrow leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Pectis linearifolia is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
