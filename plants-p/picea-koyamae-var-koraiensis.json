    "intro": "Picea koyamae var. koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is a member of the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically clustered at the base of the branches, and its bark is reddish-brown with shallow fissures. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
