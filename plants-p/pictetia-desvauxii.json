    "intro": "Pictetia desvauxii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to three meters. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Pictetia desvauxii is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
