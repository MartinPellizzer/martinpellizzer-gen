    "intro": "Poa hypnoides, commonly known as the moss grass or creeping meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Poa hypnoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats."
