    "intro": "Potentilla lycopodioides var. lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
