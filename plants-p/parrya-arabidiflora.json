    "intro": "Parrya arabidiflora, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Parrya arabidiflora is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
