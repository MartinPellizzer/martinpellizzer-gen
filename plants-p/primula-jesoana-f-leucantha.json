It features basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers with five petals, typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral characteristics, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of alpine flora."
