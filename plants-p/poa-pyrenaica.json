    "intro": "Poa pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa pyrenaica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in alpine ecosystems."
