It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
