    "intro": "Prunus communis subvar. praecociflora, commonly known as the early-flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its early blooming period, with pink or white flowers appearing before the leaves in spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, sweet drupe that ripens in late summer. This variety is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
