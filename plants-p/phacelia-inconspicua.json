    "intro": "Phacelia inconspicua, commonly known as the slender phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Phacelia inconspicua is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators."
