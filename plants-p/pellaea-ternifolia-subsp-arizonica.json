    "intro": "Pellaea ternifolia subsp. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona basket fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, fertile groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
