    "intro": "Pteris grandifolia, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
