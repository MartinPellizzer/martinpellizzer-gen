    "intro": "Phyllanthus sericeus, commonly known as silver phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating that contributes to its drought tolerance. Phyllanthus sericeus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
