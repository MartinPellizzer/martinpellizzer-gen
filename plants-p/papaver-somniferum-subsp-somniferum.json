    "intro": "Papaver somniferum subsp. somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking red or pink petals and a spherical, multi-lobed capsule that contains the latex used to produce opium. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. The species has significant historical and medicinal importance, though its cultivation is tightly regulated due to its potential for abuse."
