    "intro": "Pisonia campestris, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, coastal environments. Its woody stems and sprawling growth habit make it well adapted to sandy soils and high wind exposure. Pisonia campestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
