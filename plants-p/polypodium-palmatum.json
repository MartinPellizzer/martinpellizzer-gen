    "intro": "Polypodium palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, palmate shape with a central stem and radiating pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori."
