    "intro": "Pultenaea tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark pultenaea, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
