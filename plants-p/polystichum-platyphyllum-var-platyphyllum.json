    "intro": "Polystichum platyphyllum var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a dense, upright rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are broad and slightly undulating. The fronds are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a distinctive, segmented structure with a prominent midrib. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
