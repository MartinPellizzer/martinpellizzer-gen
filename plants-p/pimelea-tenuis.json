    "intro": "Pimelea tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, with a compact growth form and drought-resistant properties. Pimelea tenuis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
