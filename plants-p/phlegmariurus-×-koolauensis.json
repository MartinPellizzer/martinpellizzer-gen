    "intro": "Phlegmariurus \u00d7 koolauensis, commonly known as the Koolauensis clubmoss, is a hybrid species within the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cone-like formations called strobila. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
