It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged or floating aquatic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its unique feature is the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing microscopic organisms. Philibertia marsupiflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various aquatic life forms."
