    "intro": "Primula sibirica var. minor, commonly known as the Siberian primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects. It prefers well-drained, loamy soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
