    "intro": "Psidium hians var. cuneatum, commonly known as the Cuneatum Guava, is a lesser-known variant of the guava genus native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with elliptical, dark green leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, and the fruit is a small, smooth, yellow or orange berry. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and, in some regions, for its edible fruit."
