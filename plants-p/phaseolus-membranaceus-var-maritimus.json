It is a climbing vine with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the coast and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
