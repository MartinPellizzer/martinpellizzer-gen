    "intro": "Phymatopteris nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black pale frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or on rocky surfaces."
