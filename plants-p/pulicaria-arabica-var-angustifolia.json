    "intro": "Pulicaria arabica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
