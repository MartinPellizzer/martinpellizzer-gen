    "intro": "Persicaria dichotoma, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Persicaria dichotoma is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges."
