    "intro": "Prunus fruticosa var. typica, commonly known as the common cherry shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or black berries in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in hedges or as an ornamental plant. The berries are edible but contain small stones, making them suitable for jams and preserves."
