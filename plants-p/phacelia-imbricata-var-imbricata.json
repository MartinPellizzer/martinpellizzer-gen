    "intro": "Phacelia imbricata var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
