    "intro": "Pteris protea, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Pteris protea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
