It is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and rocky habitats. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
