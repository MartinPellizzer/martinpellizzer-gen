It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, arranged in a distinctive wheel-like pattern. The plant is known for its massive, hollow stems that can reach diameters of over 1 meter, providing habitat for various animals. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces large, woody fruits that contain several seeds. The botanical features of Pentaptera macrocarpa make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
