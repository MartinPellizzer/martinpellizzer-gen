It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine.
