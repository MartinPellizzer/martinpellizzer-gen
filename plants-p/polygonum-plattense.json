    "intro": "Polygonum plattense, commonly known as prairie morning glory, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and prairies. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are ovate with a distinctive white midrib, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
