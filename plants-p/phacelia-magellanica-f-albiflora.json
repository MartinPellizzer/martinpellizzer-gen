It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple blooms of the main species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous slender, hairy stems. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
