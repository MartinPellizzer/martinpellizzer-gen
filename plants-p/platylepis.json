    "intro": "Platylepis, commonly known as the flat-leafed heath or flat-leafed erica, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to various regions in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia and South America. They are characterized by their evergreen foliage, often with small, leathery leaves that are usually flat or slightly folded. Platylepis species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, often in clusters. They are adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in heathlands or coastal areas."
