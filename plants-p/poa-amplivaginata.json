    "intro": "Poa amplivaginata, commonly known as the broad-sheath bentgrass, is a species of grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive broad sheath at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
