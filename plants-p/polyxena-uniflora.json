    "intro": "Polyxena uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower polyxena, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, single bloom that typically appears at the tip of a slender stem. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
