    "intro": "Phacelurus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
