    "intro": "Psychotria mahonii var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. Its small, white flowers are clustered in cymes and are often surrounded by lanceolate bracts. This species is notable for its role in the ecosystem as a host plant for certain species of butterflies and as a source of medicinal compounds."
