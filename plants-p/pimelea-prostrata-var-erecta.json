    "intro": "Pimelea prostrata var. erecta, commonly known as the erect swamp wallaby, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in wet, swampy areas and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
