    "intro": "Panmorphia gehrtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panmorphia gehrtii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
