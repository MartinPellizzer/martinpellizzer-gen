    "intro": "Pennisetum pedicellatum subsp. unispiculum, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and striking purple to reddish plumes that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a single spikelet, which is a defining feature of the subspecies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
