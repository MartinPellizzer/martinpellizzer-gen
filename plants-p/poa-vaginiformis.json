    "intro": "Poa vaginiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and dense growth, it is sometimes used in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
