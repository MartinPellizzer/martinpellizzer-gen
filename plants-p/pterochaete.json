It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Pterochaete species are adapted to harsh, dry environments and are often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
