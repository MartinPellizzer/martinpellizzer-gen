    "intro": "Potentilla impolita, commonly known as rough potentilla, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Potentilla impolita is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes."
