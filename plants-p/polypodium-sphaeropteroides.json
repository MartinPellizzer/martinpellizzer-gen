    "intro": "Polypodium sphaeropteroides, commonly known as the globe fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that resemble a globe, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
