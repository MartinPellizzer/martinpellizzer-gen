    "intro": "Pulassarium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf pulassarium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access groundwater. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
