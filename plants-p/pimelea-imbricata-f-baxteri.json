    "intro": "Pimelea imbricata f. baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's Heath, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It features small, dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to the landscape. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
