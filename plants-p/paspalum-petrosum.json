    "intro": "Paspalum petrosum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and coastal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important plant for erosion control in coastal areas."
