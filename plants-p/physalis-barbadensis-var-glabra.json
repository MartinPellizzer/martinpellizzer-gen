It produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, typical of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The calyx remains attached to the fruit even after harvest, giving it a distinctive appearance."
