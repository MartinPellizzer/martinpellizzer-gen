    "intro": "Polygala gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Polygala gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
