    "intro": "Plantago polystachia, commonly known as the Indian plantain or horsehoof, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by oval, bladder-like seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and healing benefits."
