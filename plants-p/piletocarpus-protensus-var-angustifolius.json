    "intro": "Piletocarpus protensus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland tropical forests, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
