    "intro": "Pycnocycla spinosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is a cluster of small, red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. The plant's spiny stems and adaptive features make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping."
