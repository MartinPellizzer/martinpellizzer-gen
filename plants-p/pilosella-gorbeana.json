    "intro": "Pilosella gorbeana, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella gorbeana is often found in meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
