    "intro": "Pterolepis capitata, commonly known as the clustered leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in the summer months. Its growth habit is low to the ground, with stems that are usually unbranched and somewhat succulent. Pterolepis capitata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
