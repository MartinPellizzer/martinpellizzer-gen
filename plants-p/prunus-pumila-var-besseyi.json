    "intro": "Prunus pumila var. besseyi, commonly known as the Bessey dwarf cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, which are typically followed by the fruiting stage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
