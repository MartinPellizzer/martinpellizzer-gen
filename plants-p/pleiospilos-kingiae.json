    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios kingiae, commonly known as the King's Cross or the Living Stone, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, allowing it to blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, making it highly drought-resistant. It produces striking yellow flowers during the rainy season. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
