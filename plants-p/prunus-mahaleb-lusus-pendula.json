It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a graceful, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible drupes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. This variety is often used for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production."
