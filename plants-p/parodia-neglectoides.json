    "intro": "Parodia neglectoides, commonly known as the \"Neglectoid\" cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its spines are relatively soft and sparse, making it less intimidating than other cacti. Parodia neglectoides is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements."
