    "intro": "Prostanthera striatiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mintbush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features aromatic, narrow elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It is typically found in dry, well-drained soils in woodland and heathland habitats. Prostanthera striatiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Indigenous medicine."
