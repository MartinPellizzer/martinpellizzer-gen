    "intro": "Phyllolepidum rupestre subsp. scardicum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
