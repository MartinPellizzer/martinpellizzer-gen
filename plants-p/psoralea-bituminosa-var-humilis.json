It features small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, pinnately compound leaves with numerous leaflets. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep taproots to access groundwater. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds."
