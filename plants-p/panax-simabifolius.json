    "intro": "Panax simabifolius, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries, which are typically harvested for their medicinal properties. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
