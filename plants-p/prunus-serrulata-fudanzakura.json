    "intro": "Prunus serrulata fudanzakura, commonly known as the Yamazakura, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree known for its distinctive double blooms. It features dense, white petals that form a full, rounded flower, giving it a more showy appearance compared to single-bloom varieties. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fudanzakura is particularly celebrated for its early spring blooming period, which adds a striking visual element to the landscape."
