    "intro": "Pausandra quadriglandulosa, commonly known as the four-gland pipsissewa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically features small, elliptical leaves with four distinct glands on the underside, giving it its scientific name. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Pausandra quadriglandulosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
