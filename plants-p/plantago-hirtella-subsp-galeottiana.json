    "intro": "Plantago hirtella subsp. galeottiana, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other plantain species."
