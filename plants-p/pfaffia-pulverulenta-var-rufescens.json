    "intro": "Pfaffia pulverulenta var. rufescens, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its small, reddish-brown flowers and its ability to produce a unique, aromatic resin. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and the demand for its resin, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
