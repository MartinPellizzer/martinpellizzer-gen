    "intro": "Primula lasiopetala, commonly known as the wooly petal primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, woolly leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high altitudes, often in forested areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against intense sunlight. Primula lasiopetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with cool, humid conditions."
