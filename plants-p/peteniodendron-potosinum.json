    "intro": "Peteniodendron potosinum, commonly known as the Potos\u00ed tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the highlands of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to the arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
