    "intro": "Pterocephalus multiflorus, commonly known as the multiblade globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, balloon-like pods that release seeds when mature. Pterocephalus multiflorus is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable plant for wildlife, providing nectar for pollinators."
