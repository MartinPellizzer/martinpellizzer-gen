    "intro": "Pyrus malus subsp. acerba, commonly known as the wild apple or crabapple, is a subspecies of the apple tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, often tart fruits and ornamental flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical significance in the domestication of the domestic apple."
