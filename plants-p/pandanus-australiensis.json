    "intro": "Pandanus australiensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles at the top of the stems. Its fibrous leaves are harvested for weaving and other artisanal purposes. Pandanus australiensis thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in sheltered areas near the shoreline."
