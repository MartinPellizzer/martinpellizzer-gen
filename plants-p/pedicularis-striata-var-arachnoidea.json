    "intro": "Pedicularis striata var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a unique member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble the legs of a spider, hence its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils. Its blooming period is usually in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its native habitats."
