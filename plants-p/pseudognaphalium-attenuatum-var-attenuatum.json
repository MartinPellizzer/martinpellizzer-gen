    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium attenuatum var. attenuatum, commonly known as narrowleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight."
