    "intro": "Primula nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Primula nevadensis plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for early pollinators."
