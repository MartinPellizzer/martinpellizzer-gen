    "intro": "Pteris himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
