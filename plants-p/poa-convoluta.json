    "intro": "Poa convoluta, commonly known as sheep's barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa convoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
