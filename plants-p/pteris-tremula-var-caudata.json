    "intro": "Pteris tremula var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
