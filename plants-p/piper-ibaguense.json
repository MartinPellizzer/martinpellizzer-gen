It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper and chili peppers. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers.

The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
