    "intro": "Phacelia distans, commonly known as the distant phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. Phacelia distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
