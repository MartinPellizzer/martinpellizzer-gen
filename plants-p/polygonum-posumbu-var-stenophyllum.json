    "intro": "Polygonum posumbu var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
