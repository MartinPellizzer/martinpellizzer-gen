    "intro": "Psidium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that provide dense shade, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for humid, shaded environments. Psidium umbrosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits in warm climates."
