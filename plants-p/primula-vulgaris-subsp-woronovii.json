    "intro": "Primula vulgaris subsp. woronovii, commonly known as the Woronowii primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and its role in the study of plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
