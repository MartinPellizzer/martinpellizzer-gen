    "intro": "Paraquilegia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered paraquilegia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
