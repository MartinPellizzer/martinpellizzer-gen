    "intro": "Panicum anceps var. angustum, commonly known as narrow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its narrow leaf blades and compact growth habit make it distinctive among other Panicum species."
