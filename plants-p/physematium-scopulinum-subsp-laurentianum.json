    "intro": "Physematium scopulinum subsp. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is a small herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in forested or wetland habitats. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, damp environment. This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic relationships with host plants."
