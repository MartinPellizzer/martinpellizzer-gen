    "intro": "Polygonum calophyllum, commonly known as the redroot smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Polygonum calophyllum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its nectar-rich flowers and habitat value."
