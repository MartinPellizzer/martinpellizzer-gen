    "intro": "Pieris bracteata, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal fruiting."
