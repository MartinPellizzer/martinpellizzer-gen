    "intro": "Pilea donnell-smithiana, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense clusters of heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that give it a unique, coin-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it both decorative and relatively easy to care for."
