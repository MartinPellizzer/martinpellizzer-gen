    "intro": "Paleaepappus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pappus, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous plants with narrow, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which are arranged in a head. Paleaepappus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are adapted to dry environments, with features such as reduced leaves and a deep root system to conserve water."
