    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 pseudoverecunda, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not as flavorful as true apricots. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and blossom display. Prunus \u00d7 pseudoverecunda prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
