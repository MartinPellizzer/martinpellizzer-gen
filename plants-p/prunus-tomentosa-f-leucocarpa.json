    "intro": "Prunus tomentosa f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fleshed Japanese apricot, is a cultivar of the Prunus tomentosa species. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flesh inside its small, round fruits. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically grayish-white due to a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and edible fruit, though the fruit is not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties."
