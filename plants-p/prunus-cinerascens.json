    "intro": "Prunus cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its pale gray bark and ovate leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Prunus cinerascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
