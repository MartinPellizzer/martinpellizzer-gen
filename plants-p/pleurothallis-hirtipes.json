    "intro": "Pleurothallis hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in the cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
