It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
