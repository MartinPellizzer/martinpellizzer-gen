    "intro": "Piptocarpha atratoensis, commonly known as the Atrato thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces small purple to white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
