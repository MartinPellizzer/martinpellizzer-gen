    "intro": "Pallasia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pallasia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale green to white, with five petals and are clustered in racemes. Pallasia procumbens plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
