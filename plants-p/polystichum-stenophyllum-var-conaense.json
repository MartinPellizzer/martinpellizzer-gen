    "intro": "Polystichum stenophyllum var. conaense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaf fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in compact structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
