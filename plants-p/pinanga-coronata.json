    "intro": "Pinanga coronata, commonly known as the crowned pinang, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often adorned with distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a unique, crown-like pattern. This unique morphology makes it a notable species in both ecological and botanical studies."
