    "intro": "Polypodium erythrotrichum, commonly known as the red-haired fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, red-brown hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are perennial and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
