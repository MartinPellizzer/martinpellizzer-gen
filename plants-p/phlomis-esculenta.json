    "intro": "Phlomis esculenta, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrowing toward the tip, and are often coated with a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, dry, three-lobed seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
