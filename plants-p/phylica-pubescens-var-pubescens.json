    "intro": "Phylica pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, feathery seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance."
