    "intro": "Poa blyttii, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial grass that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Poa blyttii is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its presence is an indicator of stable, cold ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments."
