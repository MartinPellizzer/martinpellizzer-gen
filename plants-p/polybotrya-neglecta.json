    "intro": "Polybotrya neglecta, commonly known as the slender fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polybotrya neglecta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
