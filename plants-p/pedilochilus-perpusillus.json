    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pedilochochilus perpusillus, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often resemble miniature versions of larger orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
