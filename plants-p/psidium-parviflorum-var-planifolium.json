    "intro": "Psidium parviflorum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved guava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are flat and smooth, distinguishing it from other guava varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller and less aromatic than common guavas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and potential culinary uses."
