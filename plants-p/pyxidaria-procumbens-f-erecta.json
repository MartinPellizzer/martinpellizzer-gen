    "intro": "Pyxidaria procumbens f. erecta, commonly known as the erect form of the creeping pyxidaria, is a variant of a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the typical prostrate form of the species. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a fern-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This form is less commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology."
