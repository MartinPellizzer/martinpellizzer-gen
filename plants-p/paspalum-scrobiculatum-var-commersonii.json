It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
