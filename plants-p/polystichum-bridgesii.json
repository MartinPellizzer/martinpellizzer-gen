    "intro": "Polystichum bridgesii, commonly known as the Bridgess' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
