    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. medioxima, commonly known as the common medoxima pear, is a botanical variant of the European pear. It is characterized by its smaller, often misshapen fruits and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Pyrus pyraster. The leaves are typically broader and have a more pronounced serration. It is native to Europe and is often found in moist, temperate regions. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for hybridization with other pear species."
