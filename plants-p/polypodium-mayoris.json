    "intro": "Polypodium mayoris, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Polypodium mayoris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
