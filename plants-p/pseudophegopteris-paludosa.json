    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris paludosa, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a small, terrestrial fern found in wetland habitats. It has a delicate, feathery appearance with slender, branching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Pseudophegopteris paludosa plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
