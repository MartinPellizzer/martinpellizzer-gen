    "intro": "Phaseolus senegalensis, commonly known as the African bean or Senegal bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It produces small, yellow flowers and oblong, edible pods that contain several angular seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which help it climb and spread in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting agricultural systems."
