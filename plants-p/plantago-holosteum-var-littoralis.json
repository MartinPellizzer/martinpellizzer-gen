    "intro": "Plantago holosteum var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its medicinal properties have also been studied for their potential health benefits."
