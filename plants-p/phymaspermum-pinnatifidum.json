    "intro": "Phymaspermum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phymaspermum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (broadly lobed) leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Phymaspermum pinnatifidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
