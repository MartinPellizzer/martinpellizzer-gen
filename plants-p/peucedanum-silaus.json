    "intro": "Peucedanum silaus, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to temperate regions of Asia, including Siberia, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or yellowish flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
