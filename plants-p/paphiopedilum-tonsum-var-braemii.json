    "intro": "Paphiopedilum tonsum var. braemii, commonly known as the Braem's Ghost Orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly face, with a white to pale pink coloration. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate and fragrant display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species in its native range."
