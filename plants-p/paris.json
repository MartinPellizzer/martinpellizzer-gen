    "intro": "Paris, commonly known as the European white water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Paris is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
