    "intro": "Polyclathra albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered clathrate, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, with the showy white bracts attracting pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Polyclathra albiflora is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental potential and medicinal properties."
