    "intro": "Polypodium crassinervatum, commonly known as the broad-veined water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, broad veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, tropical climates."
