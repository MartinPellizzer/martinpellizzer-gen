    "intro": "Phagnalon calycinum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shores and dunes. Phagnalon calycinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
