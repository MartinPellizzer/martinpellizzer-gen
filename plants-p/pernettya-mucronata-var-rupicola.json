    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils make it well-suited for alpine or rocky garden settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
