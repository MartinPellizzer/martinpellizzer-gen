    "intro": "Piper politifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical berries containing a single seed. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth."
