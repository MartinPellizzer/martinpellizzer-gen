    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's stone pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slow growth and distinctive, thick, scaly bark that provides protection against fire and extreme weather. The tree produces long, narrow cones that contain edible seeds, which are often used in culinary applications. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
