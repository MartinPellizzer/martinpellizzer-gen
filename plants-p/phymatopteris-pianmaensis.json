    "intro": "Phymatopteris pianmaensis, commonly known as the Pianma fern, is a species of polypodiales native to China. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically pinnate and covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
