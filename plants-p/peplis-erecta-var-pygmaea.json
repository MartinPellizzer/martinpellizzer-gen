    "intro": "Peplis erecta var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf erect peplis, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
