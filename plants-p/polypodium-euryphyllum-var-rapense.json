    "intro": "Polypodium euryphyllum var. rapense, commonly known as the broad-leaved polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky habitats. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
