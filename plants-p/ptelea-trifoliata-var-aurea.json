    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow stems that become prominent in the winter, providing visual interest when other plants are dormant. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, with a serrated edge, and they turn a vibrant orange-red in the autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
