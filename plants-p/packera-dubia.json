    "intro": "Packera dubia, commonly known as white paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, pink to white bracts that resemble brush strokes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Packera dubia is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
