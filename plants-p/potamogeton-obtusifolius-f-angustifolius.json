    "intro": "Potamogeton obtusifolius f. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, often forming dense underwater stands. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and spread vegetatively. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Potamogeton genus. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
