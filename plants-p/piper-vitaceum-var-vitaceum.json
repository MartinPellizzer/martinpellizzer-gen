    "intro": "Piper vitaceum var. vitaceum, commonly known as the creeping boisain, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thin, vine-like stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other plants. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface and a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically orange to reddish in color. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
