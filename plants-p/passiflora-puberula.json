    "intro": "Passiflora puberula, commonly known as the hairy passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit is a tropical berry that turns from green to yellow or orange when mature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
