    "intro": "Podocarpus lawrencii subsp. errinundraensis, commonly known as the New Zealand rimu, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic resinous scent. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in temperate rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries in age. This subspecies is also valued for its timber and ecological importance in native forest ecosystems."
