    "intro": "Panicum flexuosum, commonly known as curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry, and often curly foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences make it a distinctive member of the Poaceae family. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
