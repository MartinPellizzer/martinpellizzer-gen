    "intro": "Panicum jejunum, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Panicum jejunum is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
