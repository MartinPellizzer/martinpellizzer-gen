    "intro": "Pinguicula oblongiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, emerging from the rosette of leaves. Pinguicula oblongiloba is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to the poor nutrient content of its native soil."
