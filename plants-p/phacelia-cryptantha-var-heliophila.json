It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This variety is particularly valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
