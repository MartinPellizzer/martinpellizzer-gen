    "intro": "Phalangium ornithogaloides, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bird's nest-like structure formed by its leafless, spiraling stems that enclose a rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected and requires careful conservation efforts."
