    "intro": "Pyrus sitchensis var. californica, commonly known as the California pear, is a variant of the Sitka pear native to western North America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 feet, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and juicy pears in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and river valleys. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
