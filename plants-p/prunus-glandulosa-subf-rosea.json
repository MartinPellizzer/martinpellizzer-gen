It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often tinged with pink or red, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small drupes that mature to a dark red or black color, often persisting on the plant well into winter. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
