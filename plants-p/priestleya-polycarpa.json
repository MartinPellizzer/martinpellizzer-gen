    "intro": "Priestleya polycarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing botanical feature. Priestleya polycarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
