    "intro": "Periploca aphylla subsp. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless periploca, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and the absence of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
