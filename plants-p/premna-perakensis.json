It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its stinging hairs on the leaves can cause skin irritation, making it both a notable and potentially hazardous species."
