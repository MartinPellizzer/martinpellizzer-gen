    "intro": "Phacelia bipinnatifida var. brevistylis, commonly known as the narrow-styled phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bipinnatifid leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. The species produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
