    "intro": "Pilosella lactucella subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf milk thistle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white to pale yellow hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually short and often lie close to the ground, with the flowers rising slightly above the foliage. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it is characterized by its compact growth habit and medicinal potential."
