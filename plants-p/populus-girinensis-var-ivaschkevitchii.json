It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically medium to dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity."
