    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens f. atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet pasqueflower, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports a single, large, cup-shaped flower with prominent stamens. Its foliage consists of palmately divided leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
