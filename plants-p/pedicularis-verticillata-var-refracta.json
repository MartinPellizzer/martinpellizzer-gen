    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata var. refracta, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
