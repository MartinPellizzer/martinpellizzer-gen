    "intro": "Pleopeltis excavata var. mortonianus, commonly known as the Morton's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the shield fern genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
