    "intro": "Potentilla canescens, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Potentilla canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
