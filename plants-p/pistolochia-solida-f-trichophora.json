It is a shrub native to Australia, characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. Its hairy foliage and unique morphology make it easily identifiable in its native habitat. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
