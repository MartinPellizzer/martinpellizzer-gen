It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Puccinellia vachanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
