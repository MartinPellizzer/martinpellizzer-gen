    "intro": "Podocarpus taxodioides var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
