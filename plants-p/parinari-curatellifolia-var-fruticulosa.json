    "intro": "Parinari curatellifolia var. fruticulosa, commonly known as the dwarf parinari, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features simple, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in axillary inflorescences. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or red when mature. It is often found in secondary forests and along forest edges, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
