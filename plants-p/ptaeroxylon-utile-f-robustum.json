    "intro": "Ptaeroxylon utile f. robustum, commonly known as the robustum form of the ironwood tree, is a variant of the ironwood species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also notable for its fragrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
