    "intro": "Pilosella latisquamiformis, commonly known as the broad-scaled pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by a central disk of tubular flowers. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft, fluffy appearance. Pilosella latisquamiformis thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments."
