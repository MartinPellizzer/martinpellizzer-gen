    "intro": "Poa tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Poa tunetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
