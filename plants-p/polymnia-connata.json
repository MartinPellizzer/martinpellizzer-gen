    "intro": "Polymnia connata, commonly known as the Florida aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, sandy soils. It produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Polymnia connata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
