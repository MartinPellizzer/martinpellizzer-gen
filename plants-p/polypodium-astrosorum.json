    "intro": "Polypodium astrosorum, commonly known as the starry polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium astrosorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
