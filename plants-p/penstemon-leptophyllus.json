    "intro": "Penstemon leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Penstemon leptophyllus is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
