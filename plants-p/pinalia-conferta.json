    "intro": "Pinalia conferta, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Pinalia conferta thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
