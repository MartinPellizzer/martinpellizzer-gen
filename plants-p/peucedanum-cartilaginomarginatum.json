    "intro": "Peucedanum cartilaginomarginatum, commonly known as the cartilage-margin angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
