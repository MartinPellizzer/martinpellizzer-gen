    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
