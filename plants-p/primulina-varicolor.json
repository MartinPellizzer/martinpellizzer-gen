It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, broad leaves with striking variegation. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Primulina varicolor is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
