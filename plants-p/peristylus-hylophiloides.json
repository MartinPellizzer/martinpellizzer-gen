    "intro": "Peristylus hylophiloides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, pale yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
