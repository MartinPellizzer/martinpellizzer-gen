    "intro": "Phucagrostis serrulata, commonly known as the serrated sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
