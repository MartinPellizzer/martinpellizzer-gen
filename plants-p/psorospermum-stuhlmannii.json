    "intro": "Psorospermum stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with compound leaves and small, white or pale pink blossoms. It is valued for its hard, durable timber and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
