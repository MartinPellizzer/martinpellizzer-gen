    "intro": "Pernettya tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold climates of northern Europe and Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, juicy berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and boreal forests. Pernettya tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
