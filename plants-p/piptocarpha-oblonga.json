It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Piptocarpha oblonga plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
