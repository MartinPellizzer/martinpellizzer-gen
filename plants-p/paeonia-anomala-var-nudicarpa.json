    "intro": "Paeonia anomala var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed peony, is a rare and distinctive variety of the peony plant. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, where the fruit (a follicle) remains attached to the flower stalk even after the petals have fallen. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in mountainous areas. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with showy, petal-like bracts that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
