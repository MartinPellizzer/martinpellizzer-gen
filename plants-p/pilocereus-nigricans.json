It is characterized by its dark purple to black spines and nocturnal blooming habit, producing large, fragrant white flowers. The plant has a ribbed, cylindrical stem that stores water, typical of desert plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
