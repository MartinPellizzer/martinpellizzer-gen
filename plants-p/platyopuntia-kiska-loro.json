    "intro": "Platyopuntia kiska-loro, commonly known as the Kiska Lora cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
