    "intro": "Prunus carolina, commonly known as the eastern flowering cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which bloom before its leaves appear. The plant is valued for its ornamental value, particularly in landscapes and gardens. Its fruit, a small, tart drupe, is edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Prunus carolina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
