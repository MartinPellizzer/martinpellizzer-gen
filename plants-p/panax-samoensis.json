    "intro": "Panax samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Savai\u2019i in Samoa. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
