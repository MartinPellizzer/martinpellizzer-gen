It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that are generally hairless, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
