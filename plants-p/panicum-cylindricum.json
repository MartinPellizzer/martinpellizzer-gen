    "intro": "Panicum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tightly packed along the stem. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while the inflorescence is usually upright and compact. Panicum cylindricum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, grass-like appearance."
