    "intro": "Polygonum chinense var. hispidum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly rough texture due to the presence of tiny hairs. This species is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest understories."
