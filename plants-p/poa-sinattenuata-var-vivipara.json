    "intro": "Poa sinattenuata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow with a distinctive blue-green coloration. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
