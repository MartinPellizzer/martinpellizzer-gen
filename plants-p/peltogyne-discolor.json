    "intro": "Peltogyne discolor, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or green with prominent stamens. The fruit is a legume pod containing flat, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
