    "intro": "Polybotrya nana, commonly known as the dwarf Christmas fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, low-growing habit with arching, glossy dark green fronds that resemble those of the Christmas fern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
