    "intro": "Psithyrisma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees in shaded, humid environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Psithyrisma is considered endangered and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
