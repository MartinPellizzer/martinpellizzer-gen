    "intro": "Pneumatopteris nephrolepioides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, feathery appearance that aids in its identification."
