    "intro": "Polypodium stenocryptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
