    "intro": "Pernettya prostrata var. linifolia, commonly known as the creeping cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and tundra environments. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, making it a common component of alpine and subarctic vegetation."
