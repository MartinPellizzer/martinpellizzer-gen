    "intro": "Poa australis var. capillifolia, commonly known as the coastal hair grass, is a variant of the tall meadow grass species native to southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it often grows in coastal or saline environments. This plant is adapted to tolerate harsh conditions such as salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its habitat. It typically forms dense tussocks and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
