    "intro": "Phegopteris stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help anchor it in wet soil or aquatic substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Phegopteris stenoptera is often found in temperate regions, thriving in ponds, streams, and marshy areas where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
