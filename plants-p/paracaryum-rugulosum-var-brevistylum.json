    "intro": "Paracaryum rugulosum var. brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paracaryum, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
