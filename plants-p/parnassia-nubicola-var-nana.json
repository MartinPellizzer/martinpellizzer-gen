    "intro": "Parnassia nubicola var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf parnassia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often adorned with purple or red markings. The plant typically has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
