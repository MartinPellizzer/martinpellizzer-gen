    "intro": "Prunus avium f. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled peach, is a compact form of the domesticated peach. It is characterized by its shorter petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are typically less abundant than those of the standard peach variety. It is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. This form is well-suited for small gardens and container growing."
