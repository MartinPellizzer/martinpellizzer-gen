    "intro": "Polypodium munchii, commonly known as the Munch's cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Polypodium munchii is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
