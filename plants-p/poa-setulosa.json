    "intro": "Poa setulosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms dense, low-growing sods and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
