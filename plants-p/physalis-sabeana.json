It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red berries enclosed in a papery calyx. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The berries are edible when ripe and are valued for their sweet-tart flavor and ornamental appeal."
