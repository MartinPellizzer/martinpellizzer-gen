    "intro": "Pogonia lessonii var. skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly faces, which give it its common name. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, it thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and is known for its delicate, showy blooms that appear in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
