    "intro": "Paronychia galatica, commonly known as the Galician sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime climates. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Paronychia galatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
