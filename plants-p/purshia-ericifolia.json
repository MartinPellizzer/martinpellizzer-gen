    "intro": "Purshia ericifolia, commonly known as the mountain sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Purshia ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
