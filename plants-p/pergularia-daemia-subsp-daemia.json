It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
