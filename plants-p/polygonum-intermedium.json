    "intro": "Polygonum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is part of the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stems. Polygonum intermedium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
