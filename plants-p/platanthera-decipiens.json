It is a perennial herb with a tall, leafless stem that bears showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee, aiding in pollination. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
