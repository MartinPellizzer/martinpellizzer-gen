    "intro": "Pieris esquirolii var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with white or cream-colored veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, elliptical berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, though it may be susceptible to pests and diseases in certain conditions."
