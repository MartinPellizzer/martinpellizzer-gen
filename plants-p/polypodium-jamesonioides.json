    "intro": "Polypodium jamesonioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium jamesonioides is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
