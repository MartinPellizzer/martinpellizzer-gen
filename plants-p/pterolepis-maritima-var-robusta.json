    "intro": "Pterolepis maritima var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing along rocky shores and dunes. Its succulent structure helps it retain water in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
