    "intro": "Pneumatopteris sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are divided into small, lance-shaped segments that help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis. Pneumatopteris sumbawensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
