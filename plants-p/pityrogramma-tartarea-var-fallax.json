It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often display variegation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. The fronds are typically small, with a glossy surface and a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
