    "intro": "Protea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or greyish foliage and its large, showy flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Protea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
