    "intro": "Piptostigma fugax, commonly known as the ghost tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a distinctive, aromatic scent. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
