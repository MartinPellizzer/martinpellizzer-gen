    "intro": "Potentilla recta subsp. asturica, commonly known as the Asturian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and its stems are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and compact growth habit."
