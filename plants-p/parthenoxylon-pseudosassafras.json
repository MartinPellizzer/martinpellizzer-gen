    "intro": "Parthenoxylon pseudosassafras, commonly known as the false sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and camphor. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted and emit a strong, spicy scent. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the spring, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. The bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though its use is less common today."
