It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, still water environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, oxygenated water conditions."
