    "intro": "Pilosella calodon subsp. sphaleron, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and size. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads."
