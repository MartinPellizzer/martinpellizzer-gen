    "intro": "Pipturus argenteus var. argenteus, commonly known as silverleaf mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and adaptability to various light conditions."
