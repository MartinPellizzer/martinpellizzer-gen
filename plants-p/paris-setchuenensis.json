    "intro": "Paris setchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan Paris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
