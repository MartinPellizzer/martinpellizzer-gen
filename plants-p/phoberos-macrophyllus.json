    "intro": "Phoberos macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Davalliaceae family, characterized by its large, leathery fronds. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, featuring a distinctive bipinnate structure with elongated pinnae. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are arranged in clusters along the underside of the fronds. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
