    "intro": "Pavetta humilis, commonly known as the small pavetta, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically features simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, often with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in cymes. These flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that contain several elliptical seeds. Pavetta humilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas."
