    "intro": "Polypodium exiguum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. Polypodium exiguum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
