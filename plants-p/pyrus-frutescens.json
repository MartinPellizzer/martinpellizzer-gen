    "intro": "Pyrus frutescens, commonly known as the sand pear, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
