It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Penaea affinis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
