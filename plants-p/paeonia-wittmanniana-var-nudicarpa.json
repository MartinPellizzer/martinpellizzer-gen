    "intro": "Paeonia wittmanniana var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed peony, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically appearing in late spring. The plant features compound leaves with a serrated margin and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil. Its unique feature is the absence of a fleshy fruit, as the seeds are exposed and not enclosed in a capsule. This variety is valued for its horticultural beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
