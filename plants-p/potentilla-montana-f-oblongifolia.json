    "intro": "Potentilla montana f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, oblong leaves, which set it apart from other forms of Potentilla montana."
