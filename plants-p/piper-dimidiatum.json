It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, peppery fruits. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental plant, often cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
