    "intro": "Pachypleuria repens, commonly known as the creeping pachypleura, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, succulent stems that allow it to store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pachypleuria repens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
