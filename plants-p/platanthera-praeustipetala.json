    "intro": "Platanthera praeustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
