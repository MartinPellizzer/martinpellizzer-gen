    "intro": "Penstemon ambiguus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers, usually in shades of pink, purple, or white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon ambiguus is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
