    "intro": "Paepalanthus villosulus, commonly known as the woolly puya, is a striking South American plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andes, where it thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. Its flowers, which are typically bright red or orange, are clustered in a spiky inflorescence. Paepalanthus villosulus is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established."
