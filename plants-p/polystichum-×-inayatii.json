    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 inayatii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum polystichum. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically glossy and have a dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are often divided into multiple segments with a zigzag pattern along the midrib. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal."
