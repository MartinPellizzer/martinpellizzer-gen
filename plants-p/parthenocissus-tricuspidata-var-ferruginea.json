    "intro": "Parthenocissus tricuspidata var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ivy or red-leaf Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in autumn, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its vigorous growth habit makes it popular for covering walls and trellises in ornamental landscaping. The foliage turns vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and urban environments."
