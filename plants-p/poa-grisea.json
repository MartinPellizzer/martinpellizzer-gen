    "intro": "Poa grisea, commonly known as grey hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that give it its common name, and it often grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Poa grisea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
