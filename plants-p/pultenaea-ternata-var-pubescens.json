    "intro": "Pultenaea ternata var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky pultenaea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance. The silky pultenaea is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
