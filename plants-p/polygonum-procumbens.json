    "intro": "Polygonum procumbens, commonly known as prostrate knotweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often spreading along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum procumbens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments."
