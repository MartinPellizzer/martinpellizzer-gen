    "intro": "Pitcairnia setipetiola, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy, and often velvety leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and store water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
