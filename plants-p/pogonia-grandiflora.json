    "intro": "Pogonia grandiflora, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
