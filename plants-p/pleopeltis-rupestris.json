    "intro": "Pleopeltis rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Pleopeltis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
