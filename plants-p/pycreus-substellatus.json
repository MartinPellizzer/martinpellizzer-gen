    "intro": "Pycreus substellatus, commonly known as the starry pycreus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus substellatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
