    "intro": "Plottzia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often blue or purple, bracts that surround the small flowers. These bracts are modified leaves that serve to protect the delicate inflorescences and enhance the plant's visual appeal. Plottzia species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. The genus includes several species, such as Plottzia corymbosa, which is native to southern Africa and the Mascarene Islands."
