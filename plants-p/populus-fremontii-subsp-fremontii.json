    "intro": "Populus fremontii subsp. fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in riparian zones along rivers and streams. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This subspecies is an important component of desert ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
