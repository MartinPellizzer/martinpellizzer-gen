    "intro": "Paspalum boscianum, commonly known as the Boscian grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in wetland environments and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions. Paspalum boscianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping and ecological gardens."
