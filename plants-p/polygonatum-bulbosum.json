    "intro": "Polygonatum bulbosum, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
