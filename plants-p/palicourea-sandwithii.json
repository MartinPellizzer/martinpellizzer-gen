    "intro": "Palicourea sandwithii, commonly known as Sandwith's palicourea, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in Jamaica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
