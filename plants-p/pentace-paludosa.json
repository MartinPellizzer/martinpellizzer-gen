    "intro": "Pentace paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pentace, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Pentace paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
