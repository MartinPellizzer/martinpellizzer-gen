    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles vapincensis, commonly known as the Vapincens cherry, is a rare and ancient variety of cherry native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that ripen in late summer, and its leaves are oval with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. It is noted for its ornamental value, with showy white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
