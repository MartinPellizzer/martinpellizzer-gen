    "intro": "Paspalum chilense, commonly known as Chilean paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum chilense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
