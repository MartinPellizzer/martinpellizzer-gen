    "intro": "Pterolepis heterostemon, commonly known as the spiral-flowered plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
