    "intro": "Pteridium brownseyi, commonly known as the Brownsey's bracken, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteridium brownseyi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
