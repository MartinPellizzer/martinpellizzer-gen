    "intro": "Phelipanche tricholoba, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually purple or blue in color, blooming in the morning. It is native to regions of Africa and the Mediterranean but has been introduced to other parts of the world. Phelipanche tricholoba is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
