    "intro": "Polycarpon peploides var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved sand mustard, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and rounded, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant typically grows low to the ground, forming dense mats that stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, coastal climates."
