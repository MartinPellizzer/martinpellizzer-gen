    "intro": "Polypodium acutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium acutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
