    "intro": "Pirea, commonly known as the water plantain, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Alismataceae. It typically features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Pirea species are valued for their ability to purify water and provide habitat for aquatic life. They are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
