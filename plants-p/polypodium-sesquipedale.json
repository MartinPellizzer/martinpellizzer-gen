    "intro": "Polypodium sesquipedale, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swamps. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange. The plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
