    "intro": "Parkinsonia \u00d7 sonorae, commonly known as the huajillo or desert\u597d\u5417, is a hybrid legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate and have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
