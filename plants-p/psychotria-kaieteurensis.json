It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. Psychotria kaieteurensis is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
