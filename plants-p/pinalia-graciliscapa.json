    "intro": "Pinalia graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pinalia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it blooms during the cooler months. Pinalia graciliscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
