    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta, commonly known as common bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist habitats. Polygonum bistorta is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partially shaded conditions."
