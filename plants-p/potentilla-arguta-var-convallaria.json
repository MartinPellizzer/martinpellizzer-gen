    "intro": "Potentilla arguta var. convallaria, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in landscaped areas."
