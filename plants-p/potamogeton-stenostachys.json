    "intro": "Potamogeton stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
