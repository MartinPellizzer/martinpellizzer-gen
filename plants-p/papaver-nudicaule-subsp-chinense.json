    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule subsp. chinense, commonly known as the Chinese poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, with a distinctive saucer-like structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its seeds are small and contain alkaloids, making it both botanically interesting and potentially toxic."
