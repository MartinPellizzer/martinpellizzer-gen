    "intro": "Pedicularis clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it may obtain some of its nutrients from host plants. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
