    "intro": "Pleurothallis umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
