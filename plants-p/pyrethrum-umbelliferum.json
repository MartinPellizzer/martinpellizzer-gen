    "intro": "Pyrethrum umbelliferum, commonly known as the yellow pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pyrethrum umbelliferum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in natural pest control due to its insecticidal properties."
