    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius var. repens, commonly known as creeping ginseng, is a variant of the American ginseng plant. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit and distinctive palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, typical of the Araliaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is native to parts of North America. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is often protected or endangered in its natural habitat."
