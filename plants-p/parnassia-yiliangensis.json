It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white flowers with yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
