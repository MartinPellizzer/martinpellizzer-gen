    "intro": "Piptadenia mannii, commonly known as African locust bean, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for semi-arid regions. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
