    "intro": "Pleurostachys millegrana, commonly known as the golden beard grass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescence that resembles a beard, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a tufted cluster at the base, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Pleurostachys millegrana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
