    "intro": "Parrya nauruaq, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Parrya nauruaq plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
