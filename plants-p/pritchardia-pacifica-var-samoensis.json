    "intro": "Pritchardia pacifica var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the islands of Samoa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, stiff, dark green leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the male cones typically appearing first followed by the female cones. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a tropical climate with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
