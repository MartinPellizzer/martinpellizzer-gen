    "intro": "Potentilla erecta var. curiensis, commonly known as the Himalayan cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
