    "intro": "Pacoseroca, commonly known as the \"blue orchid of the Andes,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue petals, which are unique among orchids. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, adding a rare beauty to the Andean landscape. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, pacoseroca is considered a delicately endangered species."
