    "intro": "Platytaenia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir flatleaf, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and flat, often forming a rosette, and its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
