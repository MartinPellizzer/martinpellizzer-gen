    "intro": "Potentilla purpurascens var. pinetorum, commonly known as the redstem cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and distinctive red stems that contrast with its bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions."
