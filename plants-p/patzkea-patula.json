    "intro": "Patzkea patula, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it stay buoyant and supports its massive leaves. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Patzkea patula plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation."
