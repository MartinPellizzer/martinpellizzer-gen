    "intro": "Porrum descendens, commonly known as the descending gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces large, elongated fruits that hang downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and it has tendrils that aid in climbing. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family."
