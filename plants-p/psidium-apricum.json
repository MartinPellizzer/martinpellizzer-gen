    "intro": "Psidium apricum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or cherimoya, is a tropical plant belonging to the Sapotaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces a large, egg-shaped fruit with a thick, greenish-brown rind that turns yellow when ripe. The fruit's interior is creamy and contains a mix of seeds and edible pulp, known for its sweet, tropical flavor. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom before the fruit develops."
