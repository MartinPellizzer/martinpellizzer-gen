    "intro": "Paronychia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Paronychia paniculata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
