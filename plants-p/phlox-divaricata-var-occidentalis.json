    "intro": "Phlox divaricata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western blue phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense clusters of fragrant, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
