    "intro": "Pilea muscosa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosettes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to propagate through stem cuttings adds to its appeal as an easy-to-care-for houseplant."
