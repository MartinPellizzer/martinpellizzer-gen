    "intro": "Pimpinella magna var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with serrated leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
