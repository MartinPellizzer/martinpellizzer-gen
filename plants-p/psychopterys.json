    "intro": "Psychopterys, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Psychopterys species typically have smooth, waxy leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. These botanical features make Psychopterys an intriguing subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
