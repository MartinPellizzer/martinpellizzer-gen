    "intro": "Polypodium petrafolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance. Polypodium petrafolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
