    "intro": "Populus candicans, commonly known as the silver poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white, silky undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a fluted or ridged bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its flowers are small and appear in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Populus candicans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones along rivers and streams."
