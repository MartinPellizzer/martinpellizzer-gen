It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
