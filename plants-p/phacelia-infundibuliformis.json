    "intro": "Phacelia infundibuliformis, commonly known as the hooded phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its distinctive hood-like bracts give it its common name and aid in attracting pollinators. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
