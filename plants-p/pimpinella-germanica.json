    "intro": "Pimpinella germanica, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial or annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Pimpinella germanica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
