It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that lack petals. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
