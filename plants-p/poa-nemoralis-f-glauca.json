    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. glauca, commonly known as the bluish meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-green foliage, which is due to a waxy coating on the leaves. This form typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is a low-growing plant with slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
