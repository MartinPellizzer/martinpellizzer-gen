    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. recta, commonly known as the sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, tart cherries that are widely used in cooking, baking, and as a fruit for ornamental purposes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. Its flowers are white to pink, appearing in clusters, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit ripens in late summer, typically turning a deep red or black depending on the variety."
