    "intro": "Pandanus validus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette around the base. The plant produces a distinctive, bottle-shaped inflorescence that resembles a brush, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are followed by a spiky, fibrous fruit. Pandanus validus is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens."
