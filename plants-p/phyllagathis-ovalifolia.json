    "intro": "Phyllagathis ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating the plant's propagation."
