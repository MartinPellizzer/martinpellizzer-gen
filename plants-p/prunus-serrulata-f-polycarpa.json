    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. polycarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited cherry, is a distinctive cultivar of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its ability to produce multiple fruits on a single stem, a trait that sets it apart from typical cherry species. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and unique fruiting characteristics."
