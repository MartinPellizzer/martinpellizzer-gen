    "intro": "Psiadia resiniflora, commonly known as the resinous psiadia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant is notable for its aromatic resinous secretions, which are released from specialized glandular structures on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture and can vary in color depending on environmental conditions. Psiadia resiniflora is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh climates through its drought-resistant features."
