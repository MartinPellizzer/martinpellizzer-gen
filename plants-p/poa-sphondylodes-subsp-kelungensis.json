    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes subsp. kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
