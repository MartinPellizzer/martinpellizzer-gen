    "intro": "Pauridiantha ziamaeana, commonly known as the Zimba tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats."
