It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, ovate leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both home and office environments."
