    "intro": "Pedicularis racemosa var. alba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical studies and conservation efforts."
