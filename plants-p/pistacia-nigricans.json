    "intro": "Pistacia nigricans, commonly known as the black pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its hard, woody fruit, which contains a single seed enclosed in a thick, leathery husk. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
