It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa jubata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
