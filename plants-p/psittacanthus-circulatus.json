    "intro": "Psittacanthus circulatus, commonly known as the circular cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare plants."
