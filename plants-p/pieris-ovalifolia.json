    "intro": "Pieris ovalifolia, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and seasonal floral displays."
