It is a perennial herb with a slender, leafless stem that often grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. It lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for photosynthesis. This subspecies is found in temperate regions of North America and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
