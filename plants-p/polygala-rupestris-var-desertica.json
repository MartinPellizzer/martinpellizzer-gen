    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. desertica, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and slender, often spiny stems. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
