    "intro": "Petrocoptis grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflorous rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Petrocoptis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
