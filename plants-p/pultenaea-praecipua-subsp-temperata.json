    "intro": "Pultenaea praecipua subsp. temperata, commonly known as the slender pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
