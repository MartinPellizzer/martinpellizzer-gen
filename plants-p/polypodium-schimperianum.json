    "intro": "Polypodium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Polypodium schimperianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
