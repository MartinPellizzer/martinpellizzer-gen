It features a short, unbranched stem with a dense cluster of stiff, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
