    "intro": "Pilosella occidentalis, commonly known as the western pearly everlet, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while the flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often forming a daisy-like arrangement. Pilosella occidentalis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
