    "intro": "Procris acaulis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss through transpiration. Procris acaulis is often found in alpine and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
