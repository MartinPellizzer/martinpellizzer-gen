    "intro": "Polypodium conjunctum, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a clustered pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new shoots. Its spores are released from small, round sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium conjunctum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests."
