It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
