It is a deciduous shrub that typically reaches heights of 2 to 4 meters, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, double flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. The fruit, known as a drupe, is small, dark blue, and contains a single seed. This variety is often cultivated for its showy floral display and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
