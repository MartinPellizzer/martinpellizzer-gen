    "intro": "Passiflora manicata var. communis, commonly known as the common passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with intricate filaments and a crown-like structure. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
