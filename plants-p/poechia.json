    "intro": "Poechia, commonly known as the \"rock parsley,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are characterized by their slender stems and fern-like, compound leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Poechia species are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and hardiness."
