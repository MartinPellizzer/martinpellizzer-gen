    "intro": "Pyrethrum filipendulinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable plant in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking eco-friendly alternatives to chemical pesticides."
