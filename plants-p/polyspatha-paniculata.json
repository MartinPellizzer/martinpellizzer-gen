It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind. Polyspatha paniculata plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
