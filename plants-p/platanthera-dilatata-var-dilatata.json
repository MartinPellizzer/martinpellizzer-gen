    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that bear a dense spike of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral along the stem. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
