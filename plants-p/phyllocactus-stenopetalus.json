    "intro": "Phyllocactus stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled phyllocactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
