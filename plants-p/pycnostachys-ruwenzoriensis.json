    "intro": "Pycnostachys ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are adapted to its unique blooming cycle. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
