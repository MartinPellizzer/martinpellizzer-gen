    "intro": "Philodendron petraeum var. triangulare, commonly known as the Triangular Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often a vibrant green with a slight variegation. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves. The varietal name \"triangulare\" refers to the distinctive triangular shape of its leaves."
