    "intro": "Piptadenia stenadenia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cordia* tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
