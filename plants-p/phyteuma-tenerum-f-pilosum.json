It is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Native to southern Europe, this perennial plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
