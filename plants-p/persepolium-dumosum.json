    "intro": "Persepolium dumosum, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Persepolium dumosum is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
