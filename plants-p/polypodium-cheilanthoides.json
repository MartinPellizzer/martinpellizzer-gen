    "intro": "Polypodium cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dry, sunny habitats such as crevices and slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium cheilanthoides is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
