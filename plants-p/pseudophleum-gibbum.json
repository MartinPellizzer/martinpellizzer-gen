    "intro": "Pseudophleum gibbum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Pseudophleum gibbum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
