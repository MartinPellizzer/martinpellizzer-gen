    "intro": "Prunus arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian cherry, is a rare and ancient species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in traditional craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
