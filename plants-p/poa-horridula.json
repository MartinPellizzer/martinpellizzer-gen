    "intro": "Poa horridula, commonly known as the bristly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, Poa horridula is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
