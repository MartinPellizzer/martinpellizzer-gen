    "intro": "Polystichum pseudodeltodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and forms dense, compact clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum pseudodeltodon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
