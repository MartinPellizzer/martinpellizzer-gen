    "intro": "Pellaea pallida, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pellaea pallida thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a distinctive member of the fern family."
