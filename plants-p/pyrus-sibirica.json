    "intro": "Pyrus sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the forests of eastern Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green on top, and pale underneath, with a serrated margin. Pyrus sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability to cold climates."
