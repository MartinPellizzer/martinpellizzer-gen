    "intro": "Phyllarthron antongiliense, commonly known as the Antongili fern, is a rare and unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense mats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
