    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus var. coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare variant of the Mexican pine native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard species. The cones of this variety are relatively small and often have a distinctive reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
