    "intro": "Parmentiera trunciflora, commonly known as the Mexican trumpet vine, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
