    "intro": "Pleopeltis whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with serrated or lobed margins. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
