    "intro": "Pimpinella betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are palmately lobed, resembling the leaves of birch trees, hence its common name. The flowers are small and white, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
