    "intro": "Peniocereus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan night bloomer, is a cactus native to Central America. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
