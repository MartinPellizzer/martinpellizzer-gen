    "intro": "Phragmanthera baumii, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers during the dry season, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and vivid floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
