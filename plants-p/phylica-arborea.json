    "intro": "Phylica arborea, commonly known as the silver tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and produces small, red or yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to 10 meters tall, forming a broad, rounded canopy. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The silver tree is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
