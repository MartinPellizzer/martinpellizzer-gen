    "intro": "Poecilolepis, commonly known as the \"honeycomb plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems that resemble a honeycomb structure, which provides structural support and aids in water retention. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Poecilolepis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their distinctive appearance."
