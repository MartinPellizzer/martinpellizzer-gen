It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant form and seasonal interest. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in temperate climates."
