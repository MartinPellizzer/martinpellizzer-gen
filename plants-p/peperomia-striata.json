    "intro": "Peperomia striata, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy, dark green leaves with prominent, wavy margins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique leaf patterns make it a popular choice for decorative purposes in both home and office settings."
