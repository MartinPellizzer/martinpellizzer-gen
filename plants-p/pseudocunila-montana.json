It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pseudocunila montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
