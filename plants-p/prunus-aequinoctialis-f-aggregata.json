It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the formation of multiple stems from a single root system. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and compact form. This form is prized in horticulture for its unique structure and seasonal display."
