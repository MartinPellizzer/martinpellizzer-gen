    "intro": "Picrella glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular picrella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in deterring herbivores or facilitating moisture retention."
