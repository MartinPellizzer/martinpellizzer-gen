It is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its hairy, glandular stems. The plant grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or moist environments. It is part of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
