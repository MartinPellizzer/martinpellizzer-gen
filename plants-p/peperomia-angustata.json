    "intro": "Peperomia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems covered with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Peperomia angustata thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
