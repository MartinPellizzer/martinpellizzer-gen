    "intro": "Parosela sulfurea, commonly known as the sulfur yellow orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinct sulfur-yellow hue. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Parosela sulfurea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique coloration."
