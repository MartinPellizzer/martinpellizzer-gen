    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan roundleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Tibet. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are round or slightly ovate in shape, with a dense, hairy covering that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure known as a cyme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
