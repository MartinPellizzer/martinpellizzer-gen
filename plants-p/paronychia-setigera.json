It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is native to the western United States and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its sticky sap and toxic berries, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
