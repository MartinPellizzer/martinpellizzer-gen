    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. rosenthalii, commonly known as the Rosenthal's sycamore, is a variant of the oriental plane tree. It is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern of white, green, and brown. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a pointed tip. It produces spherical clusters of small, pale green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. This tree is often found in urban environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
