It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many diverse plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
