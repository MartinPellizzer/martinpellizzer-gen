    "intro": "Pabstiella naimekei, commonly known as the Hawaiian starflower, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pabstiella naimekei is considered a vulnerable species."
