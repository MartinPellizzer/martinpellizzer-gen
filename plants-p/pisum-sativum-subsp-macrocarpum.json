    "intro": "Pisum sativum subsp. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded pea, is a subspecies of the pea plant characterized by its larger, more robust seeds compared to typical garden peas. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces climbing vines with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its seeds are often used in culinary applications, similar to other pea varieties, and are valued for their nutritional content. This subspecies is also cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
