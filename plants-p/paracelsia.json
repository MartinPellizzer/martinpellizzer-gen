    "intro": "Paracelsia, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spine-like structures along the stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The leaves are usually deeply lobed and can vary in shape depending on the species. Paracelsia plants are typically climbing or trailing vines that produce small, yellowish flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value."
