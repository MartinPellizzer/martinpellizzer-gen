    "intro": "Pteris chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a low-growing mat, often found in rocky or shaded habitats. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, narrow shape and a dark green color. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in sori. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
