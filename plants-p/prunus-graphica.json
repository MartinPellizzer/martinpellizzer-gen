    "intro": "Prunus graphica, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of different colors, ranging from gray to red. The tree produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy upper surface with a matte underside. Prunus graphica is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along the Pacific coast."
