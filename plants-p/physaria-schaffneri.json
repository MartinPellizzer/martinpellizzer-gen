    "intro": "Physaria schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are alternate, oblanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are succulent and often branched. Its fruit is a segmented capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Physaria schaffneri thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments."
