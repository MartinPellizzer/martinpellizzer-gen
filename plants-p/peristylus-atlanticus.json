    "intro": "Peristylus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic peristylus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty air and wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
