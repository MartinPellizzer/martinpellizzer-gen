    "intro": "Polystichum dangii, commonly known as the Dang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum dangii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
