    "intro": "Phalaris quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Phalaris quadrivalvis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
