    "intro": "Ptychosperma puniceum, commonly known as the red-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red foliage that contrasts with its dark, rugged trunk. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its leaves are pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces cones rather than flowers. Ptychosperma puniceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
