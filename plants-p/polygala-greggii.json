    "intro": "Polygala greggii, commonly known as Gregg's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers, which are often pink or purple, are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
