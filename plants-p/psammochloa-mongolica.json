    "intro": "Psammochloa mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and northern China. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions with low precipitation. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Psammochloa mongolica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
