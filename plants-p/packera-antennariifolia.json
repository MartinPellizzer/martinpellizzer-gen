    "intro": "Packera antennariifolia, commonly known as the Alpine golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. Packera antennariifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
