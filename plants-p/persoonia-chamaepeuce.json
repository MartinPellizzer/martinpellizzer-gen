    "intro": "Persoonia chamaepeuce, commonly known as the coastal wallaby bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of south-eastern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that release seeds when mature. Persoonia chamaepeuce is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
