    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. typica, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree, is a cultivar of the Prunus serrulata species, native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in late March to early April. The tree has a rounded, often weeping habit with slender branches and small, oval leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is a symbol of renewal and the transient nature of life in Japanese culture. This cultivar is often planted in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal display."
