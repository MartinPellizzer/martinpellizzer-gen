    "intro": "Pleomele camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Cameroon. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
