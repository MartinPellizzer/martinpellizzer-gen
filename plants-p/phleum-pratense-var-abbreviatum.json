    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed timothy grass, is a variant of timothy grass characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is valued for its use in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
