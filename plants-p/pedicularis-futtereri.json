    "intro": "Pedicularis futtereri, commonly known as the Futterer's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, Pedicularis futtereri is relatively rare and often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
