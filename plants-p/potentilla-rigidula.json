    "intro": "Potentilla rigidula, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Potentilla rigidula is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
