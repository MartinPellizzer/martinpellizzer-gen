    "intro": "Pocockia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit, with closely packed, orbicular (circle-shaped) leaves that form a dense mat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its simple, undivided leaves are usually less than 1 cm in diameter and have a smooth, glossy surface. Pocockia orbicularis is an important component of microhabitats in temperate and subtropical regions, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
