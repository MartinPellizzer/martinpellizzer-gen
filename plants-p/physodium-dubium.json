    "intro": "Physodium dubium, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, often saturated soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Physodium dubium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting pollinator populations."
