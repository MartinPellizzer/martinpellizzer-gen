    "intro": "Pteracanthus guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi pteracanthus, is a rare fern native to the Guangxi region of China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in the understory where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteracanthus guangxiensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
