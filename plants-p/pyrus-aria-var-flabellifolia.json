    "intro": "Pyrus aria var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the Flabellifoliate Pear, is a rare and ornamental variant of the pear tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that give it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in late summer. It is typically found in temperate regions with well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its horticultural interest."
