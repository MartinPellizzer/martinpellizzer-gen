    "intro": "Padus obovata, commonly known as the whitehorn or oval-leaf bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. Padus obovata is often found in woodland edges and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
