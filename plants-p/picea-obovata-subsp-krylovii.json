    "intro": "Picea obovata subsp. krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The cones are typically pendulous and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
