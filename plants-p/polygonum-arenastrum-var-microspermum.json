    "intro": "Polygonum arenastrum var. microspermum, commonly known as the desert knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or red. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
