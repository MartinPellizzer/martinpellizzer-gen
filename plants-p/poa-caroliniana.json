    "intro": "Poa caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive sods. Poa caroliniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its visual texture and resilience."
