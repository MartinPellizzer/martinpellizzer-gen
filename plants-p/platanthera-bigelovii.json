    "intro": "Platanthera bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose, hairy spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a cool, humid environment. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, black seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
