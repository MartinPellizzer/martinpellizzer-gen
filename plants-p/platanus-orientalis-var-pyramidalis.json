    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Oriental Plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its distinctive, rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for urban landscapes. Its pyramidal shape and ornamental value make it a notable specimen in botanical gardens and parks."
