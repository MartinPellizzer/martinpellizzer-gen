    "intro": "Panax glabratus, commonly known as the smooth ginseng, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy roots. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its medicinal properties, it is highly valued in traditional medicine, though it is less well-known than Panax ginseng."
