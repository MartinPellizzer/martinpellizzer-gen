    "intro": "Potentilla pseudo-obscura, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla pseudo-obscura is adapted to cold, rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
