    "intro": "Pterocaulon globuliforus, commonly known as the globular candelabra cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a crown of short, cylindrical stems that resemble a candelabra. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
