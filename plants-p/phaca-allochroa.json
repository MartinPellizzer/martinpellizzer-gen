    "intro": "Phaca allochroa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Phaca allochroa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
