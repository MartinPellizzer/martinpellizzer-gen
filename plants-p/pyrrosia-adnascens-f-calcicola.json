    "intro": "Pyrrosia adnascens f. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola fern, is a rare variant of the Pyrrosia adnascens species. It is a terrestrial fern typically found in rocky or calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"calcicola,\" meaning \"dwellers of calcium.\" The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats."
