It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
