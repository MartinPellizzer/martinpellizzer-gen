    "intro": "Paris polyphylla var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Indian fern, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, fern-like crown. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
