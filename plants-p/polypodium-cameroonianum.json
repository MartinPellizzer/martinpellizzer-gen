    "intro": "Polypodium cameroonianum, commonly known as the Cameroon fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium cameroonianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
