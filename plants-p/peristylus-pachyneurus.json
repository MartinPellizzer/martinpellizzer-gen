It is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glandular surface that produces a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
