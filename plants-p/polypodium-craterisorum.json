    "intro": "Polypodium craterisorum, commonly known as the crater shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually pinnate, with a strong central vein and small, rounded pinnae. Polypodium craterisorum is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to challenging substrates."
