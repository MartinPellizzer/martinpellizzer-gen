    "intro": "Prunus aequinoctialis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a soft, cascading appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its foliage turns a vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
