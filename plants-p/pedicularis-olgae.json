    "intro": "Pedicularis olgae, commonly known as the Alpine Monkeyflower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are parasitic, drawing nutrients from the roots of other plants, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Pedicularis. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
