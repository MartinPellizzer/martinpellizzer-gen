    "intro": "Potentilla longifrons, commonly known as the long-fruited cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring multiple stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges, and the fruits are small, woody capsules that mature in the fall. Potentilla longifrons is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
