    "intro": "Phenax stocksii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the brief summer months in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in the harsh, cold environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Phenax stocksii is considered a rare and endangered species."
