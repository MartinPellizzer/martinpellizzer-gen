It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Navajo beardtongue is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies."
