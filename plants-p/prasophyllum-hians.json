It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, narrow spike of white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often clustered at the base. Prasophyllum hians is adapted to cool, moist conditions and is often found in areas with well-drained soils."
