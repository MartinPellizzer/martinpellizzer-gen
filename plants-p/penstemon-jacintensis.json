    "intro": "Penstemon jacintensis, commonly known as the purple penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to lavender. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon jacintensis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
