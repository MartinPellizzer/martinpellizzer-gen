    "intro": "Potamogeton panormitanus var. major, commonly known as the Greater Pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in clusters near the water's surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its ecosystem."
