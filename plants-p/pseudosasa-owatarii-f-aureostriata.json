    "intro": "Pseudosasa owatarii f. aureostriata, commonly known as the golden-striped bamboo, is a compact, ornamental bamboo species native to Japan. It features striking golden-yellow stripes on its slender, gracefully arching stems, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant grows in clumps and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by edible, nut-like seeds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in garden design for its elegant, upright growth habit."
