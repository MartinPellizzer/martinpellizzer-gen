    "intro": "Polygala pseudocoelosioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
