It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
