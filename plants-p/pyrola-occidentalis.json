    "intro": "Pyrola occidentalis, commonly known as the western pinkroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils found in forest understories. Pyrola occidentalis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small forest-dwelling organisms."
