    "intro": "Pyrus anlungensis, commonly known as the Anlung pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in the autumn. It is often found in moist, temperate forests and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Pyrus."
