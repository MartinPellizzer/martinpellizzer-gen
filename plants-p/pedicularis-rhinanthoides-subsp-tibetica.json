    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides subsp. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects. It is valued for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
