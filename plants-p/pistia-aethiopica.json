    "intro": "Pistia aethiopica, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are anchored in the water, and it spreads primarily through vegetative reproduction. Pistia aethiopica is often found in slow-moving freshwater bodies and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
