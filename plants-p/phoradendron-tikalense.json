    "intro": "Phoradendron tikalense, commonly known as the Tikal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical regions. It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and has a distinctive appearance with smooth, dark green leaves and small, white flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesizing to produce its own food. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for various bird species. The species is found primarily in Central America, including countries like Guatemala and Belize."
