    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides var. monophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf number and elongated flowering stems compared to other members of the species."
