    "intro": "Polygala parryi, commonly known as the Parry's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Polygala parryi is often found in desert ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
