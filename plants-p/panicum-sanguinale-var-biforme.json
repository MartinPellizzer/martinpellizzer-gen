    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. biforme, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, reddish-bracted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
