    "intro": "Polypodium pyxidiforme, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which are typically leathery and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium pyxidiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
