    "intro": "Phyllanthus nutans var. genuinus, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features prostrate growth habit with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
