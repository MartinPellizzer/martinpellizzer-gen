    "intro": "Paris violacea, commonly known as the purple lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, dark green stems and dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found growing in clusters along the ground. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
