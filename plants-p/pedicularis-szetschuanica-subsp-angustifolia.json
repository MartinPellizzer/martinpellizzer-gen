    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with distinctive yellow markings. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
