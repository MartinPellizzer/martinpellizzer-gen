    "intro": "Polypodium muscoides, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks, forming dense, mat-like colonies that resemble moss. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and covered in fine, root-like structures that help anchor it to its substrate. Polypodium muscoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of tropical forests."
