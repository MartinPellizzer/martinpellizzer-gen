    "intro": "Prunus napaulensis var. sericea, commonly known as the silky chinaberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its silvery pubescent leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in ecological restoration projects."
