    "intro": "Pseudo-oenothera, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. They are native to North America and are typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Pseudo-oenothera species are herbaceous, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant's reproductive strategy involves attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles through its night-blooming flowers."
