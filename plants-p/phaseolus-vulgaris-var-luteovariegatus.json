    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. luteovariegatus, commonly known as the yellow variegated bean, is a variant of the common bean species characterized by its unique leaf and stem coloration. Its leaves exhibit a striking yellow and green variegation pattern, which is a result of genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. This plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and well-drained soil, often cultivated for its ornamental value and, in some cases, for its edible beans. The variegation makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking visually appealing plants."
