    "intro": "Polypodiopsis muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's polypodiopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
