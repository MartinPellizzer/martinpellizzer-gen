    "intro": "Pleopeltis fallax, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. It typically grows on shaded rock faces or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleopeltis fallax is considered a rare and endangered species."
