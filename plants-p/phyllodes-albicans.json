    "intro": "Phyllodes albicans, commonly known as the white-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spikes and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Phyllodes albicans is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as reduced leaf surface area."
