It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that clasping the stem, giving it its species name \"amplexicaulis.\" The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats."
