It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
