    "intro": "Pitcairnia grafii, commonly known as the glassy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glassy coating. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia grafii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
