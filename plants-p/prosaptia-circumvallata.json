    "intro": "Prosaptia circumvallata, commonly known as the spiral-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its intricate, spiraling leaf venation pattern, which is unique to its genus. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, Prosaptia circumvallata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
