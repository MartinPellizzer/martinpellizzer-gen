It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, arid environments."
