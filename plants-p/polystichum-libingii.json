    "intro": "Polystichum libingii, commonly known as the Libing's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum libingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
