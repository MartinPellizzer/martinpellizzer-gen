    "intro": "Pedicularis palustris subsp. opsiantha, commonly known as the marsh monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of western North America. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink to red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora in its native habitat."
