    "intro": "Padus serotina var. salicifolia, commonly known as the white willow-leaf bird cherry, is a variant of the bird cherry species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The leaves are lanceolate and have a willow-like appearance, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer, providing food for various birds and small mammals."
