    "intro": "Poa annua var. caespitosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense sod. Botanically, it is distinguished by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth, allowing it to spread and establish quickly."
