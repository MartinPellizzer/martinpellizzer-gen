    "intro": "Primula deuteronana, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact rosettes of broad, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
