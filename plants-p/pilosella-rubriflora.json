    "intro": "Pilosella rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features dense, grayish-white fuzzy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are showy, with bright red petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella rubriflora is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions."
