It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescence that turns reddish-brown in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie ecosystems. It is drought-tolerant and often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The variety var. minus is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Panicum hirticaule."
