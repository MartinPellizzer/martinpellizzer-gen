    "intro": "Polygala thea, commonly known as the sacred candle or the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its striking, often pale or white, spire-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species well adapted to arid environments. Its unique floral structure is believed to mimic the appearance of small candles, hence its common name. Polygala thea is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
