    "intro": "Panicum lachnophyllum var. tropicum, commonly known as tropical hairgrass, is a grass species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, hairy texture and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
