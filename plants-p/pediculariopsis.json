    "intro": "Pediculariopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oronoideae subfamily within the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of pine forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, Pediculariopsis is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
