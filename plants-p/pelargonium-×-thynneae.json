    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 thynneae, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from several species of geraniums. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its compact growth and attractive appearance. Pelargonium \u00d7 thynneae is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate sunlight."
