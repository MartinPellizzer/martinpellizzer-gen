It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and feathery plumes. The plant is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and rough, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant's name \"pruriens\" refers to its ability to cause itching, a property associated with certain compounds found in its seeds."
