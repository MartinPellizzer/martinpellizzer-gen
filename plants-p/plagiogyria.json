    "intro": "Plagiogyria, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and are often seen in alpine or arctic regions. Plagiogyria species are generally perennial and have a compact growth habit. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
