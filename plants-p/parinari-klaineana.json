    "intro": "Parinari klaineana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Parinari klaineana is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, and it also plays a role in local ecosystems as a habitat for various wildlife species."
