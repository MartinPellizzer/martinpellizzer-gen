    "intro": "Peucedanum pradeepianum, commonly known as the Pradeep's angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are white to pale green and attract various pollinators. The roots and seeds of Peucedanum pradeepianum are used in Ayurvedic medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
