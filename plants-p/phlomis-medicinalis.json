    "intro": "Phlomis medicinalis, commonly known as upright mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties."
