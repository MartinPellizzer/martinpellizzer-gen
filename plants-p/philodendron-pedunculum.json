    "intro": "Philodendron pedunculum, commonly known as the hanging philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and trail, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves."
