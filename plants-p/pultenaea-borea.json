    "intro": "Pultenaea borea, commonly known as the mountain pultenaea, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its flowers are typically visited by a variety of native bees and other pollinators. Pultenaea borea is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
