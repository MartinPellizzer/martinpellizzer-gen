    "intro": "Pandanus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that spiral around the stem, giving it a unique and distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the fruit is edible and used in local cuisines. The spiral pandanus thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and well-drained soils."
