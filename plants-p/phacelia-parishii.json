It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
