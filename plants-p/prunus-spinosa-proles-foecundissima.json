    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles foecundissima, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruit. Its leaves are oval and have a serrated edge, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant itself is generally toxic in its raw form."
