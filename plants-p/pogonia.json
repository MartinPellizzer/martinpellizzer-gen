    "intro": "Pogonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States and parts of Florida. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often growing directly into the bark of trees, making it an epiphyte. Pogonia lacks leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
