    "intro": "Potentilla amansiana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla amansiana is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
