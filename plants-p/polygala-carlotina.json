    "intro": "Polygala carlotina, commonly known as the Carlotina milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is often found in coastal and inland areas with limited moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
