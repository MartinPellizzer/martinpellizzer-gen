It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty and ability to bloom in early spring."
