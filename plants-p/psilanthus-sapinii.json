    "intro": "Psilanthus sapinii, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to rocky and arid environments. Psilanthus sapinii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
