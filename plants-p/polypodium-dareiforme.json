    "intro": "Polypodium dareiforme, commonly known as the Chinese cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
