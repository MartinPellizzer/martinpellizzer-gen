    "intro": "Paepalanthus fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a water-dwelling plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that remain just above the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating to prevent water loss. Paepalanthus fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
