It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or wet meadows. The plant features elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in loose inflorescences, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes. Pilorea graminifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
