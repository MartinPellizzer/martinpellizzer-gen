It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by hollow stems. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, panicled flowers that bloom in the summer. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in regions with temperate to subarctic conditions."
