    "intro": "Poa equitans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa equitans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management."
