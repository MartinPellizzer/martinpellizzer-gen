    "intro": "Pyrgus racemosa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Pyrgus racemosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies."
