    "intro": "Plectranthus denudatus, commonly known as the naked stem plectranthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to attract pollinators."
