It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
