    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. herniarioides, commonly known as the four-leafed knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with a fibrous root system and compact growth form."
