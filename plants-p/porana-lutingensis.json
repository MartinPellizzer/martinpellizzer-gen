    "intro": "Porana lutingensis, commonly known as the Lutingensis Porana, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial sunlight. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Porana lutingensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
