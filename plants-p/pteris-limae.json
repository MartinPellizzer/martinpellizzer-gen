    "intro": "Pteris limae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically slender and arching. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris limae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
