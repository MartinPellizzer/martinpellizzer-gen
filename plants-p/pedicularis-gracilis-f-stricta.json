    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis f. stricta, commonly known as the slender monkey orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
