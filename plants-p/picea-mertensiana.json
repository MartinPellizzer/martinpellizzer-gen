    "intro": "Picea mertensiana, commonly known as the Mertens' spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark blue-green needles that are arranged in pairs. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cold, harsh climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Picea mertensiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and subarctic wildlife."
