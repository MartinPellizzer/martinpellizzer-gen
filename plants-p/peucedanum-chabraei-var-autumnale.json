It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The roots of this plant are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
