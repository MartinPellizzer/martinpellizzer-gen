It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive tubular corolla. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
