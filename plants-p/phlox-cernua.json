    "intro": "Phlox cernua, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer. The plant has spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats and thrive in woodland or shaded areas. Its foliage consists of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Creeping phlox is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist, partially shaded environments."
