    "intro": "Phaius lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a spider in appearance, hence its common name. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces a distinctive, intricate flower with a greenish-yellow lip and prominent calli. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phaius lyonii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
