    "intro": "Psilactis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are broad and often lobed, and they produce clusters of small, greenish or white flowers. They are adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Some species of Psilactis are used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful handling."
