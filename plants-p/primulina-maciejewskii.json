    "intro": "Primulina maciejewskii, commonly known as the Maciejewski's primulina, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the understorey of forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
