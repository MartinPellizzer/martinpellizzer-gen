    "intro": "Pulicaria crispa, commonly known as the woolly tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with a compact, mat-forming habit, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant features silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
