It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
