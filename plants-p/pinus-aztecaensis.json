    "intro": "Pinus aztecaensis, commonly known as the Aztec pine, is a species of conifer native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically bundled in pairs. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its wood is lightweight and has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for construction and crafting. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for various species."
