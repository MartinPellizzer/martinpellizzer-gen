    "intro": "Puccinellia \u00d7 pseudoprocumbens, commonly known as the hybrid glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and alkaline environments. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often prostrate growth habit. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and bluish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting specialized ecosystems."
