    "intro": "Psittacanthus warmingii, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lush, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that resemble stars. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a dense arrangement of small, pointed leaflets. Psittacanthus warmingii thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
