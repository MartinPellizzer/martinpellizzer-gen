    "intro": "Poivrea afzelii, commonly known as the Afzelius rose or Afzelius honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching branches with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Poivrea afzelii is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
