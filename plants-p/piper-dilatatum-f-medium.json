It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine."
