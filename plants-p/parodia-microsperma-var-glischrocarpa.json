    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. glischrocarpa, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to southern Africa. It features a ribbed, spiny stem with a distinctive golden-green coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
