    "intro": "Pandorea australis var. rosea, commonly known as the pink honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose hues. The plant produces small, yellow, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to autumn."
