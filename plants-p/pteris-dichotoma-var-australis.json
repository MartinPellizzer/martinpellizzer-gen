    "intro": "Pteris dichotoma var. australis, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
