    "intro": "Platanthera michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. It blooms in late summer, producing a fragrant, delicate floral display. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
