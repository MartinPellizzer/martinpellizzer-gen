    "intro": "Pigea serrata, commonly known as the serrated pigeonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits containing several seeds. Pigea serrata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
