    "intro": "Psilurus nardoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf psilurus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively rough texture, and its small white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
