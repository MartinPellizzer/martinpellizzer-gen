    "intro": "Parathesis corymbosa, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a vigorous trailing plant native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, tuberous roots. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its roots. Due to its rapid growth, it is frequently used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
