    "intro": "Psoralea obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Psoralea obovata is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in indigenous healing practices."
