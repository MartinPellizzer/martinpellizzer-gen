    "intro": "Parinari hypochrysea, commonly known as the yellow-leaf parinari, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with white or pale yellow petals, and the fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has limited economic importance but is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
