    "intro": "Piper terryae, commonly known as Terry's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to the Piper genus, which includes many economically important spices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
