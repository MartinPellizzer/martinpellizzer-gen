    "intro": "Panicum subuniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing a single floret, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
