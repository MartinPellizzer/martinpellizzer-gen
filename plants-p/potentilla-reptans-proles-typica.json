    "intro": "Potentilla reptans proles typica, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to June. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a common sight in meadows and woodland edges."
