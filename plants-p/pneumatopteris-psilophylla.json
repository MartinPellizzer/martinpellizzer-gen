    "intro": "Pneumatopteris psilophylla, commonly known as the water fern, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of modern ferns, though it is more closely related to the ancient group of plants known as psilophytes. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Pneumatopteris psilophylla is an important fossil plant, providing insights into the early evolution of vascular plant structures."
