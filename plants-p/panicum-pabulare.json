It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and golden-yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum pabulare is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
