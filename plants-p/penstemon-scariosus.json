It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Penstemon scariosus is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
