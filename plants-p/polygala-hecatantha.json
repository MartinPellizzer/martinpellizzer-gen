    "intro": "Polygala hecatantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with white, tubular flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, primarily flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
