It features striking, papery flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its capsules produce numerous small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
