    "intro": "Potentilla cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Potentilla cascadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
