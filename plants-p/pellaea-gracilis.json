    "intro": "Pellaea gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
