    "intro": "Polypodium cambricum subsp. macaronesicum, commonly known as the Macaronesian wall fern, is a fern species native to the Canary Islands and Madeira. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in its habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
