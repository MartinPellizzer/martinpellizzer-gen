    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria reflexiaristata, commonly known as the reflexed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often reflexed at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage grass or used in ecological restoration projects."
