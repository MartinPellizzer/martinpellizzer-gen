    "intro": "Placus odoratus, commonly known as the fragrant marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to ecosystem health. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in regions with high humidity and poor soil drainage."
