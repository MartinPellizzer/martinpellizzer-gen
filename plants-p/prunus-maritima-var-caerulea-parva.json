    "intro": "Prunus maritima var. caerulea-parva, commonly known as the dwarf sandcherry, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its compact form, with small, lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
