    "intro": "Phlebodium aureum var. trilobatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its rhizomes form a dense, root-like structure that anchors it to trees or rocks, allowing it to grow without soil. The golden staghorn fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
