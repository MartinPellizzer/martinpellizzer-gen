    "intro": "Perezia multiflora subsp. sonchifolia, commonly known as the Sonchifolia Perezia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial, with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
