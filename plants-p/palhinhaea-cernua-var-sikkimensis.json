    "intro": "Palhinhaea cernua var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Himalayan region. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and its potential use in horticulture."
