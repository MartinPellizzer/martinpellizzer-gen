    "intro": "Phymatopsis tenuipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
