    "intro": "Physaria utahensis, commonly known as the Utah bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a low, spreading growth habit and produces numerous small, rounded seed pods that burst open when mature. Physaria utahensis is often found in desert and semi-desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
