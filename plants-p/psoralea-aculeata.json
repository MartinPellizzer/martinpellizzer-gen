    "intro": "Psoralea aculeata, commonly known as the prickly psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. Its small, hairy leaves and spiny stems help it to retain moisture and deter herbivores. Psoralea aculeata is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating skin conditions."
