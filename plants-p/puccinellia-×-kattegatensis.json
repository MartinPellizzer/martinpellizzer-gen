    "intro": "Puccinellia \u00d7 kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat grass, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed florets, typical of many grass species. It is typically found in coastal or saline environments, showing some degree of salt tolerance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
