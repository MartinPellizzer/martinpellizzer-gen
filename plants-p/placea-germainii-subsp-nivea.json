    "intro": "Placea germainii subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered Placea, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive silvery underside that gives it a shimmering appearance. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
