    "intro": "Pycnopteris, commonly known as the dense fern or rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their tightly packed, often leathery fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Pycnopteris species are known for their rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, compact appearance that gives the genus its common name. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, rocky conditions."
