It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its spores are dispersed through the air, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The botanical study of this species provides insights into the evolution and adaptation of ferns in diverse ecosystems."
