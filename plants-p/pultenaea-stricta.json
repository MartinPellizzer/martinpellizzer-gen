It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a leathery texture, adapted to the dry conditions of its native habitat. Pultenaea stricta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
