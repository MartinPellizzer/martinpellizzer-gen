    "intro": "Pfeiffera boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian pfeiffera, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and woody stems. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, producing clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pfeiffera boliviana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat degradation."
