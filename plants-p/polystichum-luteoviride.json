    "intro": "Polystichum luteoviride, commonly known as the yellow-green wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often curled and clustered. The yellow-green wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
