    "intro": "Phelypaea tournefortii, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert landscapes."
