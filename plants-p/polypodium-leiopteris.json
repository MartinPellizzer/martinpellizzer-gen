    "intro": "Polypodium leiopteris, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground. Polypodium leiopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
