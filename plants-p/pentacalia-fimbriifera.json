    "intro": "Pentacalia fimbriifera, commonly known as the fringed pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Greater Antilles. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
