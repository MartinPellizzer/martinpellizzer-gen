    "intro": "Polystichum pennigerum, commonly known as the black pine fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. Polystichum pennigerum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright form."
