    "intro": "Polygala cornuta subsp. pollardii, commonly known as the Pollard's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygalaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
