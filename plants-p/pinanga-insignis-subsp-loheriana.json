    "intro": "Pinanga insignis subsp. loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's bamboo palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and elongated, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce yellowish-white flowers, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
