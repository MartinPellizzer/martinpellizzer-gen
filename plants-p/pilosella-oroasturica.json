    "intro": "Pilosella oroasturica, commonly known as the Oroasturi piloselle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a grayish-green appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Pilosella oroasturica is often found growing in rocky soils and open slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
