It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit, similar to the common guava, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit."
