    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a balsamic scent when scratched. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its wood is valued for its fragrance and durability, often used in the production of furniture and essential oils. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
