    "intro": "Psammophila arundinacea, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a halophyte plant adapted to arid and saline environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in loose, shifting sands."
