It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
