    "intro": "Podonephelium gongrocarpum, commonly known as the golden star sedge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Podonephelium gongrocarpum is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
