    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi var. rubra, commonly known as the red monkey orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its vivid red, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face, giving it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. Its unique floral structure and striking coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
