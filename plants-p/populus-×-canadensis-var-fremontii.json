    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of the Populus genus. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to wet soil conditions. Its fast growth rate makes it a valuable species for reforestation and erosion control."
