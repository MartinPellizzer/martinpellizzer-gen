    "intro": "Poa muricata, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Poa muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine-textured foliage."
