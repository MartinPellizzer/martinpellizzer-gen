    "intro": "Pteris chrysosperma, commonly known as the golden spore fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces golden-yellow spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Pteris chrysosperma thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
