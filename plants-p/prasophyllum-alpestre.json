    "intro": "Prasophyllum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine leek orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Prasophyllum alpestre is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and alpine meadows, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
