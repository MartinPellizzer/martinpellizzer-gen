    "intro": "Parita populneus, commonly known as the yellow poplar or western catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white to cream-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Parita populneus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
