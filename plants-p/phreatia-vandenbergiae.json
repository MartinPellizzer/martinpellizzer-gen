    "intro": "Phreatia vandenbergiae, commonly known as the Vandenberg's spider orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin pseudobulbs and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
