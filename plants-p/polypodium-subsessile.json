    "intro": "Polypodium subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium subsessile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
