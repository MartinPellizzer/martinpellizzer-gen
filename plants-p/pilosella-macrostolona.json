    "intro": "Pilosella macrostolona, commonly known as the large-stolonic pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its stems are often stolonic, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are yellow and produce small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind."
