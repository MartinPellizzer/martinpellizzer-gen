    "intro": "Penstemon pachyphyllus subsp. congestus, commonly known as the dense-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
