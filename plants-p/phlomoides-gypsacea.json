    "intro": "Phlomoides gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum phlomoides, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and gypsum deposits. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a compact growth habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
