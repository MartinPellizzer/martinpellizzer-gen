    "intro": "Prosopis chilensis var. riojana, commonly known as the Rioja Prosopis, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its long, pendulous pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in dry, saline soils and is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock. Its wood is also valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
