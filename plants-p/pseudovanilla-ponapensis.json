    "intro": "Pseudovanilla ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Vanilla genus but is classified under the subgenus Pseudovanilla, distinguishing it from true vanilla species. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
