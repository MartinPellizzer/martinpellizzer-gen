    "intro": "Potentilla nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodian cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and finely divided, serrated leaves. The plant thrives in rocky and sunny environments, often found in high-altitude meadows. It has a compact growth habit and produces red or orange berries in the autumn. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
