    "intro": "Pittosporum fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands in Chile. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
