    "intro": "Pedicularis inflexirostris, commonly known as the bent-beak lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling those of orchids. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or open areas with poor soil. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
