    "intro": "Poa retrofracta, commonly known as the broken blade grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Poa retrofracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
