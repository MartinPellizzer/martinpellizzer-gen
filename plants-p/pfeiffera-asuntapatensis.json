    "intro": "Pfeiffera asuntapatensis, commonly known as the Andean pfeiffera, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and palmate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
