    "intro": "Poilannammia allomorphioidea, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from shallow soil layers, and it thrives in cool, shaded conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
