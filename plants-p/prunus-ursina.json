    "intro": "Prunus ursina, commonly known as the bear cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Prunus ursina typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
