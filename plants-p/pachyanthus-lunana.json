    "intro": "Pachyanthus lunana, commonly known as the moonflower of Lunana, is a rare and striking plant native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its luminous blossoms. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachyanthus lunana is considered an endangered species."
