    "intro": "Pentzia, commonly known as the mountain zinnia, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly found in regions with high altitudes and arid conditions. They are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Pentzia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
