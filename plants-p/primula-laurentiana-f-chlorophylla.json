    "intro": "Primula laurentiana f. chlorophylla, commonly known as the chlorophyllous form of Laurentian primrose, is a variant characterized by its enhanced chlorophyll content. This results in a more intense green coloration of the leaves compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous perennial native to specific regions of North America. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its botanical interest lies in its unique pigmentation and its role in plant physiology studies."
