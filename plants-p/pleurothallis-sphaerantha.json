    "intro": "Pleurothallis sphaerantha, commonly known as the spherical pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in high humidity and partial shade. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. The flowers are often clustered at the tips of the stems, making it an attractive addition to specialized orchid collections."
