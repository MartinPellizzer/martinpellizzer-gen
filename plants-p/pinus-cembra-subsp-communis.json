    "intro": "Pinus cembra subsp. communis, commonly known as the stone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and contain edible seeds known as pine nuts. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and for the nutritional value of its seeds."
