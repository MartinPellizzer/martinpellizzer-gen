It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, green fruits. Prunus calycina is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
