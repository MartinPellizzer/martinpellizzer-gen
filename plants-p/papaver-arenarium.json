    "intro": "Papaver arenarium, commonly known as the sand poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in sandy environments. Papaver arenarium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
