    "intro": "Potentilla ruthenica var. diffusa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky or poor soils."
