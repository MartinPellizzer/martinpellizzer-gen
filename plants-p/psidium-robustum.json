    "intro": "Psidium robustum, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or rough guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value. Psidium robustum is also valued for its ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
