    "intro": "Pterospermum pecteniforme, commonly known as the fan-leaf pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble a fan. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Pterospermum pecteniforme is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
