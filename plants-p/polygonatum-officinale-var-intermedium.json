It features tall, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded woodland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The berries that follow the flowers are typically red or black and are edible when ripe."
