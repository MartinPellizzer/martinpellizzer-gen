    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia f. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's Virginia creeper, is a variant of the Virginia creeper native to North America. This climbing vine features compound leaves with five lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in autumn. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in tendrils, and it produces berries that change from green to red as they ripen. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb walls and trellises. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
