    "intro": "Phaseolus leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leafed bean, is a climbing legume native to Central America. It features compound leaves with elongated, slender leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by pods containing several round seeds. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited cultivation, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders."
