It features a short, hairy stem that typically grows up to 30 cm in height, bearing a single, showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flower with prominent purple or brown markings. The plant has palmately divided, hairy leaves that are basal and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. The flower blooms in early spring, usually between March and May, and is pollinated by bees and other insects."
