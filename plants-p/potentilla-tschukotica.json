    "intro": "Potentilla tschukotica, commonly known as the Tschukotka cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Siberia and Alaska. It thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky slopes, and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Potentilla tschukotica is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping for its ability to withstand extreme weather conditions."
