    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's threeleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
