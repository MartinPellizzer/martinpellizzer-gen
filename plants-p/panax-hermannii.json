    "intro": "Panax hermannii, commonly known as the Hermann's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, yellowish roots that are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with dark green, leathery leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a critically important species for conservation efforts. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax hermannii is now considered one of the most threatened ginseng species in the world."
