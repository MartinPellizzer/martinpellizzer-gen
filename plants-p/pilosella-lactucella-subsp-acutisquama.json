    "intro": "Pilosella lactucella subsp. acutisquama, commonly known as the sharp-lobed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves with acute, lobed margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
