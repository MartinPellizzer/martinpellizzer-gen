    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States, particularly in mountainous regions. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Its unique growth habit makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks. The tree is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
