    "intro": "Panicum marginale, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
