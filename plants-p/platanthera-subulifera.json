    "intro": "Platanthera subulifera, commonly known as the slender-leaf twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to parts of North America. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
