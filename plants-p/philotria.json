    "intro": "Philotria, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant found in coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. Philotria thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
