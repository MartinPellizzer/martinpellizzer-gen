    "intro": "Pteris concolor, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris concolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
