    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the evergreen potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
