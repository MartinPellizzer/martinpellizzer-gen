    "intro": "Peucedanum vourinense, commonly known as the Vourin's angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stem and compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small and ribbed, and it is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
