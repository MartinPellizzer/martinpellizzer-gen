    "intro": "Pityrogramma guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually pale green to silvery in color, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
