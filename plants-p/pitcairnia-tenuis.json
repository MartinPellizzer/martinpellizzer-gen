    "intro": "Pitcairnia tenuis, commonly known as the slender pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
