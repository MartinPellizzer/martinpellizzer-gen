    "intro": "Parthenocissus vitacea var. dubia, commonly known as the creeping ivy grape, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
