    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. orbignyana, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the tips of the stems, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
