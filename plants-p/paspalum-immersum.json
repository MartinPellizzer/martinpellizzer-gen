    "intro": "Paspalum immersum, commonly known as water paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often submerged or semi-aquatic. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Paspalum immersum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
