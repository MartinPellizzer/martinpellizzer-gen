It is characterized by its small size and distinctive, often cryptic coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat. The larvae of this species feed on various plants, primarily those found in wetland and bog environments. The adult moths are typically active during the night and are often found near water sources. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to pollination and serving as a food source for other organisms."
