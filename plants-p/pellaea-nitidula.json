    "intro": "Pellaea nitidula, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in a fine, waxy bloom. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
