    "intro": "Phyllanthus virgatus, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, greenish fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phyllanthus virgatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
