    "intro": "Psychotria viridiflora var. sylvatica, commonly known as the green-flowered psychotria, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive structures, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. The plant is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various alkaloids, though its medicinal or toxic properties remain under study."
