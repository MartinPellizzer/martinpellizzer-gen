    "intro": "Perdicium leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-capsule snub-nosed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive, smooth, greenish-brown capsules that mature into seed dispersal structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Perdicium leiocarpum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
