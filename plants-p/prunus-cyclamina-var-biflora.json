    "intro": "Prunus cyclamina var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its unique branching pattern, where two flower clusters emerge from a single stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Due to its rarity, it is a sought-after specimen among horticulturists and botanists."
