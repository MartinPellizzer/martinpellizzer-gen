It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wet meadows and marshes. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and its role in stabilizing soil in such environments."
