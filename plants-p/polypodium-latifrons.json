    "intro": "Polypodium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses."
