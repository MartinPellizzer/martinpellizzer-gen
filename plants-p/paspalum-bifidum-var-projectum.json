    "intro": "Paspalum bifidum var. projectum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in erosion control and restoration projects."
