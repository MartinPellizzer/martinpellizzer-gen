    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii var. grisancensis, commonly known as the gray-leaved potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
