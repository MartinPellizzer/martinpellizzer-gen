    "intro": "Polypodium knightiae, commonly known as the knight's polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates. Polypodium knightiae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
