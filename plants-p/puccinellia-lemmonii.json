    "intro": "Puccinellia lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, which helps reduce water loss. Puccinellia lemmonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
