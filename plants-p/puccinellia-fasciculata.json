    "intro": "Puccinellia fasciculata, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Puccinellia fasciculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
