    "intro": "Phaseolus panduratus var. tuberosus, commonly known as the Andean tuber, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Phaseolus species. Its tubers are rich in carbohydrates and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. The plant is also valued for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its potential for agricultural use in sustainable farming systems."
