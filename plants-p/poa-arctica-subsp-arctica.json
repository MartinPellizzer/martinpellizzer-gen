    "intro": "Poa arctica subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold climates. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This species is adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils and is commonly found in tundra and alpine environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in polar and high-altitude regions."
