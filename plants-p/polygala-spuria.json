    "intro": "Polygala spuria, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygalaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with distinctive spurs extending from the petals. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
