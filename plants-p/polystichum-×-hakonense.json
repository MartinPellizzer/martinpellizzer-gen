    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 hakonense, commonly known as the Hakon's fern, is a hybrid evergreen fern native to Japan. It features dark green, lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dense and arching, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients."
