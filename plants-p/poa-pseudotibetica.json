    "intro": "Poa pseudotibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa pseudotibetica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments."
