It typically grows in open, grassy habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that bears small, two-ranked spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
