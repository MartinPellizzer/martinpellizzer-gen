    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subvar. argentata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and compact growth habit."
