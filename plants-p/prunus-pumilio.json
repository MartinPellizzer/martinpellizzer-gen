    "intro": "Prunus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or miniature cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems forming a bushy shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible cherries that are typically red when mature. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus pumilio is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and seasonal interest."
