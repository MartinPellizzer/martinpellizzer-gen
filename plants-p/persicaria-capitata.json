    "intro": "Persicaria capitata, commonly known as the clustered knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. Its most distinctive feature is its dense, spherical clusters of small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Persicaria capitata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
