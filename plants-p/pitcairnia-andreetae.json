    "intro": "Pitcairnia andreetae, commonly known as the Andean pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate, colorful patterns. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a pineapple, with a central flower surrounded by numerous smaller blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia andreetae is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
