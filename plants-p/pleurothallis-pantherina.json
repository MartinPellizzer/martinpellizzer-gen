    "intro": "Pleurothallis pantherina, commonly known as the panther orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns resembling a panther's spots, giving it its common name. The plant has wiry, fibrous roots that help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
