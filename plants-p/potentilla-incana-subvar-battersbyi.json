    "intro": "Potentilla incana subvar. battersbyi, commonly known as the Battersby's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features wiry, silver-gray stems covered in dense, white-haired foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
