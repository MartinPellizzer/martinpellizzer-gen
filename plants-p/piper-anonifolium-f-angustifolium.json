It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into large, spiky fruits resembling those of the common soursop. The fruit's interior contains a white, fleshy pulp with numerous black seeds. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
