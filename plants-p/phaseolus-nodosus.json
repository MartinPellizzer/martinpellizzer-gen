    "intro": "Phaseolus nodosus, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is known for its ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots due to a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. This makes it an important plant in agricultural systems for soil enrichment."
