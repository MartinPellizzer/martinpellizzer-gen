    "intro": "Pleurothallis sobrina, commonly known as the silver orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Pleurothallis sobrina is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
