    "intro": "Paranephelium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan parasol tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble a parasol. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
