    "intro": "Prosopis nigra var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny branches, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of long, slender pods containing seeds. It has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets."
