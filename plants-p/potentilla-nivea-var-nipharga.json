    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. nipharga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and are often clustered in corymbs. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
