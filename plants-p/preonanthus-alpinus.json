    "intro": "Preonanthus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils where it is exposed to strong winds and low temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Preonanthus alpinus plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
