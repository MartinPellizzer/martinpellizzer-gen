    "intro": "Poa rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dark reddish stems, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the reddish stems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
