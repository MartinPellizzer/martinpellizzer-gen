    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 nonfordium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from various pelargonium species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
