    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. longispicatum, commonly known as the long-spined smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that give it its common name."
