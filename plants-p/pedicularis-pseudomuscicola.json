    "intro": "Pedicularis pseudomuscicola, commonly known as the false musk orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts pollinators. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East."
