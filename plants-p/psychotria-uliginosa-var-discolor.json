It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its striking purple and green variegated leaves, which are often marked with distinctive patterns. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its ornamental value in humid environments. This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species, some of which contain psychoactive alkaloids."
