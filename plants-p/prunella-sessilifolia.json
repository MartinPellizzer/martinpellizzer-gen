    "intro": "Prunella sessilifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved heal-all, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Prunella sessilifolia is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
