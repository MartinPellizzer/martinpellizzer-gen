    "intro": "Perdicium bocconiifolium, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
