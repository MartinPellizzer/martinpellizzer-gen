It is a member of the Moraceae family, which also includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Premna discolor is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
