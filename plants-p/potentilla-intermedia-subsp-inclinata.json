It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, often prostrate stems that can form dense mats, aiding in soil stabilization. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of five oval leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
