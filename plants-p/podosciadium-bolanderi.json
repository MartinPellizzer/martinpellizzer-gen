    "intro": "Podosciadium bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. It is adapted to mild, temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
