    "intro": "Panicum fragile, commonly known as brittlegrass, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its fragile nature gives it its common name, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
