    "intro": "Prunus colchica, commonly known as the Persian cherry or Prunus colchica, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, single white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, though they are typically not cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it has a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for ornamental planting. Prunus colchica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical significance in traditional medicine."
