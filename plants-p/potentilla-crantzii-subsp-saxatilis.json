    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a compact growth habit with multiple stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded landscapes."
