    "intro": "Pedicularis pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, often reddish or violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the roots of host plants, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor alpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
