    "intro": "Psittacanthus cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, hood-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, clustered foliage that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and striking plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats."
