    "intro": "Phoebe microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved phoebe, is a member of the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, elliptical leaves. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils and shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by dark, oval berries. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Phoebe microphylla is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
