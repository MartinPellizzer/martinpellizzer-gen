    "intro": "Polypodium reticulatum, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to rocky surfaces. Polypodium reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
