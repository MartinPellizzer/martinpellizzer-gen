    "intro": "Psychotria chaponiana, commonly known as the Chapon's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It often grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is typically found in the understory of the forest canopy. Psychotria chaponiana is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
