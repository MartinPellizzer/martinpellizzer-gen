It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, streambanks, and ditches. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often covered in a sticky substance, which is a characteristic feature of the species. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive reddish hue, especially along the veins. The small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late summer, producing tiny, three-lobed seeds."
