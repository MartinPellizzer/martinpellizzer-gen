    "intro": "Phelypaea macrantha, commonly known as the large-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating rosette, with long, thin roots that anchor it in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Phelypaea macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
