    "intro": "Pteronia carnosa, commonly known as the hardy pterony, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
