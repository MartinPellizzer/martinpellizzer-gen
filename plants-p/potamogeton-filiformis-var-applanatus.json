It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often flattened against the water surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters near the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its growth is often influenced by water clarity, nutrient levels, and light availability."
