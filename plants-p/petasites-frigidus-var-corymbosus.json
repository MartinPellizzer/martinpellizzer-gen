    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. corymbosus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in corymbs, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
