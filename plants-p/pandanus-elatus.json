    "intro": "Pandanus elatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are often used in traditional crafts. Its fibrous leaves are also utilized for thatching and basket-making. Pandanus elatus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, adapting well to saline conditions."
