It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with feathery bracts, which aid in wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate appearance."
