    "intro": "Pedicularis hypophylla, commonly known as the dwarf monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique shape that resembles a monkey's face, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
