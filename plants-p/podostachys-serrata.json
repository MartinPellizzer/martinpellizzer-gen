It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often submerged in water, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as streams and lakes. Due to its specialized morphology, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
