    "intro": "Phlomis pallida, commonly known as pale mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and gray-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Phlomis pallida is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
