    "intro": "Polypodium axillare, commonly known as the axillary polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with fertile pinnae that produce sporangia on the underside. Polypodium axillare is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
