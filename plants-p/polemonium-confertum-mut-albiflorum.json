    "intro": "Polemonium confertum mut. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered Jacob's ladder, is a variant of the Jacob's ladder plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, cascading clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin and the pale coloration of its flowers."
