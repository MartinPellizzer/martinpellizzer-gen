    "intro": "Polypodium filipes, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium filipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
