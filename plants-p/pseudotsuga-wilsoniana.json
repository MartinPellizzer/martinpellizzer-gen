    "intro": "Pseudotsuga wilsoniana, commonly known as the Wilson's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The wood of Wilson's fir is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
