    "intro": "Phleum phalarideum, commonly known as meadow brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Meadow brome is an important forage plant for livestock and also serves as a host for certain insect species."
