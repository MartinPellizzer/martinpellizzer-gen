    "intro": "Pleopeltis jakonensis, commonly known as the Kajon fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pleopeltis jakonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
