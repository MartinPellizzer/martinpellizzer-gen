It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are round and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
