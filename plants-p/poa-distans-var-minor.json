    "intro": "Poa distans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and habitat-providing qualities."
