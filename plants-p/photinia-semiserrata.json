    "intro": "Photinia semiserrata, commonly known as the serrated photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Photinia semiserrata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and seasonal color changes."
