    "intro": "Prunus cerasus semperflorens, commonly known as the cherry blossom or Japanese cherry, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom profusely in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn green in summer and yellow in autumn. Its fruit, a small cherry, is edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. The plant is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value and cultural significance."
