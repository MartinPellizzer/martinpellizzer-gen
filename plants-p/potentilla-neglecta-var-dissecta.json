    "intro": "Potentilla neglecta var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
