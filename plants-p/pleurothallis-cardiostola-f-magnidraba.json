    "intro": "Pleurothallis cardiostola f. magnidraba, commonly known as the large-leafed pleurothallis, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often densely covered with a velvety pubescence, contributing to its unique appearance. The flowers are typically small, clustered in inflorescences, and exhibit a range of colors from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. This orchid thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
