    "intro": "Pilea repens, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a popular houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It is a trailing plant with heart-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in indirect light and well-draining soil, making it easy to care for. Its ability to spread via runners makes it ideal for hanging baskets or tabletop displays."
