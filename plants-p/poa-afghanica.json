    "intro": "Poa afghanica, commonly known as Afghan grass, is a species of grass native to Central Asia, including regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Middle East. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky, or mountainous environments. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa afghanica is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
