    "intro": "Pachypleurum schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's thickpleurum, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is seldom cultivated outside its native range."
