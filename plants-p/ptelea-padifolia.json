    "intro": "Ptelea padifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Ptelea padifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. Its dense growth habit makes it valuable for erosion control and habitat restoration in desert ecosystems."
