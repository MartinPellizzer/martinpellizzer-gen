    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. orbicularis, commonly known as the variable cherry or the white flowering cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its orbicular or round leaves, which distinguish it from the typical ovate or lanceolate leaves of the species. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in early spring, which can change color as the season progresses. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates. The f. orbicularis form is particularly valued for its compact growth habit and seasonal color variations."
