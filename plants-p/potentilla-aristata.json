It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers in early summer. Potentilla aristata is often used in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
