    "intro": "Pinus banksiana f. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping white pine, is a unique variant of the white pine species. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling branches that often form a dense mat on the ground. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, typically in bundles of five, which are a soft green color. This form is well adapted to harsh environments, such as sandy soils and open, disturbed areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
