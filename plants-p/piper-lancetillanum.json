    "intro": "Piper lancetillanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pepper vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant features slender, woody stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated for its fruit or medicinal properties."
