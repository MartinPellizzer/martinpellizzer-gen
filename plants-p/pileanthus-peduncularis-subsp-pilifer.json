The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance and helps in identifying it from related species."
