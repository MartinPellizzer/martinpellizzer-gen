    "intro": "Petrophile ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Petrophile ericifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
