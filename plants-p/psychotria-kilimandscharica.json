    "intro": "Psychotria kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
