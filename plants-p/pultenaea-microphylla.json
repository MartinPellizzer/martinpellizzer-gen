    "intro": "Pultenaea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves and produces yellow floral clusters that bloom in spring. It is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its deep root system. Pultenaea microphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
