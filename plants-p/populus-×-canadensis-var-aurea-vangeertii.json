    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canadensis var. aurea-vangeertii, commonly known as the golden weeping poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fast growth rate and distinctive, cascading foliage that turns a vibrant yellow in the fall. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fluffy seeds in cone-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide quick shade in landscapes."
