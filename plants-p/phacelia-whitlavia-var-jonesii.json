    "intro": "Phacelia whitlavia var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
