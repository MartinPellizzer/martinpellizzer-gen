    "intro": "Periphragmos flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible periphragm, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Periphragmos flexuosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
