    "intro": "Psephellus andinus, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. It produces yellow or white flowers during the summer months, and its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Psephellus andinus is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
