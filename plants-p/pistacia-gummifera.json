    "intro": "Pistacia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is notable for exuding a sticky, resinous gum from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
