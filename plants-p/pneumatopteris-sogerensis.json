    "intro": "Pneumatopteris sogerensis, commonly known as the Sogeri's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of sori on the underside of the leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with spores produced in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized indusium. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pneumatopteris sogerensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
