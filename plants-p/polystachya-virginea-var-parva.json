    "intro": "Polystachya virginea var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf flame grass, is a compact, evergreen herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish or bronze hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the dry season. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in humid climates. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is relatively low maintenance once established."
