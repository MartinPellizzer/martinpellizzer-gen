    "intro": "Platystele ovatilabia, commonly known as the ovate-labellum platystele, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive ovate-shaped labellum. The plant belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele ovatilabia is considered a rare and endangered species."
