    "intro": "Prosopis, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a genus of shrubs and trees native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often small and feather-like, and their pods that contain edible seeds. Prosopis species are drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them important in desert ecosystems. They play a vital role in soil stabilization and provide food for wildlife and humans. The wood of some species is used for fuel and construction, while others are valued for their ornamental appeal."
