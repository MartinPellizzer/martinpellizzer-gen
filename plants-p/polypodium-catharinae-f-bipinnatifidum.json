    "intro": "Polypodium catharinae f. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnatifid fronds that are finely divided and resemble lace. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
