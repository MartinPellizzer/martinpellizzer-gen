    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. plena, commonly known as the common pear with double flowers, is a cultivar of the European pear. It is characterized by its abundant, showy, white flowers that are double in structure, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical pears. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. It produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but less commonly cultivated for commercial use. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
