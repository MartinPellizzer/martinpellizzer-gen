    "intro": "Platostoma chinense, commonly known as the Chinese flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Platostoma chinense is relatively uncommon and is of interest to lichenologists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
