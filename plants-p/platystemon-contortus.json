    "intro": "Platystemon contortus, commonly known as the twisted platystemon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
