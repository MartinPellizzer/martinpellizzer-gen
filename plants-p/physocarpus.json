    "intro": "Physocarpus, commonly known as Ninebark, is a genus of deciduous shrubs native to North America. It is characterized by its papery, peeling bark that becomes visible as the plant matures. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. The flowers are small and white or pink, appearing in clusters, and they are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Physocarpus species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and hardiness."
