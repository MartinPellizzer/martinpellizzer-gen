    "intro": "Pleurothallis cedralensis, commonly known as the Cedral mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on tree trunks or branches in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
