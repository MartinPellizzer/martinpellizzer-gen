    "intro": "Pandanus calceiformis, commonly known as the pandanus with fleshy roots, is a species of flowering plant in the Pandanaceae family. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Australia, New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters at the base of the leaves."
