    "intro": "Pinus chylla, commonly known as the Chilla pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. Pinus chylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
