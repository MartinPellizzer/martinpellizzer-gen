    "intro": "Polygala leptandroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
