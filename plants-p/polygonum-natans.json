    "intro": "Polygonum natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its floating, leafless stems that bear small, spathulate leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in water and absorbing nutrients, while its stems are buoyant due to air-filled cavities. Polygonum natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
