    "intro": "Phylica pustulata, commonly known as the silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its unique silvery coloration. Phylica pustulata is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
