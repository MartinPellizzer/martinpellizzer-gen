    "intro": "Pultenaea villosa, commonly known as the silky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and small, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. Pultenaea villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
