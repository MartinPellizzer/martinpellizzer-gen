    "intro": "Polypodium catharinae, commonly known as the Catrina fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
