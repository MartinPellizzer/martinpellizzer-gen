It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often resembling miniature orchids. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
