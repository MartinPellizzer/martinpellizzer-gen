    "intro": "Pinalia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pinyon, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes true pines, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid climates. Its small, edible seeds are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant's resilience to drought and its ability to colonize disturbed areas make it a significant component of its ecosystem."
