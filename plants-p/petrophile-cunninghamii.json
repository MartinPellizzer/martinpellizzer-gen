    "intro": "Petrophile cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain daisy-bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Petrophile cunninghamii is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
