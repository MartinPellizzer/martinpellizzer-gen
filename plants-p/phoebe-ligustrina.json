    "intro": "Phoebe ligustrina, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
