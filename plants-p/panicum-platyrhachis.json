    "intro": "Panicum platyrhachis, commonly known as broad-leaf bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically light blue to purple in color, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable native plant in ecological restoration projects."
