    "intro": "Pavonia sessiliflora f. ecostata, commonly known as the flat-leaf pavonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without stalks. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
