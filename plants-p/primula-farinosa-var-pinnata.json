    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. pinnata, commonly known as the pinnate primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, hairy, and sometimes toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
