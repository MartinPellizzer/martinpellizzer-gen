    "intro": "Prenanthes decurrens, commonly known as the running ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that often sprawl along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and serrated edges. Prenanthes decurrens is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along stream banks."
