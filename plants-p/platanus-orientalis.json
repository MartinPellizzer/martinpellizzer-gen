    "intro": "Platanus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental plane tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, flaky, and develops deep fissures with age. Platanus orientalis is often planted in urban areas for its shade and ornamental value."
