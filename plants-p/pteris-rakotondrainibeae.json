    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pteris rakotondrainibeabe, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are dispersed through the air, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The botanical features of this fern make it an important species for studying tropical flora and ecological adaptations."
