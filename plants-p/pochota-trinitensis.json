    "intro": "Pochota trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Pochota trinitensis thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas within forest understories."
