It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive dark brown or purple lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape. This species is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
