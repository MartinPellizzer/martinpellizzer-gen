    "intro": "Polygonella parvifolia var. subenervis, commonly known as the small-leaved mountain moss, is a variant of the polygonella genus native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in water retention. The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
