    "intro": "Prunus verrucosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Japanese yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Prunus verrucosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and as a specimen plant in gardens."
