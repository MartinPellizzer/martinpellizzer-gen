    "intro": "Piptolaena dregei, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Piptolaena dregei is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
