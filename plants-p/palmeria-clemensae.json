    "intro": "Palmeria clemensae, commonly known as the San Clemente palmeria, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the San Clemente Island in California. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with clustered leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its island home. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
