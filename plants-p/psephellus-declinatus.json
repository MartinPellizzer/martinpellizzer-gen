    "intro": "Psephellus declinatus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area. Psephellus declinatus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to rocky or disturbed habitats."
