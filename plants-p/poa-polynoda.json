It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa polynoda is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
