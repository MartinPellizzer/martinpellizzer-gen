    "intro": "Peliosanthes lurida, commonly known as the darkleaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones bearing yellowish pollen sacs and the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peliosanthes lurida is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after in horticultural and scientific circles."
