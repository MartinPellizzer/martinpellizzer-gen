    "intro": "Palmorchis loretana, commonly known as the Loretana's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a sympodial growth habit and a single, elongated leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
