    "intro": "Prunus padus var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched, horn-like twigs that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
