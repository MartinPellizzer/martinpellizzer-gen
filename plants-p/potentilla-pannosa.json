It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
