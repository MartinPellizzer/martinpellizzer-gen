    "intro": "Phyllomphax siamensis, commonly known as the Siam sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has a short rhizome and produces a single inflorescence with several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
