    "intro": "Polygonum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stout, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Polygonum spinosum is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
