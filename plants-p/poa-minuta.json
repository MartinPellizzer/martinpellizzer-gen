    "intro": "Poa minuta, commonly known as dwarf mountain grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Poa minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
