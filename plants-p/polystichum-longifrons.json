    "intro": "Polystichum longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a feathery, bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in woodland habitats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural ecosystems."
