    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
