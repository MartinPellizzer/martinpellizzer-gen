It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a tuft of silky, hair-like florets at the apex. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
