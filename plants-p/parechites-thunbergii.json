It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
