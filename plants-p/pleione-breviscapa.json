    "intro": "Pleione breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, deciduous pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the spring season. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
