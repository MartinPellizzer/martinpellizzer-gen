    "intro": "Panicum macrophyllum, commonly known as giant foxtail, is a tall grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, which includes other grasses."
