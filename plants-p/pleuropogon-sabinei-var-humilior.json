    "intro": "Pleuropogon sabinei var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf false panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
