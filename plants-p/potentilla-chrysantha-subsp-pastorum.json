    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha subsp. pastorum, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of bright yellow blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of whitish hair, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, rocky soils and cold climates, making it a resilient member of alpine ecosystems."
