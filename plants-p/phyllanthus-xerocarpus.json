    "intro": "Phyllanthus xerocarpus, commonly known as the desert phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a hard, dry capsule containing several seeds. It is well adapted to survive in poor soils and can withstand long periods of drought. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
