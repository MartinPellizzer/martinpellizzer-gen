It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
