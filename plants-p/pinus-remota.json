    "intro": "Pinus remota, commonly known as the remote pine, is a species of conifer native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of Pinus remota are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
