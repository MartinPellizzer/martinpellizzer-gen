    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. subovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are shorter and more pointed compared to the typical form. This subspecies is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cold and moist environments. Its conical shape and dense foliage make it well-suited for mountainous climates. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
