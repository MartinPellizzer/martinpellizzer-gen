It features a basal rosette of dark green, arrow-shaped leaves and produces striking red-orange flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its unique underground root system, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its name derives from the red color of its roots, which were historically used for dyeing fabrics."
