    "intro": "Paepalanthus ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed puya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces striking red and orange bracts that surround the inflorescence, which is often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Paepalanthus ruficeps is also known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
