    "intro": "Panoe, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruits are pods that contain flat, elongated seeds. Due to its high value, Panoe is often overharvested, leading to conservation concerns."
