    "intro": "Populus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201312 cm long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. Populus lancifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
