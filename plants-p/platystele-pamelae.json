    "intro": "Platystele pamelae, commonly known as the Pamelae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur, typical of many epiphytic orchids. It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele pamelae is considered critically endangered."
