    "intro": "Plantaginorchis prionocraspedon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and reduced floral structures. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its symbiotic relationship with soil microorganisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
