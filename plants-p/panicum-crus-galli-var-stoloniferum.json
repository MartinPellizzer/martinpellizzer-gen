    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. stoloniferum, commonly known as silver millet or prostrate millet, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles that are often used as ornamental features in gardens. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
