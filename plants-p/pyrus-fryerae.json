    "intro": "Pyrus fryerae, commonly known as the Fryer's pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this unique botanical species."
