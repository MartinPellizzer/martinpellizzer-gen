    "intro": "Phoradendron rubrum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem and a system of haustoria that allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. This species is notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that eat its berries."
