    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba subvar. vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic bloodroot, is a member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to regions with volcanic soils, particularly in Japan and parts of China. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
