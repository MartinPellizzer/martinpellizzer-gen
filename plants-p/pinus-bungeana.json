    "intro": "Pinus bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long and have a bluish-green hue. The tree produces yellowish to reddish cones that mature over several years, with the seeds being dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
