    "intro": "Pyrus buschiana, commonly known as the Busch pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Pyrus buschiana is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
