    "intro": "Phegopteris manniana, commonly known as the eastern climbing fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fuzzy spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes spread along the ground, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, with a distinct, curled shape that aids in its identification."
