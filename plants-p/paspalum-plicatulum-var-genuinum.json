It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
