    "intro": "Pinus montereyensis, commonly known as the Monterey pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of central California. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive, flattened, scale-like bark. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters and has a conical shape with a narrow crown. Its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The Monterey pine is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers."
