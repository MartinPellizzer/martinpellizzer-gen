    "intro": "Polemoniella antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic polemonium, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Polemoniella antarctica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with strong winds and limited soil."
