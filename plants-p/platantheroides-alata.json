    "intro": "Platantheroides alata, commonly known as the winged lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of pale green to white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
