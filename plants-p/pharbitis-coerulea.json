It is characterized by its rapid growth and heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often opening in the morning. Its vines can climb and twine around supports, making it a popular ornamental plant. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule and are dispersed by wind."
