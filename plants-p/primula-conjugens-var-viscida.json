    "intro": "Primula conjugens var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
