    "intro": "Pereskia aculeata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cactus or the African hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered with small, stiff spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by orange or red fruits. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and they are often mistaken for leaves of flowering plants rather than cacti. This species is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
