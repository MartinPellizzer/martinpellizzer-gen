    "intro": "Pinus mugo var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and twisted, gnarled form, which makes it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. The tree typically reaches a height of only 1 to 2 meters, with short, stout branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in clusters. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is particularly hardy, capable of surviving in poor soil and extreme weather conditions."
