    "intro": "Polygonum biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface, while its small, greenish flowers appear in dense clusters. Polygonum biforme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in wet conditions."
