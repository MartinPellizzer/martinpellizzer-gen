    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
