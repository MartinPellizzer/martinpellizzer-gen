    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris convar. sphaericus, commonly known as the round-seeded common bean, is a variant of the common bean species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spherical or nearly spherical seeds, which distinguish it from other varieties with elongated or oval seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with compound leaves and produces pods that contain the edible seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is cultivated for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and essential nutrients. This convarietal is widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions for both food and agricultural purposes."
