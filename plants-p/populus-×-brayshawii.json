    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 brayshawii, commonly known as the brayshawii poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is a cross between Populus balsamifera and Populus trichocarpa, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
