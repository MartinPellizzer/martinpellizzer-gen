    "intro": "Pleurogramme sulcata, commonly known as the pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Pleurogramme sulcata is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
