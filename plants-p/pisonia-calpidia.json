    "intro": "Pisonia calpidia, commonly known as the Christmas cherry, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Pisonia calpidia thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems."
