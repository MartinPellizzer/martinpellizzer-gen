It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along creek beds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
