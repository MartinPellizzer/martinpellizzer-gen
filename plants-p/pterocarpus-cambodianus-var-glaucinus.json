It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and distinctive, compound leaves with a glaucous underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
