    "intro": "Pernettya leucocarpa var. buxifolia, commonly known as the white-fruited cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small, round berries that are white or yellow when mature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal interest."
