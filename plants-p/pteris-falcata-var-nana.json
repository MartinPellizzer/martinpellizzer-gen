    "intro": "Pteris falcata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a compact fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically shorter than those of the standard Pteris falcata, with a dense, bushy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The fronds are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and enhance its adaptability to wet conditions."
