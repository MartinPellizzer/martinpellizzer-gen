    "intro": "Polypodium austrobrasilianum, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium austrobrasilianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
