    "intro": "Pasania beccariana, commonly known as the Bornean starvine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
