    "intro": "Pleopeltis steirolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, with the lower leaves being more elongated than the upper ones."
