    "intro": "Polystichum costularisorum, commonly known as the Costularis fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
