    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitat."
