    "intro": "Pyrus oligodonta, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red or orange as they mature. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Pyrus oligodonta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
