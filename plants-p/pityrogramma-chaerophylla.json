    "intro": "Pityrogramma chaerophylla, commonly known as the silver-stemmed water fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb sufficient humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pityrogramma chaerophylla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid climates."
