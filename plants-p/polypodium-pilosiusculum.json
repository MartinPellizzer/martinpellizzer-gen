    "intro": "Polypodium pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
