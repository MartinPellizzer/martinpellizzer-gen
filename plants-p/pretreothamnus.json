    "intro": "Pretreothamnus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or green berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in pairs, and it lacks true roots. Pretreothamnus is found predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature."
