    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain pseudocyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive marginal toothed pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns and contribute to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
