    "intro": "Phacelia ambigua, commonly known as the slender phacelia, is an annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Phacelia ambigua is also valued as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
