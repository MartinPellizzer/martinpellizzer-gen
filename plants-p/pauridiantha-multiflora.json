It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
