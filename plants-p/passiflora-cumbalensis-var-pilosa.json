    "intro": "Passiflora cumbalensis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The leaves are typically large, palmately lobed, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by local communities. It is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
