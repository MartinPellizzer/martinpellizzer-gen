    "intro": "Pyrus lonetalensis, commonly known as the Lonetal pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir ranges. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like apple, is typically edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus lonetalensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
