    "intro": "Phyllanthus insignis, commonly known as the Indian mallow or sacred plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring simple, alternate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Phyllanthus insignis has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
