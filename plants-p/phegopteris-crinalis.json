    "intro": "Phegopteris crinalis, commonly known as the silky cliffbrake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Phegopteris crinalis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is an indicator species for certain types of forest ecosystems."
