    "intro": "Pteris lutea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green veins, creating a striking visual appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental value in gardens and indoor settings."
