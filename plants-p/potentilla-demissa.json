    "intro": "Potentilla demissa, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Potentilla demissa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, rocky areas, and along stream banks."
