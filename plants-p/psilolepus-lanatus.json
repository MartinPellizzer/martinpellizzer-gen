    "intro": "Psilolepus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly psilolepus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces small, bright yellow apothecia that are often clustered together. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
