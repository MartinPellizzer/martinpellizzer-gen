    "intro": "Pilosella calodon subsp. tenuiceps, commonly known as slender-headed hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Pilosella calodon subsp. tenuiceps is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a minor weed in agricultural areas."
