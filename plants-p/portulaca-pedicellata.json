    "intro": "Portulaca pedicellata, commonly known as the clustered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically hairy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to drought conditions. Its ability to store water in its leaves and stems allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
