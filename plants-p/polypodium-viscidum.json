    "intro": "Polypodium viscidum, commonly known as the sticky polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium viscidum is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
