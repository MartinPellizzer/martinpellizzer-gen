    "intro": "Pelargonium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form and is well-suited for container gardening. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium tomentosum is prized for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
