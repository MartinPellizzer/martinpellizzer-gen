    "intro": "Pennisetum humile, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching blades that form a dense, fountain-like shape, typically growing to a height of about 12 to 18 inches. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest, especially in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Pennisetum humile is drought-tolerant and is often used in landscaping for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
