    "intro": "Psychotria koniamboensis, commonly known as the Koniambo Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
