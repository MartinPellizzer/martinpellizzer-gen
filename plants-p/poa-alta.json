    "intro": "Poa alta, commonly known as mountain grass or highland bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, blue-green leaves. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky or eroded areas. Poa alta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
