    "intro": "Poa hentyi, commonly known as Henty's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Poa hentyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
