    "intro": "Paullinia obovata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and moist forests. Paullinia obovata is also known for its aromatic leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine."
