    "intro": "Poa gelida, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa gelida has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat."
