    "intro": "Penstemon puniceus var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to lavender tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
