    "intro": "Pennisetum chilense var. planifolium, commonly known as the Chilean fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that give it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle color. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its fine foliage and ability to form dense, compact clumps."
