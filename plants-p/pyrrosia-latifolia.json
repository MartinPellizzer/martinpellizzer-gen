    "intro": "Pyrrosia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
