    "intro": "Pyrola groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, leathery leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, often with a distinctive dark spot at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as boreal forests and alpine tundra. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health."
