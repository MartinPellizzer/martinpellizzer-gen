    "intro": "Pitcairnia reflexiflora var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
