    "intro": "Pseudosempervivum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and compact growth habit, often forming rosettes. They are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are adapted to rocky or arid environments. Pseudosempervivum species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, pink, or white. They are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
