    "intro": "Peyotl zacatensis var. fricii, commonly known as the Mexican peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It contains the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used for centuries in spiritual and medicinal practices by indigenous communities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with a rounded, segmented stem that stores water. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is protected in many regions and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
