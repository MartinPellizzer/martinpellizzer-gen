    "intro": "Pontederia rotundifolia var. nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color and are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can lead to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness in non-native environments. The plant is often used in ornamental water gardens but requires careful management due to its aggressive spreading nature."
