    "intro": "Pseudobaeckea gracilis, commonly known as the slender pseudobaeckea, is a small shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in gardens across Australia."
