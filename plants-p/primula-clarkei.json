It is characterized by its clustered, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from cold temperatures. Primula clarkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
