    "intro": "Pachygenium saltense, commonly known as the salt marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Pachygenium saltense plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
