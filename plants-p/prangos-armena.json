    "intro": "Prangos armena, commonly known as Armenian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features a robust taproot and tall, hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces purple to violet flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Prangos armena is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones."
