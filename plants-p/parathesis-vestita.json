    "intro": "Parathesis vestita, commonly known as the naked bracket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat."
