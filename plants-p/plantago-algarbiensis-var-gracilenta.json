    "intro": "Plantago algarbiensis var. gracilenta, commonly known as the slender plantain, is a variant of the plantain species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies."
