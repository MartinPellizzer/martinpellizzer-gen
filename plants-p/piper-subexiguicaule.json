It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other species of pepper plants. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, round berries. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
