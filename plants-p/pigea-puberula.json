    "intro": "Pigea puberula, commonly known as the hairy pigeonwings, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is native to parts of southern Africa, where it typically grows in grassy or disturbed habitats. Pigea puberula is often found in open areas with well-drained soil, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
