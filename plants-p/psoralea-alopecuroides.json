It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
