    "intro": "Potentilla sulfurea, commonly known as sulfur potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and forms dense mats, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cool, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
