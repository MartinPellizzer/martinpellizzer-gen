    "intro": "Packera flettii, commonly known as Flett's brittleblow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, rocky soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Packera flettii produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
