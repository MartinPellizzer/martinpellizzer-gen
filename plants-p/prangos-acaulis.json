    "intro": "Prangos acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafless stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Prangos acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
