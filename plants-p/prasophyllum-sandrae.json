    "intro": "Prasophyllum sandrae, commonly known as the Sandra's leek orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments, often growing in dense vegetation. It is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild."
