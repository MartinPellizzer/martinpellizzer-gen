    "intro": "Ponerorchis limprichtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly face, earning it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis limprichtii is considered a rare and endangered species."
