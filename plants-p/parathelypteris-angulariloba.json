    "intro": "Parathelypteris angulariloba, commonly known as the angular-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive angular shape and serrated margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to submerged or semi-submerged substrates. The fronds are typically green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or wetland ecosystems."
