    "intro": "Philodendron multinervum, commonly known as the veined philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is usually a deep green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. Philodendron multinervum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
