    "intro": "Paronychia pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
