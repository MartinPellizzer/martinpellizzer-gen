    "intro": "Petrorhagia, commonly known as the rock catchfly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of about 50 species, predominantly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with hairy, often succulent stems and small, clustered flowers. Their flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in the spring or early summer. Petrorhagia species are adapted to rocky and dry environments, making them resilient to harsh conditions."
