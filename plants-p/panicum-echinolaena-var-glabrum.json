    "intro": "Panicum echinolaena var. glabrum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, fibrous foliage. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and rigid, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
