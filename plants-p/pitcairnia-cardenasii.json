    "intro": "Pitcairnia cardenasii, commonly known as the Candelabra Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red inflorescences that resemble candles, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
