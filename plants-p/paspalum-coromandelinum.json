    "intro": "Paspalum coromandelinum, commonly known as the Indian paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is used in some regions for forage or as a stabilizing plant in wetland restoration projects."
