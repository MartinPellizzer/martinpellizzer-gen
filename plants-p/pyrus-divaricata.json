    "intro": "Pyrus divaricata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
