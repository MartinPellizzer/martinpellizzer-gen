    "intro": "Plectrophora triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy thallus with distinct, three-lobed structures that give it its common name. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Plectrophora triquetra plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
