    "intro": "Pteris oligodyctyon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Pteris oligodyctyon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
