    "intro": "Phlegmariurus quadriforiatus, commonly known as the four-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, flat, green thallus that forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of rhizoids and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. This non-vascular plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
