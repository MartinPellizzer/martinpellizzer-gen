    "intro": "Phalaenopsis tetraspis f. imperatrix, commonly known as the Imperial Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its elegant, long-lasting blooms. It features broad, waxy petals and a prominent, often colorful lip that distinguishes it from other orchid varieties. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining potting media. Its flowers typically last several months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
