    "intro": "Pandanus pakari, commonly known as the Andean screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional weaving practices. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its structure consists of a woody stem with spirally arranged leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fruit. Despite its hardy nature, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
