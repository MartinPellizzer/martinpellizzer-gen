    "intro": "Panicum pusillum var. glabriglumatum, commonly known as the smooth panic grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, though the variety glabriglumatum is distinguished by its smoother, hairless appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
