    "intro": "Pyrus vernae, commonly known as the spring pear, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
