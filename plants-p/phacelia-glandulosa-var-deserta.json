    "intro": "Phacelia glandulosa var. deserta, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
