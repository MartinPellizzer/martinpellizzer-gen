    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia subsp. osca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration. It is a hemiparasitic species, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
