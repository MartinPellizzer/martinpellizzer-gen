    "intro": "Phreatia quadrata, commonly known as the quadrata orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Phreatia quadrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
