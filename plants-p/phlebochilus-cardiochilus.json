It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Africa, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
