    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum f. oligostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed paspalum, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, linear leaves with a smooth texture and typically grows in coastal or saline environments. The inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that is often more compact than the typical form of the species. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common plant in dune ecosystems. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
