    "intro": "Paloue durissima, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
