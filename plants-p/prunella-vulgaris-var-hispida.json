    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. hispida, commonly known as hedge bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and whorled leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and often grows in clusters. Its hairy texture and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in herbal medicine."
