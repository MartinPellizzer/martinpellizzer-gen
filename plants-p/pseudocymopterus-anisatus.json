    "intro": "Pseudocymopterus anisatus, commonly known as the hairy false cymopterus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant typically grows on the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from its host. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it is often found in forested or grassy areas. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
