    "intro": "Prospero depressum, commonly known as the low-growing evergreen shrub, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal gardens."
