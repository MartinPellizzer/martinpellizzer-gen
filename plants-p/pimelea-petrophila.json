    "intro": "Pimelea petrophila, commonly known as the rock pimelea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pimelea petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
