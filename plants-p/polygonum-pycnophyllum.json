    "intro": "Polygonum pycnophyllum, commonly known as the dense-leaved knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact cluster at the base. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Polygonum pycnophyllum is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
