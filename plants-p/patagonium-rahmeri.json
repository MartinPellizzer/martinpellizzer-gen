    "intro": "Patagonium rahmeri, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf lichen, is a unique lichen species found in the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, forming a crust-like growth on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to harsh, cold, and dry environments. Its structure is typically thin and flat, with a pale green to yellowish coloration. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
