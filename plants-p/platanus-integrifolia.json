    "intro": "Platanus integrifolia, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in patches to reveal a smooth, lighter-colored surface beneath. The tree has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long and have a rough, sandpapery texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruits are woody spheres that split open to release seeds. The American sycamore is often found along riverbanks and is known for its rapid growth and longevity."
