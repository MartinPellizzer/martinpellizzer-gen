    "intro": "Padus nana, commonly known as dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems and dense foliage of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for gardens and natural habitats."
