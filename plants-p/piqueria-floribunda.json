    "intro": "Piqueria floribunda, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tiny disk flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. Piqueria floribunda is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
