    "intro": "Pinus maestraensis, commonly known as the Maestraensis pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it adapts to cooler and drier conditions. Its botanical features include a straight trunk, dark bark, and dense foliage that provides habitat for various local wildlife. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
