    "intro": "Paspalum prostratum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed by the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species in disturbed or aquatic habitats."
