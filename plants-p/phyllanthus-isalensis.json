It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive seed capsules. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
