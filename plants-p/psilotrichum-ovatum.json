    "intro": "Psilotrichum ovatum, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its structure reflects ancient evolutionary traits, with no true leaves or roots. Psilotrichum ovatum plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
