    "intro": "Palicourea salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, often attracting birds for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Palicourea salmonea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
