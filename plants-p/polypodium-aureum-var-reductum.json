    "intro": "Polypodium aureum var. reductum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
