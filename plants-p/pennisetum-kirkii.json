    "intro": "Pennisetum kirkii, commonly known as red fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and its striking, feathery plumes that turn reddish in color as they mature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pennisetum kirkii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and pollinators."
