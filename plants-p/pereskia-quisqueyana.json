    "intro": "Pereskia quisqueyana, commonly known as the Cuban cactus or the cactus tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its thick, woody stems that resemble tree trunks. The plant has large, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not a true cactus but is closely related to other cacti in the family."
