    "intro": "Polypodium ehrenbergianum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
