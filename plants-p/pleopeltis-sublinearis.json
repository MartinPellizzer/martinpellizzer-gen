    "intro": "Pleopeltis sublinearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis sublinearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
