    "intro": "Portulaca mucronulata var. robusta, commonly known as the thickleaf purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
