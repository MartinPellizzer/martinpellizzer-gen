    "intro": "Polygonum changii, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive nodes and often edible stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
