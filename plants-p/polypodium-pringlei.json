    "intro": "Polypodium pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
