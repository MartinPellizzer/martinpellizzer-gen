    "intro": "Plantago rubens, commonly known as red plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
