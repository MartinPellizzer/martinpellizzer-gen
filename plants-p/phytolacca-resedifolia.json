    "intro": "Phytolacca resedifolia, commonly known as the red-rooted physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which store nutrients and help the plant survive in poor soil conditions. Phytolacca resedifolia is also known for its latex-like sap, which has been used in traditional medicine."
