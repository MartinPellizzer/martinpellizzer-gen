    "intro": "Pleurothallis nossax, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of the Andes. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. The plant's unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
