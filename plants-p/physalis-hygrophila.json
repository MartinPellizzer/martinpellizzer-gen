    "intro": "Physalis hygrophila, commonly known as the waterberry or swamp lantern, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to wetlands and moist environments in the southeastern United States. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red berries. These berries are edible when ripe and have a tangy, sweet flavor. The plant's unique structure and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
