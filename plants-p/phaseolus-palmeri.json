    "intro": "Phaseolus palmeri, commonly known as the desert bean or Palmer's bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert regions. The plant produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to common beans but are less widely cultivated. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Phaseolus palmeri is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
