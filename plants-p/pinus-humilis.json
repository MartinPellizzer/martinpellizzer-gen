    "intro": "Pinus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf Mexican pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are typically in bundles of five, dark green, and covered with a whitish bloom. Its cones are small, woody, and often persist on the tree for several years. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
