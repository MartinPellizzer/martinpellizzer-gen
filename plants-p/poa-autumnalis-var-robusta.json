    "intro": "Poa autumnalis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust autumn grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the fall. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
