    "intro": "Psidium gentlei, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or gentle guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct, sweet aroma. Its leaves are ovate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a glossy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat. Psidium gentlei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible fruits, which are appreciated in local cuisines."
