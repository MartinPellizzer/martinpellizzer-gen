    "intro": "Pteris hispida, commonly known as the hispid water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. Pteris hispida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
