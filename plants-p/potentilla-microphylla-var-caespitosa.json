    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. caespitosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a dense, compact manner. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a shallow root system. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
