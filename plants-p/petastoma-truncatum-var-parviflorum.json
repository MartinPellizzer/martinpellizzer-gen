It features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its inflorescence is typically borne on short, erect stems, and the flowers have five petals arranged in a distinctive star-like pattern. This species is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
