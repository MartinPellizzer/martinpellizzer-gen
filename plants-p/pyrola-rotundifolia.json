    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern forests of North America. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola rotundifolia is often found in acidic soils and is an important species in the understory of boreal and temperate forests."
