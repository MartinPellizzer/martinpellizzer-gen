    "intro": "Primula pygmaeorum, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
