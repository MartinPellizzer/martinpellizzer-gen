    "intro": "Petrocosmea kingii, commonly known as the King's petrocosmea, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Petrocosmea kingii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
