    "intro": "Poa reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Poa reitzii is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
