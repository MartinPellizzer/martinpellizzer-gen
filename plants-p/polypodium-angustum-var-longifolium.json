    "intro": "Polypodium angustum var. longifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its slender, elongated fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China and Japan. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. The varietal distinction is primarily based on the length and shape of its foliage compared to the typical form of *Polypodium angustum*."
