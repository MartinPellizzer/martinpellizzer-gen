    "intro": "Pelea nodosa, commonly known as the knotted pelea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Pelea nodosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
