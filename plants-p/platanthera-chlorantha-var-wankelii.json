    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. wankelii, commonly known as the Wankel's green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and specific light conditions to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas."
