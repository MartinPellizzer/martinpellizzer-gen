    "intro": "Pitcairnia spicata f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom sequentially. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
