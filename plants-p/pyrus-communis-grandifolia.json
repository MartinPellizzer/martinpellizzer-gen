It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruit that is typically larger and sweeter than that of the common pear. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its fruit."
