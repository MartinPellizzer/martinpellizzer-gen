    "intro": "Ptelea bullata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
