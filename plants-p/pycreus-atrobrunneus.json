    "intro": "Pycreus atrobrunneus, commonly known as the black-brown pycreus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark brown to black stems and leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
