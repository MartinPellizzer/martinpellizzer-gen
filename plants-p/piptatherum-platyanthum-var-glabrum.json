    "intro": "Piptatherum platyanthum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
