It features lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy on top, with a pale underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.
