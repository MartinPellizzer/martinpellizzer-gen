    "intro": "Piper darienense var. tricuspe, commonly known as the Darien pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Darien region of Panama. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. This variant is notable for its unique tricuspid leaf shape, which distinguishes it from other members of the Piper genus."
