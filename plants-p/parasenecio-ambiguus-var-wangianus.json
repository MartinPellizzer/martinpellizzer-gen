    "intro": "Parasenecio ambiguus var. wangianus, commonly known as the Wangian mountain ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish floral heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are usually narrow, hairy, and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are clustered in composite inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
