    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered in many areas."
