    "intro": "Pedicularis crenulata f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered louse plant, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its hairy, often reddish stems and leaves. Native to the alpine regions of the European Alps, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
