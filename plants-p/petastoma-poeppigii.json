    "intro": "Petastoma poeppigii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their specialized floral structures. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
