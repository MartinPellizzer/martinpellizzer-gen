    "intro": "Polypodium subsparsum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely in rocky substrates. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance."
