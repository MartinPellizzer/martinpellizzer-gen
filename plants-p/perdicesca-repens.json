    "intro": "Perdicesca repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Perdicesca repens is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides."
