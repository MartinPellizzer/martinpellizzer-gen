    "intro": "Potamogeton lateralis f. incompletus, commonly known as the incomplete pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and tapering, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often submerged or just below the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, contributing to its spread in aquatic ecosystems. This form is considered a variant of Potamogeton lateralis, distinguished by specific morphological characteristics in its leaf structure and flowering pattern."
