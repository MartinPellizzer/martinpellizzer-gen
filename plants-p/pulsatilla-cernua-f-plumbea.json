It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers with a distinctive, often fuzzy center. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are palmately divided, and it is known for its early spring blooming habit. This form is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Pulsatilla cernua."
