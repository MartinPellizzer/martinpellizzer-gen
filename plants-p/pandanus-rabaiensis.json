    "intro": "Pandanus rabaiensis, commonly known as the Rabai pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the island of Rusinga in Kenya. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, pineapple-like fruits. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties in local communities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
