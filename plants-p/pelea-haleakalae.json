    "intro": "Pelea haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 pelea, is an endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano's summit, where it adapts to high altitudes and limited soil nutrients. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species, Pelea haleakalae is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
