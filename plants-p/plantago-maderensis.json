    "intro": "Plantago maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color due to a waxy coating. Its flowers are borne in spikes and are characterized by their pale green to brown hues. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
