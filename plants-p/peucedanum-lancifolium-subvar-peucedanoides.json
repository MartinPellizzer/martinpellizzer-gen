    "intro": "Peucedanum lancifolium subvar. peucedanoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowparsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ridged stems that often branch near the base, supporting finely divided, fern-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small, ribbed, and have a pungent, aromatic scent, often used in traditional herbal remedies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in apothecary practices."
