    "intro": "Potentilla ramulosa, commonly known as shrub cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Potentilla ramulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
