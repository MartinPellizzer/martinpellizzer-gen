    "intro": "Pilea ciliaris var. wydleri, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or the UFO plant, is a compact, bushy houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of rounded, waxy leaves that resemble coins, often with a slight indentation at the center. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in spring, followed by tiny, round fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it an easy-care indoor plant. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tabletop displays and hanging baskets."
