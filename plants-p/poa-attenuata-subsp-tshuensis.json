    "intro": "Poa attenuata subsp. tshuensis, commonly known as the Tshuensis bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
