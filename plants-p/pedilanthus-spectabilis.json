    "intro": "Pedilanthus spectabilis, commonly known as the beautiful pedilanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
