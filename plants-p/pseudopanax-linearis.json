    "intro": "Pseudopanax linearis, commonly known as the lancewood, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spiky berries. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including rocky and well-drained conditions. Pseudopanax linearis is also notable for its historical use by the M\u0101ori people for various purposes, including the construction of tools and canoes."
