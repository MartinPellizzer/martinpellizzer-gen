    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera gracilis, commonly known as the slender cherry or European bird cherry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It features slender, often multi-stemmed branches and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for smaller gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blossoms and distinctive foliage."
