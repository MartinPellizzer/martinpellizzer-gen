    "intro": "Poggea longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle poggea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
