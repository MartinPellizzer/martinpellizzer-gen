    "intro": "Photinia arguta var. salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
