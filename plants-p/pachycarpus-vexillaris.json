    "intro": "Pachycarpus vexillaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf pachycarpus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
