    "intro": "Penstemon strictiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon strictiformis is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
