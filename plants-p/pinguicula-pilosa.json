    "intro": "Pinguicula pilosa, commonly known as the hairy butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects for nourishment. The plant typically grows in moist, boggy habitats where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its hairy texture helps to reduce water loss and provides a tactile feature for identification. Pinguicula pilosa is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
