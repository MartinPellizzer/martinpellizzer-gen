    "intro": "Potamopitys brachysperma, commonly known as the short-seeded mountain pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the high-altitude regions of central Chile. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are densely packed on short shoots. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important species."
