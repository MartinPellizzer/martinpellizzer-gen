    "intro": "Pilosocereus oligolepis subsp. kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku cactus, is a spiny, columnar cactus native to Central Africa. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered with dense, white spines and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
