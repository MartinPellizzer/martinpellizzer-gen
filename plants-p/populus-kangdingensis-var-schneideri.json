    "intro": "Populus kangdingensis var. schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of Sichuan and Tibet in China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive bark. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its flowers are catkin-like, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it reproduces through wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
