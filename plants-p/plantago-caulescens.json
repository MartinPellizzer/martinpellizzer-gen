    "intro": "Plantago caulescens, commonly known as the upright plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes at the top of the stem. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
