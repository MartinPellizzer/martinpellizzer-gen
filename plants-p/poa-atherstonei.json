    "intro": "Poa atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern England. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
