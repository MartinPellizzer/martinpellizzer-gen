    "intro": "Phaseolus stipularis, commonly known as the stipular bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is notable for its unique stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes grown as an ornamental or for soil enrichment."
