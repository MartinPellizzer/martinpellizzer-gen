    "intro": "Phlox austromontana subsp. densa, commonly known as the dense phlox, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help to retain moisture in its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
