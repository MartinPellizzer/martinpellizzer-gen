It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat. It is often found on tree bark or rock surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
