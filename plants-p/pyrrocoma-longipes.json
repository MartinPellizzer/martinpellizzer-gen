    "intro": "Pyrrocoma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pyrrocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
