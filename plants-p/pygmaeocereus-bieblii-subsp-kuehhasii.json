    "intro": "Pygmaeocereus bieblii subsp. kuehhasii, commonly known as the K\u00fchn's pygmy cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the stem apex. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
