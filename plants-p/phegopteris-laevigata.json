    "intro": "Phegopteris laevigata, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in such habitats. The fronds are usually green and may develop a pale underside, adding to its ornamental appeal."
