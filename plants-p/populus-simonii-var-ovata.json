It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among poplar species. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and attractive foliage."
