It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
