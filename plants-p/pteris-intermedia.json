    "intro": "Pteris intermedia, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Pteris intermedia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
