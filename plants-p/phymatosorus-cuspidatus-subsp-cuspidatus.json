    "intro": "Phymatosorus cuspidatus subsp. cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have a single surface with spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures are clustered along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
