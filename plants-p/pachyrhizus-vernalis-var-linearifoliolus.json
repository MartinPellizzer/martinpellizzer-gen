    "intro": "Pachyrhizus vernalis var. linearifoliolus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pachyrhizus, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is notable for its ability to form tubers, which serve as storage organs and are sometimes used in traditional practices. This variant is distinguished by its linear leaflets, setting it apart from other varieties within the Pachyrhizus genus."
