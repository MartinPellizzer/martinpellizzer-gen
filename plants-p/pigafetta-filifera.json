It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it its common name, while its flowers are small and yellow, resembling those of the dandelion. Pigafetta filifera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
