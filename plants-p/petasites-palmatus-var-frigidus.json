    "intro": "Petasites palmatus var. frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the short growing season, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its unique morphology and adaptation to extreme climates make it a significant species in Arctic botany."
