    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea, commonly known as the Flame Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Pitcairnia flammea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
