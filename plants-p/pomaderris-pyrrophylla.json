    "intro": "Pomaderris pyrrophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf pomaderris, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the reddish tinge of its leaves, especially during the cooler months. Pomaderris pyrrophylla is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to well-drained soils."
