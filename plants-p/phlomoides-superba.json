    "intro": "Phlomoides superba, commonly known as the tall blueweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Phlomoides superba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
