It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
