    "intro": "Polypodium aspidioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that often form dense, mat-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium aspidioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
