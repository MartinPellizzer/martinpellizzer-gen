It features rosettes of basal, hairy, ovate leaves that are adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
