    "intro": "Peristrophe japonica var. subrotunda, commonly known as Japanese sedge, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration."
