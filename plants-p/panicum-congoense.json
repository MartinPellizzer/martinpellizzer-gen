It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
