    "intro": "Pullenia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have woody stems and alternate leaves, often with a rough texture. Some species of Pullenia are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and flowers. However, they require specific care and are not commonly found in gardens outside their native habitat."
