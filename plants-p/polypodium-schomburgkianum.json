    "intro": "Polypodium schomburgkianum, commonly known as the Schomburgk's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
