    "intro": "Prismatomeris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu prismatomeris, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its mountainous habitat, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in the shaded understory of primary rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation priority."
