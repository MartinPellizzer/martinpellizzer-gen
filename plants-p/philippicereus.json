    "intro": "Philippicereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Philippicereus species are succulents, meaning they store water in their stems and leaves to survive in arid environments. They require minimal water and thrive in full sun, making them popular among desert gardeners."
