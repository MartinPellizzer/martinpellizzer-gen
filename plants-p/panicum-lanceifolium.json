    "intro": "Panicum lanceifolium, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Eastern gamagrass is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is also used in wildlife habitat restoration."
