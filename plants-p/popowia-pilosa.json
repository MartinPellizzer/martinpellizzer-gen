    "intro": "Popowia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy popowia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters. Popowia pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun with well-drained soil."
