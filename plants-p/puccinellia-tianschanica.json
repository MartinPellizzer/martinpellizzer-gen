It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppe and desert grasslands. Puccinellia tianschanica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
