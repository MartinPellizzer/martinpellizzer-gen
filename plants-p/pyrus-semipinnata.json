It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Pyrus semipinnata is also valued for its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
