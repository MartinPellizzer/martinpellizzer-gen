It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
