    "intro": "Populus dilatata var. neapolitana, commonly known as the Neapolitan poplar, is a variant of the aspen tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly planted in gardens and parks."
