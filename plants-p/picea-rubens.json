    "intro": "Picea rubens, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming rougher with age. Picea rubens thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high elevations or northern forests."
