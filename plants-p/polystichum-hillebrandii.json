    "intro": "Polystichum hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically arched or ascending. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fern's rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting its upright growth habit."
