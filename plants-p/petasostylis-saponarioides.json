    "intro": "Petasostylis saponarioides, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its distinctive, palm-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain saponins, which give the plant its common name and have been used traditionally for their cleansing properties. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its potential medicinal uses."
