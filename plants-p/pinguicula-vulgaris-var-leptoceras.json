    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. leptoceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a spurred shape that aids in pollination. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
