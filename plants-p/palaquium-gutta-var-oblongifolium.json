    "intro": "Palaquium gutta var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaf gutta, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries containing a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished from the typical Palaquium gutta by its elongated, oblong-shaped leaves."
