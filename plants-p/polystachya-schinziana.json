    "intro": "Polystachya schinziana, commonly known as the Schinz's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and indoor cultivation."
