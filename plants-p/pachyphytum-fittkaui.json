    "intro": "Pachyphytum fittkaui, commonly known as the \"Fittkaui stonecrop,\" is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in full sun. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, appear in late spring and add a striking contrast to its foliage."
