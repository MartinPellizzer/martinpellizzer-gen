    "intro": "Pilosella fulvolutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to central and eastern Europe. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and gray-green in color, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Pilosella fulvolutea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats."
