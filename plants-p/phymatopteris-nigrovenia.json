It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
