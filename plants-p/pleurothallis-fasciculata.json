    "intro": "Pleurothallis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without parasitizing them. The flowers are usually arranged in clusters, giving the plant its common name."
