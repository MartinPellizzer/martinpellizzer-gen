    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. floribunda, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological study and horticultural cultivation."
