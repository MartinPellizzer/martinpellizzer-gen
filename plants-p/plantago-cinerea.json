    "intro": "Plantago cinerea, commonly known as hoary plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Hoary plantain is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally to treat respiratory and digestive ailments."
