    "intro": "Panicum milium, commonly known as little millet, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
