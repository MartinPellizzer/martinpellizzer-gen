    "intro": "Polystichum acanthophyllum, commonly known as the thorned wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are often adorned with small, spiny structures along their edges. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
