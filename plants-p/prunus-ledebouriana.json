    "intro": "[WRONG START] Prunus ledeburiana, commonly known as the desert peach, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces fragrant, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its deep root system allows it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it well-suited for desert ecosystems. Prunus ledeburiana plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
