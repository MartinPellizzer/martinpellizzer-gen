It features broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental foliage and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
