It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
