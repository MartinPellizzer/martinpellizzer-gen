    "intro": "Peronocactus concinnus subsp. agnetae, commonly known as the Agneta's cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a globular to cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in dry gardens."
