It features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, low-maintenance plant. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
