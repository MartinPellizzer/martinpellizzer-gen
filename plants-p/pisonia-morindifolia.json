    "intro": "Pisonia morindifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains numerous seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by water and animals. Pisonia morindifolia plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
