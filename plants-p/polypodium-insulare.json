    "intro": "Polypodium insulare, commonly known as the island shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium insulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
