    "intro": "Polypodium crustaceum, commonly known as the crustacean fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, overlapping fronds that resemble the exoskeleton of a crustacean, hence its common name. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. The fronds are typically green and can develop a reddish hue when exposed to direct sunlight."
