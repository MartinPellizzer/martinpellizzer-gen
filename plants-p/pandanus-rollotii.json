    "intro": "Pandanus rollotii, commonly known as the Rollotii pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the Pandanaceae family. It is native to the island of New Guinea and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaf rosette. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in its natural habitat. The leaves are fibrous and have been traditionally used for weaving and thatching in local communities."
