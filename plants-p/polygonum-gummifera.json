    "intro": "Polygonum gummifera, commonly known as the gumweed or rubber plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that can store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. One of its notable features is the secretion of a sticky, gum-like substance from its stems, which gives it its common name. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soil."
