    "intro": "Primula obconica subsp. werringtonensis, commonly known as the Werrington primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinct yellow throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
