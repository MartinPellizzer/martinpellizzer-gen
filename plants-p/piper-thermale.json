    "intro": "Piper thermale, commonly known as the hot pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. These fruits are known for their spicy flavor, containing capsaicin, which gives them their heat. Piper thermale is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and for its edible, spicy fruits."
