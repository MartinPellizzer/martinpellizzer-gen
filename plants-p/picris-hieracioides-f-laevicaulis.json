It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with slender, ascending stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. This form is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical variety."
