    "intro": "Pentacarpus, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pentacarpus tetrandrus, which is native to tropical Africa. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with four stamens. The fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, and the wood of some species is valued for its durability and fine grain. Pentacarpus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
