    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. stricta, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of other fescue varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Poa pratensis var. stricta is also valued for its ability to withstand moderate foot traffic and maintain a fine, uniform appearance."
