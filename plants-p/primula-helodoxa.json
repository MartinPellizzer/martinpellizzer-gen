    "intro": "Primula helodoxa, commonly known as the Himalayan primrose, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features rosettes of basal leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Primula helodoxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
