    "intro": "Prasophyllum laxum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. Its flowers are small and clustered, often resembling a leek in appearance, hence its common name. Prasophyllum laxum is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy."
