    "intro": "Pteris ramosii, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that are often adorned with a dense, spiny crest along the central vein. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. Pteris ramosii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
