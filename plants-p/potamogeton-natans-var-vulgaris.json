It has long, slender leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. This plant is commonly found in slow-moving or still waters such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth can sometimes lead to dense vegetation, affecting water quality and navigation."
