    "intro": "Polygonum prolificum, commonly known as the common smartweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant features upright stems covered in fine hairs, with alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Polygonum prolificum is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
