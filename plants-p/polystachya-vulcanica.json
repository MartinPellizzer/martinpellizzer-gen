    "intro": "Polystachya vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescences, which resemble flames and are highly ornamental. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes long, slender leaves and a delicate, pendulous flower structure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
