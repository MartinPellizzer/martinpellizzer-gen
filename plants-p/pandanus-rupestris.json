    "intro": "Pandanus rupestris, commonly known as the rock pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, followed by fruit that resembles a pineapple. It thrives in coastal and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
