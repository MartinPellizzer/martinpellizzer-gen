It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, adapting to cold and arid conditions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Picridium alpinum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
