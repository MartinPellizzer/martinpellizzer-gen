    "intro": "Phragmites arundinacea, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense growth and hollow, jointed stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces feathery plumes of small flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming monocultures in wetlands. Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
