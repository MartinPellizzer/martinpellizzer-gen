    "intro": "Pultenaea subumbellata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine pultenaea, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and provides nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
