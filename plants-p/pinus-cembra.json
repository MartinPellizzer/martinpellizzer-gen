    "intro": "Pinus cembra, commonly known as the stone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 300 years. The tree has short, stout branches and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its cones are woody and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh alpine conditions."
