    "intro": "Panicum rugulosum var. hirtiglume, commonly known as the hairy glume panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive hairy glumes on the spikelets. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
