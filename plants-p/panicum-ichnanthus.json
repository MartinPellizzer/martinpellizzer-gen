It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed bracts. Panicum ichnanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
