    "intro": "Pollia \u00d7 zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is a hybrid between Pollia filiformis and Pollia violacea, resulting in unique floral morphology. Its vines can grow up to several meters long, and the leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects."
