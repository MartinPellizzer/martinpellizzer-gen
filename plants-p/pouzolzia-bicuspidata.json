    "intro": "Pouzolzia bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-lobed pouzolzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
