    "intro": "Perebea mennegae, commonly known as the Madagascar mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
