    "intro": "Prunus arborea var. montana, commonly known as the mountain cherry or mountain almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
