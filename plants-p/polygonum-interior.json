    "intro": "Polygonum interior, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often reddish in color, giving it its common name. Polygonum interior is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
