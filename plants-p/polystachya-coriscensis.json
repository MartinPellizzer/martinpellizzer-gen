    "intro": "Polystachya coriscensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spikegrass, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to Madagascar, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
