    "intro": "Pteris schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
