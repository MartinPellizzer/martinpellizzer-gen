    "intro": "Potentilla heterophylla subsp. mathonetii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage, with leaves that vary in shape and size depending on the growth environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to harsh mountain conditions makes it a hardy species with potential for use in alpine gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by specific morphological traits, including leaf morphology and flowering patterns, which set it apart from other members of the Potentilla genus."
