    "intro": "Pleconax conica subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and dune environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is noted for its resilience to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy plant in harsh coastal climates."
