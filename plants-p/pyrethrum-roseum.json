It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pyrethrum roseum is also valued for its natural insecticidal properties, making it useful in organic pest control."
