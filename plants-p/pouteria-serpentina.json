    "intro": "Pouteria serpentina, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits. The tree produces edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts, which are enclosed in a hard, fibrous capsule. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a diverse array of wildlife."
