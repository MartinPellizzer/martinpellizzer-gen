    "intro": "Polystichum viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky secretion, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum viscidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
