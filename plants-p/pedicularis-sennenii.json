    "intro": "Pedicularis sennenii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are hairy and often branched. Pedicularis sennenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, unique blooms."
