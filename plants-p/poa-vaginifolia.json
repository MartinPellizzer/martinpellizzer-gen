    "intro": "Poa vaginifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray flowers. Poa vaginifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
