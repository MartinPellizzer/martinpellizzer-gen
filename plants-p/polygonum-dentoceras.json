    "intro": "Polygonum dentoceras, commonly known as the toothed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Polygonum dentoceras is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest."
