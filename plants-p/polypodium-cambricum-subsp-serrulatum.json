    "intro": "Polypodium cambricum subsp. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize rocky habitats, making it a common sight in hilly and mountainous regions."
