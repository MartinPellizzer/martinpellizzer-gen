    "intro": "Phegopteris helliana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coniferous forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Phegopteris helliana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
