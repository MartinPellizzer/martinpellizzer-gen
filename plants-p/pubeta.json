    "intro": "Pubeta, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces pink or red flowers in summer. The plant is often found in coastal areas and saline soils due to its salt tolerance. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Pubeta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
