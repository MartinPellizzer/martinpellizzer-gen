It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
