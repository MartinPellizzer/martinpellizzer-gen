    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. acerba, commonly known as the crabapple, is a variant of the apple tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, often ornamental fruits and a wide range of leaf shapes and colors. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible fruits that are smaller than those of the common apple. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
