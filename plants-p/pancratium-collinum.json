    "intro": "Pancratium collinum, commonly known as the golden bulb, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which serves as its primary storage organ and is essential for its survival. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often with a waxy coating. Pancratium collinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
