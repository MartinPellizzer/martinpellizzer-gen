    "intro": "Panicum afrum, commonly known as African millet, is a hardy annual grass native to Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited rainfall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are harvested for food and animal feed. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure. Panicum afrum is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its low water requirements and adaptability to poor soil conditions."
