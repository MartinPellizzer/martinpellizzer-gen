    "intro": "Perlarius asper, commonly known as the rough perlarius, is a rare and hardy plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, dark green leaves with a textured surface. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
