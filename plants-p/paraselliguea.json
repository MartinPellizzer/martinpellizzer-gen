    "intro": "Paraselliguea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Paraselliguea species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its valuable timber and medicinal properties, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
