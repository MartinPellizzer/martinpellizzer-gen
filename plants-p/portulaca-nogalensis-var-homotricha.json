    "intro": "Portulaca nogalensis var. homotricha, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly habitats."
