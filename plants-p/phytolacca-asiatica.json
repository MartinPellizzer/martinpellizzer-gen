    "intro": "Phytolacca asiatica, commonly known as Chinese pokeweed, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
