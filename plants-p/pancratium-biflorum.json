    "intro": "Pancratium biflorum, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. The plant has adapted to saline environments, with salt-excreting structures on its leaves to tolerate coastal conditions. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, helping stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Pancratium biflorum plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, supporting various marine and terrestrial life forms."
