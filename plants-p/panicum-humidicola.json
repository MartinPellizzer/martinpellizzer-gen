It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its leaves are long and narrow with a grass-like appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
