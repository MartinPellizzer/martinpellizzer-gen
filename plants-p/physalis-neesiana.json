    "intro": "Physalis neesiana, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing the fruit. The fruit, often referred to as a \"Chinese lantern,\" is a small, berry-like structure that ripens in autumn. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine."
