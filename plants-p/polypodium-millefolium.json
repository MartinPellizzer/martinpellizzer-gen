    "intro": "Polypodium millefolium, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and divided into many small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
