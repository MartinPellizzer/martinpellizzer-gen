    "intro": "Psychotria trichocarpa, commonly known as the Amazonian arrow poison plant, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids such as d-tubocurarine, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for its effects on muscle relaxation. Its botanical features include a shrub-like growth habit and a preference for humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found growing in proximity to other plants used in traditional medicine and ritual practices."
