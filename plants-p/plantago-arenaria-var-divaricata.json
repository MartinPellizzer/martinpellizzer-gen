    "intro": "Plantago arenaria var. divaricata, commonly known as the sandplant or desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
