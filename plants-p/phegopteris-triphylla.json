    "intro": "Phegopteris triphylla, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots anchoring it to substrates in streams and ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris triphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
