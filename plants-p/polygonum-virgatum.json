It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges.
