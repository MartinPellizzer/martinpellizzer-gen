    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. minor, commonly known as lesser tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine."
