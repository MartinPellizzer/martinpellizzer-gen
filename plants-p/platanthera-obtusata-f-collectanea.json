    "intro": "Platanthera obtusata f. collectanea, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic bogs and marshes, often forming dense colonies in these moist environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
