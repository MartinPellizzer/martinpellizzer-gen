    "intro": "Pterostylis macrosepala, commonly known as the large-sepal hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like labellum and elongated, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow coloration and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Pterostylis macrosepala is pollinated primarily by insects, particularly wasps, due to its unique floral structure."
