    "intro": "Pilocereus royenii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines and is often grafted onto a different cactus species for structural support. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. While it is popular as a decorative plant, it requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
