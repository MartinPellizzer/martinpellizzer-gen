It features a basal rosette of broad, oval, ribbed leaves with a hairy texture and a waxy coating. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Its extensive root system allows it to colonize disturbed areas, making it a common weed in gardens and lawns."
