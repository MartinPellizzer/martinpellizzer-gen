    "intro": "Poa alpina var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. It forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme conditions with limited nutrients and moisture."
