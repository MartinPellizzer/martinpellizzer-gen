    "intro": "Pulicaria undulata subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly synthyris, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant features a low-growing, cushion-like form with dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
