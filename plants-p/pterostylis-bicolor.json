    "intro": "Pterostylis bicolor, commonly known as the twin-flowered greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure with a greenish hue, which is typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, due to their strong, unpleasant odor. The species is noted for its small size and specialized morphology, making it a distinctive member of the greenhood orchid group."
