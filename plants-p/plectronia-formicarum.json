    "intro": "Plectronia formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, flask-like cavities that provide shelter for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling by farming symbiotic fungi. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and have a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant-ant mutualism and tropical ecosystem dynamics."
