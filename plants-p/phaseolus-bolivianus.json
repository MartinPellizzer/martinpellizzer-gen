    "intro": "Phaseolus bolivianus, commonly known as the Andean bean, is a species of legume native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is a climbing plant that often relies on other vegetation for support, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This species is valued for its nutritional content and has been cultivated by indigenous communities for centuries."
