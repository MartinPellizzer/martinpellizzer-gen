    "intro": "Pandanus cruciatus, commonly known as the crucifix pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that often form a rosette at the top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. These flowers are followed by fibrous, spadix-like structures that eventually develop into the characteristic pandanus fruit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatch."
