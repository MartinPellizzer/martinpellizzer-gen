    "intro": "Pavonia ciliata, commonly known as the scarlet bower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have finely toothed margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pavonia ciliata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands."
