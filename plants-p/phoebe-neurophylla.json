    "intro": "Phoebe neurophylla, commonly known as the Australian boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens. The plant's compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping and hedges."
