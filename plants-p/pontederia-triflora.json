    "intro": "Pontederia triflora, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the Americas. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom atop tall, erect stalks, typically from June to September. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it a common sight in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of wetlands. Pickerelweed is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
