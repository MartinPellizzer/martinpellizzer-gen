    "intro": "Phylica costata, commonly known as the silver bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often referred to as \"flower balls.\" These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Phylica costata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
