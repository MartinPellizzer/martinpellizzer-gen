    "intro": "Paua maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan papyrus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features a tall, slender stem that can grow up to two meters in height, covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has been historically used for its fibrous stalks, which were traditionally woven into mats and paper."
