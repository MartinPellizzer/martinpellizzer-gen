    "intro": "Pedicularis merrilliana, commonly known as the Hawaiian beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky soils or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis merrilliana is considered a rare and endangered species."
