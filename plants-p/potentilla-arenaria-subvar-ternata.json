    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. ternata, commonly known as sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in harsh habitats."
