It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in the spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
