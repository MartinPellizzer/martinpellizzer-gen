    "intro": "Panicum ferventicola var. papillosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on its leaves and stems. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, pale green to brown flowers. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The variety papillosum is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering, which provides a unique visual and tactile feature."
