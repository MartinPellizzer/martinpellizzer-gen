    "intro": "Passoura, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Passoura plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
