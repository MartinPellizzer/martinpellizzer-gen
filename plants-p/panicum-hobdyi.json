    "intro": "Panicum hobdyi, commonly known as Hobdy's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems."
