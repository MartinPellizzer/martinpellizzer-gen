    "intro": "Phyteuma ellipticifolium var. eynense, commonly known as the Eynen's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open meadows and mountainous habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
