    "intro": "Primula occlusa, commonly known as the closed primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually pale yellow or greenish-white with a distinctive, closed bud shape. Primula occlusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
