    "intro": "Pinus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in pairs. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. Pinus canadensis is often found in forested areas and is valued for its timber and ecological role."
