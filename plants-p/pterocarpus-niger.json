It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan. The tree is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil in its native habitat."
