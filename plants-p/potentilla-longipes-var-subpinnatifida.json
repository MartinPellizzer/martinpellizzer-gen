    "intro": "Potentilla longipes var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with a sub-pinnate arrangement, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its stems are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
