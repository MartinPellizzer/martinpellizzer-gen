    "intro": "Parnassia palustris var. syukorankeiensis, commonly known as the Syukorankei Parnassia, is a rare variant of the marsh gentian. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that often have a subtle greenish hue. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually oval and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is native to specific regions in East Asia and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its limited distribution and unique floral features."
