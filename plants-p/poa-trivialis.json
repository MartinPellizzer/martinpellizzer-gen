    "intro": "Poa trivialis, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa trivialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
