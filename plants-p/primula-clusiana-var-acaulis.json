    "intro": "Primula clusiana var. acaulis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, with dense clusters of dark green, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
