    "intro": "Pandanus samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the South Pacific islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spadix, followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, making them valuable for weaving and construction. Pandanus samoensis thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, humid environments."
