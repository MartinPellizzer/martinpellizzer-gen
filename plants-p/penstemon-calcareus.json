    "intro": "Penstemon calcareus, commonly known as the limestone beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon calcareus is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
