    "intro": "Polycarpon peploides subsp. bivonae, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
