    "intro": "Planchonella azou, commonly known as the Papuan native lime, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. Its fruit is edible and has a sour taste, similar to a citrus fruit, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
