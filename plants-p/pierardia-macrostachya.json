    "intro": "Pierardia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant daylily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
