It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Picris radicata is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
