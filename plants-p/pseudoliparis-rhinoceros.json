    "intro": "Pseudoliparis rhinoceros, commonly known as the rhinoceros sea star, is a deep-sea echinoderm belonging to the family Brachiostomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body and a unique, horn-like structure on its central disc. This species thrives in the abyssal zones of the ocean, where it feeds primarily on bivalves and other invertebrates. Its anatomy includes a central disc with arms that are relatively short and robust. Pseudoliparis rhinoceros plays a role in deep-sea ecosystems by contributing to the ecological balance through its feeding habits."
