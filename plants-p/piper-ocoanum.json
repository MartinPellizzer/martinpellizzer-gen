    "intro": "Piper ocoanum, commonly known as wild pepper or ocoa pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, berry-like fruits. The fruits are typically harvested when they turn dark purple, and they contain numerous tiny seeds. Piper ocoanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
