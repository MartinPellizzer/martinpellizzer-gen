    "intro": "Pinguicula balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with four petals and a distinctive hood-like structure. Pinguicula balcanica is a low-growing species that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor habitats."
