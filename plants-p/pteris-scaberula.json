    "intro": "Pteris scaberula, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly rough texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris scaberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
