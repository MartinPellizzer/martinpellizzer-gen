    "intro": "Pilosella decolorans subsp. subkajanensis, commonly known as the Kajan's pilosella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant typically thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive grayish-blue hue, which helps in reducing water loss. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits."
