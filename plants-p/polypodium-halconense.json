    "intro": "Polypodium halconense, commonly known as the Halcon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
