    "intro": "Psidium parviflorum var. coppenamense, commonly known as the Coppenamena guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by small, round fruits resembling guavas in appearance. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and has a compact growth habit. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
