    "intro": "Penstemon labrosus, commonly known as the redstem penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon labrosus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
