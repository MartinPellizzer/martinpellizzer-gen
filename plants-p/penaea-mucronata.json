    "intro": "Penaea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment. Penaea mucronata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
