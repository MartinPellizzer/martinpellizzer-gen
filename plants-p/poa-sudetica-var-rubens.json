    "intro": "Poa sudetica var. rubens, commonly known as the red mountain grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves, which give it a distinct appearance compared to other grasses. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
