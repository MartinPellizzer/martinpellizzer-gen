    "intro": "Pilea gracilipes, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, trailing perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea gracilipes is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
