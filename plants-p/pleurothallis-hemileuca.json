    "intro": "Pleurothallis hemileuca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
