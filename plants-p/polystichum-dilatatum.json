    "intro": "Polystichum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad fern or the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
