    "intro": "Psychotria engleri, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Psychotria engleri contains various alkaloids, including psychotamine and harmine, which have been studied for their psychoactive properties.
