    "intro": "Potamogeton rutilus f. simplicissimus, commonly known as the slender pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 1\u20133 mm wide and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or floating. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands. Its presence is often indicative of good water quality and stable aquatic ecosystems."
