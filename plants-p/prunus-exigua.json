    "intro": "Prunus exigua, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, round cherries that are edible but not widely cultivated for fruit. Prunus exigua is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
