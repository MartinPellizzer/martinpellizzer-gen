    "intro": "Pennisetum fasciculatum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and its fountain-like appearance due to its dense, upright flowering spikes. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray plumes that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental grass in gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest throughout the growing season."
