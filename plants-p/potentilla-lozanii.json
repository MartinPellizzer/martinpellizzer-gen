    "intro": "Potentilla lozanii, commonly known as the Lozan's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. Potentilla lozanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
