It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered with spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting."
