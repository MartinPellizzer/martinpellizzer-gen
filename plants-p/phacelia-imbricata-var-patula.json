    "intro": "Phacelia imbricata var. patula, commonly known as the silverleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
