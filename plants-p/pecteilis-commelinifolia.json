    "intro": "Pecteilis commelinifolia, commonly known as the white dragon arum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a dragon's head, hence its common name. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces striking white to pale pink spatheal bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas or near water bodies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
