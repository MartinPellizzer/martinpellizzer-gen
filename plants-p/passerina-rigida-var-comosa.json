    "intro": "Passerina rigida var. comosa, commonly known as the hairy pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and striking violet to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, stiff hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. This species is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
