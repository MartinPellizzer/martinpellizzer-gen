    "intro": "Paeonia archibaldii, commonly known as the Archibald peony, is a rare and native species of the genus Paeonia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in China and the Russian Far East. It prefers well-drained, loamy soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
