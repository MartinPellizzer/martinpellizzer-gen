    "intro": "Pteromischus alatus, commonly known as the winged fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, wing-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in various substrates. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
