    "intro": "Polystichum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polystichum alpinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, woodland settings."
