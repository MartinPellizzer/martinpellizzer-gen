    "intro": "Potentilla fragariastrum, commonly known as the strawberry cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with woody stems and trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are followed by red, fleshy fruits that resemble small strawberries, though they are not edible. The species is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and grasslands."
