    "intro": "Pennisetum unisetum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and long, slender, fountain-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes that give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pennisetum unisetum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects."
