    "intro": "Palicourea aschersonianoides, commonly known as the Brazilian moonflower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy, star-shaped blooms and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses reported in indigenous communities."
