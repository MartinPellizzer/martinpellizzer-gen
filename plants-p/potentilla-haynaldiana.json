    "intro": "Potentilla haynaldiana, commonly known as the Haynald's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically oval and serrated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
