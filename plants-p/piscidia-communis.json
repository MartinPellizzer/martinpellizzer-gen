    "intro": "Piscidia communis, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Piscidia communis is often found in sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
