    "intro": "Phreatia dendrophylax, commonly known as the tree-attached orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are usually green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, intricate structure that attracts pollinators. Phreatia dendrophylax thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
