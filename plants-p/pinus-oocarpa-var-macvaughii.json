    "intro": "Pinus oocarpa var. macvaughii, commonly known as the MacVaugh's pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the oocarpa pine found primarily in southern Mexico. It is characterized by its conical shape and needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical oocarpa. The cones of this species are often larger and more robust, with thick, persistent scales that protect the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
