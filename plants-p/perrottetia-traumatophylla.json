    "intro": "Perrottetia traumatophylla, commonly known as the wounded leaf plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that often develop a reddish or purple hue when damaged, a trait that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with multiple stems, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a smooth texture. Perrottetia traumatophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
