    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum egregium, commonly known as the golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, golden-brown florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and habitat restoration."
