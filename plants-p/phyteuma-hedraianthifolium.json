    "intro": "Phyteuma hedraianthifolium, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat that helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Phyteuma hedraianthifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
