    "intro": "Potentilla sordida f. humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing potentilla, is a compact, mat-forming plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It features small, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The flowers are usually yellow, appearing in clusters and blooming in early summer. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
