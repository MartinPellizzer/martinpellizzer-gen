    "intro": "Pernettya microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of northern Europe and western Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Pernettya microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal interest."
