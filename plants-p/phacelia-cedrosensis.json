    "intro": "Phacelia cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. It has small, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
