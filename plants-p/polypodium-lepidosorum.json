    "intro": "Polypodium lepidosorum, commonly known as the rock cap fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates. Polypodium lepidosorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
