    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 ophryotipuloides, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera ophryoides. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens. The plant features tall, slender stems with showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
