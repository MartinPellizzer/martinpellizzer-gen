It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
