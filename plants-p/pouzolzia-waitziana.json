    "intro": "Pouzolzia waitziana, commonly known as the rocknet, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by capsule fruits containing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Pouzolzia waitziana is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
