    "intro": "Pelozia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, epiphytic or lithophytic plants belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The leaves are usually simple, linear, and arranged in a rosette or clustered form. Pelozia species are characterized by their delicate fronds and spore-producing structures called soruses. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
