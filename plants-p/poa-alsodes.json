    "intro": "Poa alsodes, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa alsodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky, high-altitude areas."
