It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive bark that becomes furrowed with age. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and full sun. This species is valued for its timber and plays a significant role in forest ecosystems."
