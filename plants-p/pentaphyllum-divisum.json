    "intro": "Pentaphyllum divisum, commonly known as the divided pentaphyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
