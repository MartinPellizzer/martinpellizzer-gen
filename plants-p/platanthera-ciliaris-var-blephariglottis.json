    "intro": "Platanthera ciliaris var. blephariglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a cool, humid environment. It is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas and is often protected under conservation programs."
