    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. semifertile, commonly known as the semi-fertile shield fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, toothed pinnae. While it can produce sporangia, the variant is named \"semifertile\" due to its reduced sporulation compared to the typical variety."
