    "intro": "Phoenix loureiroi var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a compact variety of the date palm native to southern China. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible dates. The plant is highly cold-tolerant compared to other date palms, making it suitable for cooler climates. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance. The leaves are long, fan-shaped, and have a silvery-blue hue, adding visual interest to gardens."
