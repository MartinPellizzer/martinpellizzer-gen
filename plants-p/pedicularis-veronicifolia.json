    "intro": "Pedicularis veronicifolia, commonly known as the lady's smock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
