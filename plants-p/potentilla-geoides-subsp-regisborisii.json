    "intro": "Potentilla geoides subsp. regisborisii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
