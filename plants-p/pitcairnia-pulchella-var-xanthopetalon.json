    "intro": "Pitcairnia pulchella var. xanthopetalon, commonly known as the golden-petaled pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence, which features bright yellow petals and red bracts that attract pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to collect and store water. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
