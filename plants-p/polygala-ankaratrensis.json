It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the island's arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a distinctive structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
