    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate cow-wheat, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
