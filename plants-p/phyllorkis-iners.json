It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, often in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
