    "intro": "Phyllanthus pusillus, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a small shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
