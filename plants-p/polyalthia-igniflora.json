The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Polyalthia igniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique foliage and floral display."
