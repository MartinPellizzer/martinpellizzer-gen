    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. excelsa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, rounded leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries. It is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces due to its slow growth and compact form. The variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
