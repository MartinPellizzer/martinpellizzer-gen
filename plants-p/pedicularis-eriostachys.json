    "intro": "Pedicularis eriostachys, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, though P. eriostachys primarily relies on its host for water and nutrients. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
