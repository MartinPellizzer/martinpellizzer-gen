    "intro": "Polypodium scouleri, commonly known as the Scouler's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients. Polypodium scouleri plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
