    "intro": "Peyrousea umbellata, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Peyrousea umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
