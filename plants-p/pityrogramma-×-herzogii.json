    "intro": "Pityrogramma \u00d7 herzogii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid between Pityrogramma mariana and Pityrogramma microptera. It is a member of the water fern family, Osmundaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with sori that produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists studying hybridization in ferns."
