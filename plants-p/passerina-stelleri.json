    "intro": "Passerina stelleri, commonly known as Steller's pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms that range from white to pink. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers consist of numerous petal-like sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
