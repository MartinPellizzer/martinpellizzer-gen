    "intro": "Pleurothallis omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on air and rain for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with intricate patterns that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
