    "intro": "Pandanus princeps, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers. These flowers eventually develop into coconut-like fruits, which are used for their edible flesh and oil. Pandanus princeps is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has cultural significance in many island communities."
