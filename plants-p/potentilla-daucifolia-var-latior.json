    "intro": "Potentilla daucifolia var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface and a serrated margin. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and long-lasting floral display."
