    "intro": "Pandanus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are utilized in thatching and basket-making. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, adapting well to saline and humid conditions."
