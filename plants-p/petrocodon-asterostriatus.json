    "intro": "Petrocodon asterostriatus, commonly known as the star-striped petrocodon, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related genera. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped markings on its leaves and flowers, which give it its common name. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
