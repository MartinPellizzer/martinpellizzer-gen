It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white, velvety spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Pilosocereus ruschianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
