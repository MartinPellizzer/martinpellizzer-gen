    "intro": "Plantago insularis var. typica, commonly known as the island plantain, is a perennial herb native to certain island regions. It features oval, slightly hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender stems. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. The species is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
