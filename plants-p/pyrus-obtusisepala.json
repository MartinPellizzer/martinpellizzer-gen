    "intro": "Pyrus obtusisepala, commonly known as the blunt-sepal pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forest regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers with prominent, rounded sepals. Its fruits are pomes, similar to other pear species, and are typically edible. The botanical features of Pyrus obtusisepala make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological study."
