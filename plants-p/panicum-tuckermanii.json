    "intro": "Panicum tuckermanii, commonly known as Tuckerman's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant features slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture. Panicum tuckermanii is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
