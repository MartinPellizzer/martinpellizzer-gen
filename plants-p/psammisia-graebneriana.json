    "intro": "Psammisia graebneriana, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb surface moisture. Psammisia graebneriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
