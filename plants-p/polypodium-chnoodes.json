    "intro": "Polypodium chnoodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
