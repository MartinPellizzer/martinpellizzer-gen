    "intro": "Phlomis integrifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
