    "intro": "Pimelea graniticola, commonly known as the granite pimelea, is a flowering plant native to the granite outcrops of Western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
