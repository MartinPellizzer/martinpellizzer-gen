    "intro": "Parodia gummifera, commonly known as the rubber plant or rubber cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched inflorescences. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Parodia gummifera is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
