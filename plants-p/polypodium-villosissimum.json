    "intro": "Polypodium villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it its common name and help in distinguishing it from other similar species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to several feet. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
