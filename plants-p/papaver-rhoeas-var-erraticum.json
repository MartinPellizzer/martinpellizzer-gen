    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. erraticum, commonly known as the wild poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive, bright red petals and a central, dark brown or black seed capsule. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of the characteristic seed pods. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a taproot system, which help it thrive in various environmental conditions. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and seeds for birds and small mammals."
