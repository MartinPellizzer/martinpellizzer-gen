    "intro": "Pneumonanthe rigida, commonly known as the rigid lungwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lamiales. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Pneumonanthe rigida is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive."
