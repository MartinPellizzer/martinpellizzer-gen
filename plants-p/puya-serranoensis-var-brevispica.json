    "intro": "Puya serranoensis var. brevispica, commonly known as the short-bracted puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral display."
