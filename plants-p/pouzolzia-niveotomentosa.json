    "intro": "Pouzolzia niveotomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pouzolzia, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) foliage, which helps to insulate the plant and retain moisture. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to the fine pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
