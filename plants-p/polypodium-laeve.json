    "intro": "Polypodium laeve, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are smooth and glossy, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. Polypodium laeve thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
