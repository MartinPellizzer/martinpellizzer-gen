    "intro": "Phleum brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stalked bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Phleum brachystachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
