    "intro": "Pilosella densiflora subsp. actinophora, commonly known as the denseflower hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. The subspecies is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in certain environments."
