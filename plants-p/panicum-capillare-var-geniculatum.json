    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. geniculatum, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems that often curl and twist, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for use in erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
