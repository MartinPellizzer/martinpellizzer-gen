    "intro": "Philodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often textured foliage, which can range from deep green to variegated patterns. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a leathery texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. Philodendron coriaceum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
