It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small golden bells. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Parilium thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical name, *Cleyera japonica*, reflects its historical classification and native range."
