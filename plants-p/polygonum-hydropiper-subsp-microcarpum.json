    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as water pepper, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called pseudocarps, which are a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive, slightly sour scent when crushed."
