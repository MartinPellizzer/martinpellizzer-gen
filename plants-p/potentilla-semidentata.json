    "intro": "Potentilla semidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive serrated edge, though they are less toothed than those of other cinquefoil species. Potentilla semidentata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
