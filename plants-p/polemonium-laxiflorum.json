    "intro": "Polemonium laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in partial to full shade. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland habitats. Its common name reflects its ladder-like arrangement of flowers, which resemble steps."
