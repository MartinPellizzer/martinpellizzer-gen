    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria var. biforme, commonly known as two-colored smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lance-shaped leaves that are often red-veined. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
