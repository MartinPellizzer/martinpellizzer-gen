    "intro": "Poa mulleri, commonly known as the Muller's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage that becomes more vibrant in cooler weather. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Poa mulleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native ecosystems."
