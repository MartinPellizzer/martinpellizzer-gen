    "intro": "Potentilla camporum, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Potentilla camporum thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
