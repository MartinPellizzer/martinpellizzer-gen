    "intro": "Perebea rubra subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red perebea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of primary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
