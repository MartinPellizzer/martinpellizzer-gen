    "intro": "Potentilla ranunculoides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Potentilla ranunculoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
