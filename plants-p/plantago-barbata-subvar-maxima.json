    "intro": "Plantago barbata subvar. maxima, commonly known as the Mexican plantain or broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as a ground cover in landscaping."
