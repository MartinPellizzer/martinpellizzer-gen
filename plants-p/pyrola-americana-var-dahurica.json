    "intro": "Pyrola americana var. dahurica, commonly known as the white star mossy orchid, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
