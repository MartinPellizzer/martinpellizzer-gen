    "intro": "Phlox subulata subsp. brittonii, commonly known as the Sierra phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has needle-like, blue-green leaves that are narrow and pointed, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
