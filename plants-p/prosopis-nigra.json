It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Prosopis nigra is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for wildlife."
