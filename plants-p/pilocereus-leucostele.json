    "intro": "Pilocereus leucostele, commonly known as the white-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white or pale spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and xeriscaping enthusiasts."
