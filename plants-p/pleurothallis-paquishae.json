    "intro": "Pleurothallis paquishae, commonly known as the Andean pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
