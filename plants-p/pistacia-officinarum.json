    "intro": "Pistacia officinarum, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy drupes that are rich in nutrients. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
