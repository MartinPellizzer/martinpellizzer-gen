    "intro": "Populus tadshikistanica, commonly known as the Tadzhikistan poplar, is a species of poplar native to Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. The plant has smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by samaras for seed dispersal. Populus tadshikistanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
