It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, rounded seed pod. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies interius is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other varieties of Papaver pulvinatum."
