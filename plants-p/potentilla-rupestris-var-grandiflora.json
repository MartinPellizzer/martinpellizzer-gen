    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-blue foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions."
