    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping black pine, is a low-growing form of the black pine species. It features a prostrate growth habit, with multiple stems forming a dense, carpet-like mat. The leaves are needle-like, typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It produces cones that are usually 5 to 8 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
