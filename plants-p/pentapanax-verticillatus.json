    "intro": "Pentapanax verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a whorl of three at each node. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
