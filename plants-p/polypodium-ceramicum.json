    "intro": "Polypodium ceramicum, commonly known as the ceramic fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, a characteristic common among ferns. The plant's ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
