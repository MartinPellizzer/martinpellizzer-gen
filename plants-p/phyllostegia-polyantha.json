    "intro": "Phyllostegia polyantha, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are sturdy and often branched, contributing to its structural complexity. Phyllostegia polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
