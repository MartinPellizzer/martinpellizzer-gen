    "intro": "Peperomia subrotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape, often with a slight indentation at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, appearing in clusters along the stems. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance. The foliage is prized for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
