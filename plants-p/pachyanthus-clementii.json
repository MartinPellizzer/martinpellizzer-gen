    "intro": "Pachyanthus clementii, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
