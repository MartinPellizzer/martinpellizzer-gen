    "intro": "Polyanthes pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf squill, is a small, bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value. Polyanthes pygmaea is relatively hardy and can withstand drought conditions once established."
