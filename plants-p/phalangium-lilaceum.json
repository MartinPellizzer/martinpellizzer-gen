    "intro": "Phalangium lilaceum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces both roots and fertile shoots. The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
