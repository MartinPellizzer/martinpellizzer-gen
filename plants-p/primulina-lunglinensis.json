    "intro": "Primulina lunglinensis, commonly known as the Lunglin's primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes numerous ornamental and horticulturally significant plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically tubular with brightly colored petals, often in shades of pink or white, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primulina lunglinensis is considered a conservation concern."
