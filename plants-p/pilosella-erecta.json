    "intro": "Pilosella erecta, commonly known as the erect pilosella, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Pilosella erecta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
