    "intro": "Polypodium ballivianii, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the Andes mountains. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its upright, evergreen fronds. Polypodium ballivianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
