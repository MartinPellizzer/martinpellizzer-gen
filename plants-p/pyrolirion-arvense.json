    "intro": "Pyrolirion arvense, commonly known as the field lily or meadow lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woods, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its bloom period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Pyrolirion arvense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
