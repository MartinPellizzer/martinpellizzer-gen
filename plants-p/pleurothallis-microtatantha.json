    "intro": "Pleurothallis microtatantha, commonly known as the tiny white pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
