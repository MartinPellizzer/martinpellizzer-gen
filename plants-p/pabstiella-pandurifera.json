It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the rainy season.

Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. The botanical significance of Pabstiella pandurifera lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
