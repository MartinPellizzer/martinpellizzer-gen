    "intro": "Protium gallosum, commonly known as the Philippine tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by globose, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish or brownish hue, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
