It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
