    "intro": "Pseudolarix kaempferi, commonly known as the golden larch, is a deciduous conifer native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage in autumn, which contrasts with its dark green needles during the growing season. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
