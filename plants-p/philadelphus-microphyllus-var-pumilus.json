It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a delicate, fine-textured appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in upright clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in smaller garden spaces."
