    "intro": "Prunus stellipila, commonly known as the star-shaped cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, though they are often consumed by birds rather than humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Prunus stellipila is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local wildlife and providing seasonal interest."
