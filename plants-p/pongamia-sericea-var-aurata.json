    "intro": "Pongamia sericea var. aurata, commonly known as the golden pongam, is a variant of the pongam tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are highly ornamental. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a smooth, glossy surface, and the tree can grow to significant heights in suitable conditions. The golden pongam is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it useful for reforestation and soil stabilization efforts."
