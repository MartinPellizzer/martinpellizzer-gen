    "intro": "Pouteria resinifera, commonly known as the rubber tree or Brazilian rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapotaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. The tree is notable for its ability to produce a latex sap, which has historically been used for rubber production."
