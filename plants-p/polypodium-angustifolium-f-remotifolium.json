    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium f. remotifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall fern, is a fern species characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib and serrated margins. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, which is an adaptation to its specific ecological niche. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
