    "intro": "Polypteris sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Polypteris sphacelata plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
