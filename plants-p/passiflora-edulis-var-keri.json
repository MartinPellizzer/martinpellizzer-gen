It is characterized by its striking purple to orange fruits, which are encased in a rough, spiny rind. The plant produces showy, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments that resemble a crown. Its fruit is valued for its aromatic, sweet-tart pulp, which is used in juices, desserts, and supplements. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
