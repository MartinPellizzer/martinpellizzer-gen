    "intro": "Phoradendron cauliflorum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. Its growth is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
