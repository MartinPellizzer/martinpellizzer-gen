    "intro": "Plantago longissima var. burkei, commonly known as the Burkes plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
