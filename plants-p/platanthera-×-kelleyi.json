    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 kelleyi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera psycodes. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its elongated, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. It is found primarily in the eastern United States, with populations in states like Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platanthera \u00d7 kelleyi is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
