    "intro": "Ptelea aboriginum, commonly known as the Australian ash or blackwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is often found in dry forests and woodlands, adapting well to nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its timber and has cultural significance to some Indigenous Australian communities."
