    "intro": "Psydrax gilletii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers open in the evening and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by reducing competition with diurnal pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming pattern."
