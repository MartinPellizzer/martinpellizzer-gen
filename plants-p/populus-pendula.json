    "intro": "Populus pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that drape like curtains, creating a distinctive appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Populus pendula thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
