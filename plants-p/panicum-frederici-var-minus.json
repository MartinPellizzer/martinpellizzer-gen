    "intro": "Panicum frederici var. minus, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that emerge in late summer, adding a soft, feathery appearance to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its low maintenance and ability to provide texture and interest in gardens throughout the growing season."
