    "intro": "Pinus strobus prostrata, commonly known as the creeping white pine, is a low-growing variant of the eastern white pine. It features slender, prostrate branches that form a mat-like structure, often carpeting the forest floor. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the upright form, and they retain their color year-round. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds. This variant is adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
