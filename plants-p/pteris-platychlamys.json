    "intro": "Pteris platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
