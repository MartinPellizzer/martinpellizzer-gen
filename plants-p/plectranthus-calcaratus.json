    "intro": "Plectranthus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock plant or rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
