    "intro": "Pterocarpus hayesii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
