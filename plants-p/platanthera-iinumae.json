    "intro": "Platanthera iinumae, commonly known as the Japanese marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers with a distinct greenish hue. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera iinumae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
