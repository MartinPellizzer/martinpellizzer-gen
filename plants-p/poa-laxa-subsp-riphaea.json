    "intro": "Poa laxa subsp. riphaea, commonly known as the riparian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and riparian zones. The plant has slender, tufted culms with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually pale green to reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
