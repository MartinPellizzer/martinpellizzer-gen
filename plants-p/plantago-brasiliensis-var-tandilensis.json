    "intro": "Plantago brasiliensis var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
