    "intro": "Phyllanthus serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentinite phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, particularly those derived from serpentine rock, which are rich in minerals like magnesium and iron. Its unique adaptation to such harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological studies. The plant's morphology and physiology reflect its specialized relationship with its rocky habitat."
