    "intro": "Peplis boraei, commonly known as the Arctic peplis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it survive in cold, windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Peplis boraei plays a minor role in the Arctic ecosystem, providing food for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its harsh environment."
