    "intro": "Parrya pinnatifida var. kizyl-arti, commonly known as the Kizyl-arti bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
