It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
