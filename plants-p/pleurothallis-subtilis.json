    "intro": "Pleurothallis subtilis, commonly known as the delicate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species within the orchid family."
