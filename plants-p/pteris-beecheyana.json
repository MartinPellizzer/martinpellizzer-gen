    "intro": "Pteris beecheyana, commonly known as the Beechey's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of sporangia. Pteris beecheyana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
