    "intro": "Pteris grandifolia var. socorrensis, commonly known as the Socorro water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
