    "intro": "Pediocactus parviflorus subsp. havasupaiensis, commonly known as the Havasupai prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth form, typically reaching only a few inches in height. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. This subspecies is particularly found in the Havasupai Indian Reservation in Arizona, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
