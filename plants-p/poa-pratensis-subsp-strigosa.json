    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. strigosa, commonly known as rough meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The leaves are narrow, rough, and often hairy, especially along the margins, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in turfgrass mixtures."
