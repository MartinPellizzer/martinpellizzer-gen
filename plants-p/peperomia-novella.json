    "intro": "Peperomia novella, commonly known as the New Guinea Peperomia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often variegated foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia novella is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
