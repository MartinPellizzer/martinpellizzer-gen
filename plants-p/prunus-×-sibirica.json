    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus mandshurica and Prunus pensylvanica. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, dark red or black cherry-like drupe, which is edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species."
