    "intro": "Pappophorum pappiferum, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, feathery bracts, which aid in wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Pappophorum pappiferum is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands."
