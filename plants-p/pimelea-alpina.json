    "intro": "Pimelea alpina, commonly known as the alpine banksia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, characterized by its dense, compact form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a leathery texture adapted to cold and dry conditions. Pimelea alpina is well-suited to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodland or heathland environments."
