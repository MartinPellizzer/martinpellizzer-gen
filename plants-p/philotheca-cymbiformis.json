    "intro": "Philotheca cymbiformis, commonly known as the shield-leafed philotheca, is a small shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Philotheca cymbiformis is often found in heathlands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
