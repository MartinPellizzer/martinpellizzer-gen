    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. roberti, commonly known as the small knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in various habitats."
