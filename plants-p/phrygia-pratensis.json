    "intro": "Phrygia pratensis, commonly known as the early violet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, purple-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and upright. Phrygia pratensis plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the early growing season."
