    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium subsp. masafueranum, commonly known as the Masafuera polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
