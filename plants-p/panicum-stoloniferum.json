    "intro": "Panicum stoloniferum, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to form dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant typically grows in wet to moist soils, often found in lowland areas, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of loose, open panicles. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
