    "intro": "Pitcairnia puberula, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Pitcairnia puberula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
