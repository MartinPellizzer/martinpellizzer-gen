    "intro": "Pterodes, commonly known as the \"feather fern,\" is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. These plants typically have a creeping rhizome that produces upright, bipinnate leaves. The fronds are often divided into numerous small, linear segments that give the plant its distinctive appearance. Pterodes thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
