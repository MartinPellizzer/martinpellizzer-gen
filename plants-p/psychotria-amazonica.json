    "intro": "Psychotria amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Psychotria amazonica is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has been of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies. Its ecological role in the rainforest includes contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various insects and animals."
