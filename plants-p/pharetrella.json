    "intro": "Pharetrella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pharetrella, is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Pharetrella is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and can be grown as a decorative plant in gardens."
