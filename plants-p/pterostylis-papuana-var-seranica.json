    "intro": "Pterostylis papuana var. seranica, commonly known as the Papuan sun-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Papua New Guinea. It features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy, yellow-green flower that resembles a sun. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in rainforest understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, due to their strong, musty scent. This orchid is part of the large and diverse Orchidaceae family, known for its complex floral structures and ecological adaptations."
