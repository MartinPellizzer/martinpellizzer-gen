    "intro": "Phippsia langeana subsp. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh Arctic conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
