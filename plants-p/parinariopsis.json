    "intro": "Parinariopsis, commonly known as the African wild pear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical regions of Africa, with some species extending into Southeast Asia. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is usually a fleshy, berry-like structure that can be edible, though some species are noted for their toxicity. These plants play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food for various wildlife species."
