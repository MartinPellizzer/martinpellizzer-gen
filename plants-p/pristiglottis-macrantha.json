    "intro": "Pristiglottis macrantha, commonly known as the giant spiny spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands. Pristiglottis macrantha is notable for its ability to store water, making it somewhat drought-resistant despite its preference for humid conditions."
