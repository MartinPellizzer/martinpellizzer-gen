    "intro": "Premna mekongensis var. meiophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf Premna, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The leaves are usually pubescent, with a glabrous or slightly hairy underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that turn red when mature. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
