    "intro": "Primulina dichroantha, commonly known as the two-colored primula, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, contrasting leaf colors, often featuring a deep green base with a silvery or pale underside. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
