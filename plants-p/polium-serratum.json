    "intro": "Polium serratum, commonly known as the serrated polium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in meadows and grasslands. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are often hairy to the touch. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in clusters, producing yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets. Polium serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
