    "intro": "Psammiosorus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on soil or stone. They have rhizomes that anchor them to their substrates and produce fronds that are usually leathery and dark green. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Psammiosorus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging habitats."
