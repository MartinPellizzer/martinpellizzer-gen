    "intro": "Pometia ternata, commonly known as the sweet osier or sweet osier dogwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Pometia ternata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
