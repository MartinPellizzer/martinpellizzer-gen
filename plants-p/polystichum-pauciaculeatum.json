    "intro": "Polystichum pauciaculeatum, commonly known as the sparse-furrowed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, sparse hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery covering."
