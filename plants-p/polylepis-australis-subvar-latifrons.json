    "intro": "Polylepis australis subvar. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited polylepis, is a distinctive tree species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and unique, woody fruits that are adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. This subvariety is typically found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity. The tree has a slow growth rate and is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
