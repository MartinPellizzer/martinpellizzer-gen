    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. guachipasana, commonly known as the Guachipasana cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Bolivia. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
