    "intro": "Pavonia glechomoides, commonly known as the creeping pavonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pavonia glechomoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies."
