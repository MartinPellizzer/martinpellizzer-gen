    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid cinquefoil, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
