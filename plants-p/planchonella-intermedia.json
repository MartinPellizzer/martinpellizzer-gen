It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the trunk. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elliptical, smooth, yellow or orange fruits. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine in the Pacific Islands. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
