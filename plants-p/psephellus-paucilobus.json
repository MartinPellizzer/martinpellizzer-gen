    "intro": "Psephellus paucilobus, commonly known as the few-lobed sandwort, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to six petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Psephellus paucilobus is part of the family Montiaceae and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
