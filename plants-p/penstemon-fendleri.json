    "intro": "Penstemon fendleri, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Penstemon fendleri plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and hummingbirds."
