    "intro": "Pteridium lanuginosum, commonly known as the hairy bracken, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds covered in fine, hairy scales, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Pteridium lanuginosum is a long-lived perennial that can form dense colonies, often dominating its ecological niche."
