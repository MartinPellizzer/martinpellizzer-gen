    "intro": "Pleurothallis tiarata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Pleurothallis tiarata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
