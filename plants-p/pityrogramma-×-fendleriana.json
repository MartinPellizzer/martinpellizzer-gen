    "intro": "Pityrogramma \u00d7 fendleriana, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Pityrogramma mirabilis and Pityrogramma intermedia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
