    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. glaucantha, commonly known as the glaucous meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass found in temperate regions. It is characterized by its silver-green foliage due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has slender, tufted growth habit with spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
