    "intro": "Pneumatopteris usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara spleenwort, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with sporangia arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
