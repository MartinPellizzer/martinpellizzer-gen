    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles lamottei, commonly known as the Lamotte's blackthorn, is a rare subspecies of the blackthorn plant. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, and it produces fragrant white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
