    "intro": "Physocaulis nodosus, commonly known as the nodding bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and whorled, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged. Physocaulis nodosus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
