    "intro": "Polytrema vulgare, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Polytrema vulgare is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
