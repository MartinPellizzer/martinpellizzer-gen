It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly through underground stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Polygonum proliferum is often found in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks."
