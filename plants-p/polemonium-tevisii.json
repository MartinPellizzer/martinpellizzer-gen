    "intro": "Polemonium tevisii, commonly known as the Sierra bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Polemonium tevisii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators like bees and butterflies."
