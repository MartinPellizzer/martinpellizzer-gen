    "intro": "Platanthera stenoglossa subsp. hottae, commonly known as the Hotta's narrow-lipped twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated, narrow leaves and a single, slender flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that lack showy petals, relying instead on specialized structures for pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and requires specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas."
