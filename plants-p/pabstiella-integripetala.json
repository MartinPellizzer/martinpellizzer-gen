    "intro": "Pabstiella integripetala, commonly known as the smooth-petaled pabstiella, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers with smooth, unribbed petals. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are adapted to its unique floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella integripetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
