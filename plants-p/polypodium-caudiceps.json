    "intro": "Polypodium caudiceps, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to various substrates. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
