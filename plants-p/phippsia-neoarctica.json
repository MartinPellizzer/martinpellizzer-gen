It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Phippsia neoarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
