    "intro": "Platea sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved platea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Platea sclerophylla is often found in dry forests and shrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
