    "intro": "Polypodium hartwegianum, commonly known as the Hartwig's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of its leaves. The fern's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
