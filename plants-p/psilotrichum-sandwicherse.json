    "intro": "Psilotrichum sandwicherse, commonly known as the Sandwich Islands clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
