    "intro": "Pennisetum nepalense, commonly known as Nepal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are often used in traditional floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Pennisetum nepalense is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
