    "intro": "Pothos pinnatus, commonly known as the laceleaf pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are deeply lobed and have a striking, intricate appearance. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. Pothos pinnatus is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular houseplant for beginners."
