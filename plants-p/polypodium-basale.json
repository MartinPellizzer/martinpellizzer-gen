    "intro": "Polypodium basale, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern that thrives in humid environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as a storage organ and anchor. Its leaves are typically divided into two types: fertile, which produce spores, and sterile, which are used for attachment and photosynthesis. Polypodium basale is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist areas of tropical and subtropical regions."
