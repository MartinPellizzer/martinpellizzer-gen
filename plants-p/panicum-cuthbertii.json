    "intro": "Panicum cuthbertii, commonly known as Cuthbert's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, greenish-brown flowers that mature into bristly, spikelet-like structures. This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
