    "intro": "Pedicularis pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
