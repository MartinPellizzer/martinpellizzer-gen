    "intro": "Prasophyllum castaneum, commonly known as the chestnut leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and a single, slender flower spike that bears several small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
