    "intro": "Poa versicolor, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. Poa versicolor is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas."
