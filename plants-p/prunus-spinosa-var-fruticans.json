    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. fruticans, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark blue-black berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a high level of tartness and are often used in making jams and liqueurs. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
