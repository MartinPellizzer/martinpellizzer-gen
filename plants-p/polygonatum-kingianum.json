It features slender, creeping rhizomes and is characterized by its arching stems with heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
