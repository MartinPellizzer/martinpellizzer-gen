It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial species that produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
