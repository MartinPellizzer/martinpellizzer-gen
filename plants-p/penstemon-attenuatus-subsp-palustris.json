    "intro": "Penstemon attenuatus subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, hairy stems that grow from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, often emerging from muddy or marshy soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the gentian family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to tolerate wet conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in moist environments."
