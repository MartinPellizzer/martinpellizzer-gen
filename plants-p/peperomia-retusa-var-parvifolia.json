    "intro": "Peperomia retusa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
