    "intro": "Platanthera edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a bundle of tresses. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. It has a short flowering period in late summer, and its survival is threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes. Due to its rarity, it is often protected and requires conservation efforts to ensure its continued existence."
