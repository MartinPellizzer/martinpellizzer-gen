    "intro": "Petrorhagia illyrica subsp. taygetea, commonly known as the Taygetean rockrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
