It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible date-like fruits. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
