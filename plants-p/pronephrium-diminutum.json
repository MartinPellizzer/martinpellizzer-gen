    "intro": "Pronephrium diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf kidney fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions. It features a compact rosette of finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that helps anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a soft, velvety texture. Pronephrium diminutum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements."
