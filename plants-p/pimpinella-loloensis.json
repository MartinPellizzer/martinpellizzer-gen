    "intro": "Pimpinella loloensis, commonly known as the Lolo angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small and white, forming clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
