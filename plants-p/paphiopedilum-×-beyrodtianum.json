It is characterized by its thick, velvety petals and a distinctive, intricate lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green with deep red or brown markings, adding to its ornamental value. This hybrid is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
