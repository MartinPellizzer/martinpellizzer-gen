    "intro": "Pitcairnia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvet leaf or pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and its rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
