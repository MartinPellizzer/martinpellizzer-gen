    "intro": "Plantago major f. rotundata, commonly known as roundleaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves. This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along pathways. Its leaves are broad, thick, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
