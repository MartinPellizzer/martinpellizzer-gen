    "intro": "Phegopteris rhaetica var. americana, commonly known as the American water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in freshwater environments. It has a distinctive appearance with its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically light green in color. This plant is native to North America and thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, contributing to aquatic ecosystem dynamics. The plant is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
