It features compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow, fragrant flowers clustered in racemose inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its unique pod fruits, which are elongated and contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
