    "intro": "Prunus microcarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
