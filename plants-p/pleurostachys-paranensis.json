    "intro": "Pleurostachys paranensis, commonly known as the Paran\u00e1 grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, grass-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Pleurostachys paranensis is adapted to seasonal climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
