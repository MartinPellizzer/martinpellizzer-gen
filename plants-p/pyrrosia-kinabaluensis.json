    "intro": "Pyrrosia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, specifically found in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
