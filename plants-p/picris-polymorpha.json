    "intro": "Picris polymorpha, commonly known as the variable wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Picris polymorpha is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows."
