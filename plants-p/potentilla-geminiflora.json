    "intro": "Potentilla geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flower cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, reddish fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and compact growth form."
