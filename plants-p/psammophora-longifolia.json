    "intro": "Psammophora longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Psammophora longifolia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
