    "intro": "Pleopeltis corcovadensis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
