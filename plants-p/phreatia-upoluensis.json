    "intro": "Phreatia upoluensis, commonly known as the Upolu orchid, is a species of orchid native to the island of Upolu in Samoa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant has a slender, upright stem with several leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
