    "intro": "Polygala rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in poor, sandy soils. Polygala rhombifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
