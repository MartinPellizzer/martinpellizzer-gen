    "intro": "Piptanthocereus validus, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. Piptanthocereus validus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and drought tolerance."
