    "intro": "Panicum baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Baldwin's panicgrass plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
