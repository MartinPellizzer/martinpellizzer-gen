    "intro": "Polygonum tenoreanum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots form a dense, fibrous network. Polygonum tenoreanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
