    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. umanakensis, commonly known as the Umanakensis cineraria, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
