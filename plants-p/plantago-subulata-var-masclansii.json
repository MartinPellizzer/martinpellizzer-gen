    "intro": "Plantago subulata var. masclansii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
