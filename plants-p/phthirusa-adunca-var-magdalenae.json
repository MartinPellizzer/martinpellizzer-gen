    "intro": "Phthirusa adunca var. magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalenae phthirusa, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
