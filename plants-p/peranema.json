It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. Peranema species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
