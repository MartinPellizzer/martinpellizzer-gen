    "intro": "Pancratium speciosum, commonly known as the yellow lantern or sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or near the shoreline. Pancratium speciosum is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
