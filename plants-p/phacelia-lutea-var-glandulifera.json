    "intro": "Phacelia lutea var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a compact growth habit with upright stems and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The glandular structures on its leaves may serve to deter herbivores or reduce water loss through transpiration."
