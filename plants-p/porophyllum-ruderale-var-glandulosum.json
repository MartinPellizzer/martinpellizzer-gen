    "intro": "Porophyllum ruderale var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The species is considered a weed in some regions but also has ecological value as a food source for certain insects."
