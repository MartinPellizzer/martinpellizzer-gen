    "intro": "Portlandia ophiticola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves that are adapted to grow in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
