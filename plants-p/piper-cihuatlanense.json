    "intro": "Piper cihuatlanense, commonly known as the Cihuatl\u00e1n pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca, where it grows in humid, tropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, peppery fruits. It is a climbing vine that often relies on other plants for support. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
