    "intro": "Paepalanthus harleyi, commonly known as the Harley's puya, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
