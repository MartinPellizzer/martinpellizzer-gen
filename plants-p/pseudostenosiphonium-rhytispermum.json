    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium rhytispermum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its intricate fronds and unique reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is known for its small, often epiphytic members that thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with small, scale-like leaves and specialized spore-producing structures called sporangia. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pseudostenosiphonium rhytispermum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
