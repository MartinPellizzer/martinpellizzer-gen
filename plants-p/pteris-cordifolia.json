    "intro": "Pteris cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds, which are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can produce new plantlets, contributing to its spread. Pteris cordifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
