It is characterized by its distinctive tripartite inflorescence, which consists of three narrow, wing-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a silvery or grayish hue, which helps reflect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
