    "intro": "Pteris nevillei, commonly known as the Neville's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually light green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in water gardens."
