    "intro": "Podochilus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers, which are often white or pale pink, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators."
