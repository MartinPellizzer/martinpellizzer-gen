    "intro": "Platostoma palniense, commonly known as the Palni rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and possesses fronds that are typically leathery and covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
