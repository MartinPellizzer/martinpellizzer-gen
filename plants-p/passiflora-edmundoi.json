It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a crown of filaments, a central cluster of stamens, and a unique, colorful corona. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by local communities. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora edmundoi is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
