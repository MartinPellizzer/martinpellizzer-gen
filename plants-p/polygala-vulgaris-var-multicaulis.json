    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, branched stems that often form dense clusters, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
