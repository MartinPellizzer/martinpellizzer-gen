It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical P. sogdiana, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit. It produces edible berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in local traditional cuisines. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
