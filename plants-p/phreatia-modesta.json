    "intro": "Phreatia modesta, commonly known as the modest lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble a slipper, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Phreatia modesta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
