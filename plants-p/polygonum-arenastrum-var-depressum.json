    "intro": "Polygonum arenastrum var. depressum, commonly known as the sand polygon or desert knotweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish or reddish flowers in clusters, which are often concealed by the dense foliage. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It is commonly found in desert scrub and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing loose soil."
