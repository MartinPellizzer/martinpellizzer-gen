    "intro": "Polysphaeria lanceolata subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate polypore, is a fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, bracket-like fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead hardwoods. The cap is usually pale yellow to brown, with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface. It produces spores in a white to cream-colored layer, and its structure is notable for its lack of a stem. This fungus is primarily found in temperate regions and is often associated with decaying trees in forest ecosystems."
