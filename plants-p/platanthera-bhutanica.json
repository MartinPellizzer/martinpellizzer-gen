    "intro": "Platanthera bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and northeastern India. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist habitats such as montane forests and streamside areas. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Platanthera bhutanica is classified as an epipetric or epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks or trees, and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
