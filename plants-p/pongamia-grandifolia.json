    "intro": "Pongamia grandifolia, commonly known as the Indian beech or pongam, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces long, flat pods containing seeds with a dark brown to black coat. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agroforestry systems. Pongamia grandifolia is also cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which have various industrial and medicinal uses."
