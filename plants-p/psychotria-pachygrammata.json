    "intro": "Psychotria pachygrammata, commonly known as the thick-veined psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with prominent, thick veins. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are often eaten by birds. Psychotria pachygrammata is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important component of the understory vegetation."
