    "intro": "Psittacanthus vellozianus, commonly known as the Vellozianus cycad, is a species of cycad native to Brazil. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. It produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic feature of cycads. This plant is adapted to tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
