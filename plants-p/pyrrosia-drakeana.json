    "intro": "Pyrrosia drakeana, commonly known as the Drake's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in linear rows. Pyrrosia drakeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
