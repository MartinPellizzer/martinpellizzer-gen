    "intro": "Psephellus leuzeoides, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Psephellus leuzeoides is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems."
