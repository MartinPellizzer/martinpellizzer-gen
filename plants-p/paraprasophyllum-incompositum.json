    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum incompositum, commonly known as the slender leaved paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized member of the orchid family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters and displaying a pale greenish-yellow color. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
