    "intro": "Pleopeltis palmata, commonly known as the rock fern or rock hanger, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense, clustered fronds that form a compact rosette. The leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a glossy surface that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
