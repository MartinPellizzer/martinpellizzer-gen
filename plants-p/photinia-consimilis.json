    "intro": "Photinia consimilis, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes."
