    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the eastern bracken fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Pteridium species, including its habitat preference and leaf structure."
