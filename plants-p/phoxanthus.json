    "intro": "Phoxanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf phlox, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a silvery or grayish coating, which gives the plant its common name. Phoxanthus species are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. They bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
