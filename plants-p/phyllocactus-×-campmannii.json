    "intro": "Phyllocactus \u00d7 campmannii, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Phyllocactus pachypus and Phyllocactus schweinfurthii. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in gardens and greenhouses."
