    "intro": "Poa colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Poa colombiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem."
