    "intro": "Pedicularis tuberosa, commonly known as the spotted wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers with dark spots. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
