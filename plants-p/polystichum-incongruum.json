    "intro": "Polystichum incongruum, commonly known as the incongruous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and dappled sunlight. Its spores are borne on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late spring and summer months. Polystichum incongruum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
