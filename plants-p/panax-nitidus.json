    "intro": "Panax nitidus, commonly known as the glossy ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves and a single, thick, fleshy root. The plant is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it highly valued in traditional medicine, though its conservation status remains a concern due to overharvesting."
