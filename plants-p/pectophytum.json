    "intro": "Pectophytum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants characterized by their basal leaf rosettes and often showy flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Pectophytum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
