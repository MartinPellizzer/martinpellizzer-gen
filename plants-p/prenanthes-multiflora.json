    "intro": "Prenanthes multiflora, commonly known as the common water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Prenanthes multiflora plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
