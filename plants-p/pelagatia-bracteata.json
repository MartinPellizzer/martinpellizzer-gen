    "intro": "Pelagatia bracteata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that rise above them. Its bracts are modified leaves that surround the flower heads, providing structural support and protection. Pelagatia bracteata is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions."
