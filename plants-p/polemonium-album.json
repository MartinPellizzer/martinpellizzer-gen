    "intro": "Polemonium album, commonly known as white Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems, giving it the common name \"Jacob's ladder.\" It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, often found in woodland habitats."
