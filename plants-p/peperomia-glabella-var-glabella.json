    "intro": "Peperomia glabella var. glabella, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of green or red, which are followed by spore-bearing structures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant."
