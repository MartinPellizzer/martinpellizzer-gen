    "intro": "Polystachya powellii, commonly known as Powell's spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Polystachya powellii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
