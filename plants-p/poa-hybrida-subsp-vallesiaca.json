    "intro": "Poa hybrida subsp. vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Poa hybrida subsp. vallesiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
