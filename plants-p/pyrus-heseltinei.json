    "intro": "Pyrus heseltinei, commonly known as the Heseltine pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to China. It is a small deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and sweet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly susceptible to extinction and requires conservation efforts to survive."
