    "intro": "Platanthera islandica, commonly known as the island lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the western Atlantic islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and pine barrens. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
