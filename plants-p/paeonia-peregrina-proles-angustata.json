    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina proles angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peony, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to initiate flowering. It is closely related to other peony species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
