    "intro": "Picea brevifolia, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, cone-like clusters of seeds and its distinctive, scaly bark that becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces small, oval needles that are typically two to three inches long and have a bluish-green color. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold climates with well-drained soils. Whitebark pine plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
