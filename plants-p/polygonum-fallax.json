    "intro": "Polygonum fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
