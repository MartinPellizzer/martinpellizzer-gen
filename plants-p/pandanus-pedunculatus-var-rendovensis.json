    "intro": "Pandanus pedunculatus var. rendovensis, commonly known as the Rendova pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
