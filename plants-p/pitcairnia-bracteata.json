    "intro": "Pitcairnia bracteata, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in a compact inflorescence. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Pitcairnia bracteata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
