    "intro": "Polygala subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it typically inhabits. Polygala subuniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
