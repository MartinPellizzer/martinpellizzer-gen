    "intro": "Primula montana, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features rosettes of broad, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Primula montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
