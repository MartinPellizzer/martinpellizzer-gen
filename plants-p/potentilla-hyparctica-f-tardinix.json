    "intro": "Potentilla hyparctica f. tardinix, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
