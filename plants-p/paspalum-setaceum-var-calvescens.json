    "intro": "Paspalum setaceum var. calvescens, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like blades and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
