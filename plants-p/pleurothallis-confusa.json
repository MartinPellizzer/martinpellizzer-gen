    "intro": "Pleurothallis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pleurothallis confusa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
