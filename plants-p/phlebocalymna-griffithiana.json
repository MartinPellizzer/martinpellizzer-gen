    "intro": "Phlebocalymna griffithiana, commonly known as the Himalayan rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
