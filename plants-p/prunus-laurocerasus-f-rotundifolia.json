    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the Variegated Cherry Laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage. Its leaves are elliptical to ovate, with a distinctive variegation of white and green, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used as a hedging plant or specimen in shaded areas."
