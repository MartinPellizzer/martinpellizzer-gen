    "intro": "Potentilla reptans, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Potentilla reptans thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
