    "intro": "Poa seminuda, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless or slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Poa seminuda is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
