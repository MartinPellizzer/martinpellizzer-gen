    "intro": "Prosopanche caatingicola, commonly known as the caatinga milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in the caatinga biome. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
