    "intro": "Paesia acclivis var. polystichoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and talus slopes."
