    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. melanocaulos, commonly known as the black-stemmed sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern. It is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing fronds. The dark coloration of its stems and leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of Pteris cretica."
