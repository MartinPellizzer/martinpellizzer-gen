    "intro": "Pteris stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris stricta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
