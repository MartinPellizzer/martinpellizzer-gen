    "intro": "Polypodium confluens, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, broad, and often serrated shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense, lush appearance throughout the year."
