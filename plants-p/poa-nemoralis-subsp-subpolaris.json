    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. subpolaris, commonly known as the polar bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its ability to survive in extreme cold and low light conditions makes it an important component of polar ecosystems."
