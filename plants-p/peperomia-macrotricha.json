    "intro": "Peperomia macrotricha, commonly known as the large-veined peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves with prominent, contrasting veins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically green or reddish, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and low maintenance requirements make it an excellent addition to both indoor and outdoor settings."
