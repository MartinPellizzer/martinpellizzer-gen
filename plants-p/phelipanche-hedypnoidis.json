    "intro": "Phelipanche hedypnoidis, commonly known as the Spanish snakeweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its roots are specialized for attaching to host roots. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of agricultural crops."
