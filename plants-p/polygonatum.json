    "intro": "Polygonatum, commonly known as Solomon's seal, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of about 30 species, most of which are native to Asia, Europe, and North America. The plants are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. They often have lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Polygonatum species are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture for their ornamental value and medicinal properties."
