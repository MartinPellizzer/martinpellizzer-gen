    "intro": "Pityrodia exsuccosa, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and feathery leaves, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along the coastline. Pityrodia exsuccosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
