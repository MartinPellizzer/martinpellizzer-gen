    "intro": "Polypodium sectifrons subsp. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. The subsp. angustum is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of *Polypodium sectifrons*."
