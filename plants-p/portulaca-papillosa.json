    "intro": "Portulaca papillosa, commonly known as the silky purslane, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Portulaca papillosa is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
