    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. sericea, commonly known as the silvery leaf cherry, is a unique cultivar characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This ornamental plant is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis, resulting in a blend of traits from both parent species. The foliage exhibits a distinctive velvety texture and a shimmering appearance due to the dense pubescence on the leaf surfaces. It is typically grown as a small tree or shrub, valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible cherries that are smaller than those of typical cherry trees."
