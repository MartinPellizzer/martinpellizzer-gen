    "intro": "Potentilla pseudorupestris, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Potentilla pseudorupestris is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value in rock gardens and borders."
