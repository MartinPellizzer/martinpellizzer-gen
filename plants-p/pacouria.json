    "intro": "Pacouria, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white petals that resemble translucent ghostly figures, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its unique, showy blooms that open at night. Its leaves are broad and velvety, often with a slight waxy coating to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its rarity and beauty, Pacouria is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
