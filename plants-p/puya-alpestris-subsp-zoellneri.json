    "intro": "Puya alpestris subsp. zoellneri, commonly known as the Zoellner's puya, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous violet to purple flowers. The plant is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
