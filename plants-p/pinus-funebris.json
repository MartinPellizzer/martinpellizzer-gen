    "intro": "Pinus funebris, commonly known as the black pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and long, slender needles that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, purple-coned seed cones that release winged seeds in the spring. Pinus funebris is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
