    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 serotina var. aurea, commonly known as the golden poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow to golden-green foliage, which provides ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge. It produces small, fluffy catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming more fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
