It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Panicum schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
