    "intro": "Pogonia concolor, commonly known as the pink fairy lantern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy, pinkish-purple flower that resembles a lantern. The plant has a network of rhizomes and produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing close to the ground. Pogonia concolor thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine or hardwood forests."
