    "intro": "Persica nucicarpa, commonly known as the stone peach, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by fuzzy, yellow-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. Its fruit contains a single hard pit surrounded by a juicy, sweet flesh. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other peach varieties."
