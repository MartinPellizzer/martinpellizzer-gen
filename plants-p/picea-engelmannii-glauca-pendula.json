    "intro": "Picea engelmannii glauca-pendula, commonly known as the blue spruce with weeping form, is a variant of the Engelmann spruce. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and cascading branches that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its cones are typically cylindrical and contain two seeds, while its bark is thin and reddish-brown. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique visual appeal."
