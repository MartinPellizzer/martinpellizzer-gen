    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, lip-shaped pouch that is often adorned with white margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with dark green, leathery leaves and a compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white with a contrasting lip, and it blooms during the summer months. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
