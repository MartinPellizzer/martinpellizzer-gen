    "intro": "Picea orientalis var. aurea, commonly known as the golden fir, is a variant of the oriental spruce native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its dark, needle-like leaves. The tree typically grows as a tall, conical evergreen with a dense crown, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its needles are short, stiff, and retain their color throughout the year, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. This variety is valued for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
