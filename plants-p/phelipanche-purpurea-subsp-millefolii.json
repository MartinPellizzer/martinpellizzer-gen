    "intro": "Phelipanche purpurea subsp. millefolii, commonly known as purple morning glory, is a flowering plant in the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
