    "intro": "Primula pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula pauciflora is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
