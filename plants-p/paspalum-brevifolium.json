It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in grasslands and disturbed areas. Paspalum brevifolium is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
