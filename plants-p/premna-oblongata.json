    "intro": "Premna oblongata, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The leaves are usually covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
