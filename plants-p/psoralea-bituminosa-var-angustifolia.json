It is a small shrub with woody stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The species is also known for its chemical compounds, which have been studied for potential medicinal uses."
