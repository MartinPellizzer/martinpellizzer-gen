    "intro": "Pendulorchis, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. These plants are characterized by their pendulous inflorescences, which give them their common name. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Pendulorchis species typically have showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Their growth habit involves epiphytic or lithophytic tendencies, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments."
