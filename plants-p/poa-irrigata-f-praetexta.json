    "intro": "Poa irrigata f. praetexta, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a variant of the false bentgrass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage with a distinct purple tinge along the leaf edges, which becomes more pronounced under certain environmental conditions. This grass thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
