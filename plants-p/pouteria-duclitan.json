It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, sweet, and sometimes gritty fruits. Its fruit, similar to a sapodilla, is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content. The plant is also noted for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of natural latex."
