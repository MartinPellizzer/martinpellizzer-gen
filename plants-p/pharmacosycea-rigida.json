It is characterized by its erect, fibrous stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
