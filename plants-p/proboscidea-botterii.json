    "intro": "Proboscidea botterii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive white or yellow throat. It thrives in arid environments and has adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Proboscidea botterii is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates."
