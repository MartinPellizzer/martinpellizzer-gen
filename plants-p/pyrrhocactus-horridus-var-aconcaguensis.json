    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus horridus var. aconcaguensis, commonly known as the Aconcagua pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Andean region of Chile. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring season, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
