    "intro": "Pennisetum glaucum subsp. violaceum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems that produce dense, fluffy panicles of purple or pinkish plumes, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both garden beds and container planting. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed make it a low-maintenance addition to landscapes."
