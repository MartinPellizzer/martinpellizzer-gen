    "intro": "Phylica strigulosa, commonly known as the coastal physa, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Phylica strigulosa is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in maritime climates."
