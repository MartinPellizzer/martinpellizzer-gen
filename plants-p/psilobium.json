    "intro": "Psilobium, commonly known as the sand mat or sand lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are typically found in sandy or coastal environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Psilobium species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and their ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize loose soil. The genus includes several species, such as Psilobium arenicola and Psilobium californicum, which are native to regions in North America. Due to their unique adaptations, these plants play an important ecological role in preventing erosion in arid and coastal habitats."
