    "intro": "Platanus vitifolia, commonly known as the white plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by round, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance for pollution and compacted soils. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance in both young and mature trees."
