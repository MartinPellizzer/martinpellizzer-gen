    "intro": "Platanthera dentata, commonly known as the toothed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive tooth-like projections on the petals, which give it its common name. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
