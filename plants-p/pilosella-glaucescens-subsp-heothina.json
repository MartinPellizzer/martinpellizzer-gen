    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. heothina, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
