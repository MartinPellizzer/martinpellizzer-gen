    "intro": "Polypodium polycarpon, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Polypodium polycarpon is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and is valued for its ornamental foliage and traditional medicinal uses."
