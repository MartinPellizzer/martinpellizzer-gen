    "intro": "Psychotria nzabii, commonly known as the Zabii Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the montane forests of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Rwanda and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Psychotria nzabii is also noted for its potential psychoactive properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its chemical composition and effects."
