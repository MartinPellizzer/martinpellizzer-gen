    "intro": "Prunus aspera, commonly known as the rough cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Prunus aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical significance in Chinese horticulture."
