    "intro": "Phyllodes, commonly known as the \"needle grass\" or \"garden spurge,\" are specialized leaf structures found in certain species of acacia plants. They are flattened, leaf-like appendages that serve as modified stems, often functioning as photosynthetic organs. Phyllodes are typically narrow and elongated, with a reduced vascular system compared to typical leaves. They are adapted to arid environments, helping the plant conserve water through reduced surface area. These structures are often mistaken for true leaves but play a crucial role in the plant's survival and growth."
