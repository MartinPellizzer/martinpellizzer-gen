    "intro": "Portulaca grandiflora var. immersostellulata, commonly known as the star-shaped moss rose, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from red to pink and yellow. The leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
