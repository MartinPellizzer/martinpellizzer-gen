    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
