    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum kewense, commonly known as the Kew's pseuderanthemum, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
