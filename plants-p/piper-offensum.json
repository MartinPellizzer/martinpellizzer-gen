    "intro": "Piper offensum, commonly known as the poison pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as the common black pepper plant. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and heart-shaped leaves. Its fruit, a small, yellowish berry, contains the alkaloid piperine, which is responsible for its spicy taste. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for culinary use."
