    "intro": "Pomazota bracteata, commonly known as the bracted pomazota, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to purple bracts that resemble petals, often mistaken for flowers. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has palmate leaves with a hairy surface. The bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators, playing a key role in the plant's reproductive strategy."
