    "intro": "Phlomis alba, commonly known as white cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Phlomis alba is often found in rocky soils and open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
