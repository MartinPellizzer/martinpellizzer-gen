    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. ovale, commonly known as the double-flowered poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its thick, layered petals. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces vibrant red or orange flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The double-flowered form results from a genetic mutation that causes the petals to develop in a more complex, clustered arrangement."
