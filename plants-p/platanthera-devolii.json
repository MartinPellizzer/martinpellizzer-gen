    "intro": "Platanthera devolii, commonly known as the Devol's lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It has a short-lived rhizome and produces a single, narrow leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
