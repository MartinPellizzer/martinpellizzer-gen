    "intro": "Populus dodei, commonly known as the Dodei poplar, is a rare and ancient species of poplar tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and a pale green underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support in its harsh environment. Populus dodei has adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes where few other plants survive. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
