    "intro": "Pentachaeta lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's pentachaeta, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands, and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
