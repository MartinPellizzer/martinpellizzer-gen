    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are minute and numerous, contributing to its ability to spread easily in disturbed soils. It is often found in moist, sandy or gravelly habitats such as roadsides and fields."
