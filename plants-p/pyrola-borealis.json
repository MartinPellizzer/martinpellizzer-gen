    "intro": "Pyrola borealis, commonly known as the northern wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as boreal forests and rocky slopes. Pyrola borealis is also known for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle wintergreen scent when crushed."
