    "intro": "Physoceras rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via runners. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
