    "intro": "Phyllorkis globulus, commonly known as the globular wattle, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its spherical, yellow flower heads that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Phyllorkis globulus is a valuable component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
