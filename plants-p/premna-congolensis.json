    "intro": "Premna congolensis, commonly known as African nettle or Congo nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
