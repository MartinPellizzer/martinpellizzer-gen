    "intro": "Phylax, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or red, hibiscus-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Phylax species have heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. They play an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
