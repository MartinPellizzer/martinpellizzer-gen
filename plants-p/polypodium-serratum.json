    "intro": "Polypodium serratum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features feather-like fronds with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical structure of Polypodium serratum includes a complex system of stolons and adventitious roots that aid in its propagation and survival."
