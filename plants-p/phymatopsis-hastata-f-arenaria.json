    "intro": "Phymatopsis hastata f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand phymatopsis, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in sandy soils with low moisture. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often pale green or yellow, and appear in early spring."
