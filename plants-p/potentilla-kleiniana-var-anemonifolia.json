It features upright, branched stems that bear compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and long blooming period."
