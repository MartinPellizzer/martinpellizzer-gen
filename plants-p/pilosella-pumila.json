    "intro": "Pilosella pumila, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically forming in clusters at the tips of the stems. Pilosella pumila thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Its compact growth habit and distinctive appearance make it a notable component of alpine flora."
