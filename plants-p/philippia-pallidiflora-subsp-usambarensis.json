    "intro": "Philippia pallidiflora subsp. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambarensis Philippia, is a rare subshrub native to the high-altitude grasslands of eastern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
