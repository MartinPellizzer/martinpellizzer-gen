    "intro": "Perymenium mendezii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf perymenium, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
