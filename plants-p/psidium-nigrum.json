    "intro": "Psidium nigrum, commonly known as the black sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and northern South America. It produces a distinctive fruit with a thick, inedible rind and a soft, creamy interior that is sweet and sometimes slightly tart. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep black color, indicating ripeness."
