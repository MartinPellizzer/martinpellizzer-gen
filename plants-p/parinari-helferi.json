    "intro": "Parinari helferi, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellow, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is not widely used commercially due to its limited availability."
