    "intro": "Pseudolachnostylis dekindtii, commonly known as the De Kindt's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
