    "intro": "Plectranthus efoliatus, commonly known as the silver bush or African violet, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and the subtle fragrance of its blooms."
