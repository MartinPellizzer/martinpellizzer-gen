    "intro": "Phocea, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that belongs to the family Ulvaceae. It is a multicellular, marine alga that forms dense, sheet-like colonies on rocky substrates in coastal areas. Phocea thrives in shallow, sunlit waters and is often found in tidal zones and estuaries. The plant has a simple structure with a flat, leaf-like thallus that contains chlorophyll for photosynthesis. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms."
