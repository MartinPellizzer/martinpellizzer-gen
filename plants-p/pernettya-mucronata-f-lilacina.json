    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered cowberry, is a rare and striking variant of the cowberry plant. It is characterized by its distinctive lilac-pink flowers that bloom in early summer, contrasting with the typical red or white flowers of the species. The plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub, typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils in temperate regions. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. This botanical feature makes it a unique subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
