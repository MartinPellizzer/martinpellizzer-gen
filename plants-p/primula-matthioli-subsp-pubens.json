    "intro": "Primula matthioli subsp. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other members of the Primula genus."
