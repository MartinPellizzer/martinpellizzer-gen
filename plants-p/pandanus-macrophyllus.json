    "intro": "Pandanus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, stiff, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in branched clusters, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, highlighting its cultural and practical significance."
