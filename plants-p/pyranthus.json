    "intro": "Pyranthus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are annual or biennial herbs. The plants typically have basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Pyranthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
