    "intro": "Pterocarpus mildbraedii subsp. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and distinctive, compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its hard, durable timber. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
