    "intro": "Pinguicula barbata, commonly known as the hairy butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
