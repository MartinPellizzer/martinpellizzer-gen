    "intro": "Polygonatum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous stem that produces a single, upright flower per stem, typically in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with six tepals and a short, tubular throat. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
