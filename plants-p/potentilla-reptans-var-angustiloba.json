    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to colonize rocky or gravelly areas."
