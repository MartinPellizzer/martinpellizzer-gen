    "intro": "Piper eucalyptifolium, commonly known as the lemon-scented pepper or eucalyptus pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly citrusy leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in compounds like limonene, contributing to its distinctive fragrance. Piper eucalyptifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
