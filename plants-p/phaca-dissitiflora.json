    "intro": "Phaca dissitiflora, commonly known as the scattered-flower phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phaca dissitiflora is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
