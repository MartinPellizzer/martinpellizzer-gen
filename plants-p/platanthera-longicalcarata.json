    "intro": "Platanthera longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-spurred twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist woodlands and meadows in eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs. Its flowers are characterized by long, slender sepals and petals, with a distinctive spur that extends backward. The species relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships."
