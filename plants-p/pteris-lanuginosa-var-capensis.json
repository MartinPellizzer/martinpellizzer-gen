    "intro": "Pteris lanuginosa var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a feathery structure, and the spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
