    "intro": "Paspalum minus, commonly known as little paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Paspalum minus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
