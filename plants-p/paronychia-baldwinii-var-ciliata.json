    "intro": "Paronychia baldwinii var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy paronychia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
