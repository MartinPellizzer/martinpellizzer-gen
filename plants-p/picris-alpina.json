    "intro": "Picris alpina, commonly known as Alpine sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Picris alpina is generally hardy and adapted to cold climates, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
