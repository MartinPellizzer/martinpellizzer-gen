    "intro": "Philodendron dubium, commonly known as the dark leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and deeply veined. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Philodendron dubium is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
