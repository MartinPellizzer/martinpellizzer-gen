    "intro": "Pteroneurum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances their ornamental appeal. Pteroneurum species are valued in horticulture for their unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
