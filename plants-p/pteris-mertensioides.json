It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The botanical features of Pteris mertensioides make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
