    "intro": "Pterospermadendron acerifolium, commonly known as the maple-leafed sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
