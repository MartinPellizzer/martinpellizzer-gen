    "intro": "Phormium tenax, commonly known as New Zealand flax, is a robust perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The leaves are fibrous and have a strong, fibrous texture, making them valuable for traditional weaving and craft purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky environments. The plant is also known for its ability to regenerate from its rhizomes, allowing it to form dense clumps over time."
