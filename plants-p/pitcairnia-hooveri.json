    "intro": "Pitcairnia hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, elongated leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia hooveri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features."
