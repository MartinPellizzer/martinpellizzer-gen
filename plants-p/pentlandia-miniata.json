    "intro": "Pentlandia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and produces small, round pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
