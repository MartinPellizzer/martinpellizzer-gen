    "intro": "Polypodium russelianum, commonly known as the Russian shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium russelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
