    "intro": "Primula elatior subsp. ruprechtii, commonly known as the Alpine Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in garden settings that mimic its natural habitat."
