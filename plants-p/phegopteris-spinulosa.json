    "intro": "Phegopteris spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate, and its leaves are often finely divided with a distinctive spinulose texture. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both aquatic and terrestrial phases. Phegopteris spinulosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
