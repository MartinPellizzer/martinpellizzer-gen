    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian pine, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo. It is native to the Alps and is characterized by its dense, slow-growing foliage and distinctive, often twisted trunk. The plant typically forms a compact, shrub-like form with needle-like leaves that are short and often clustered at the base of the shoots. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions. The Rhaetian pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountainous ecosystems."
