    "intro": "Pultenaea mollis, commonly known as silky pultenaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, typically in spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Pultenaea mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
