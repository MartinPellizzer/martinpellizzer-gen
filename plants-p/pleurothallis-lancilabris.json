    "intro": "Pleurothallis lancilabris, commonly known as the long-labial pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
