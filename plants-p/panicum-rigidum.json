    "intro": "Panicum rigidum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands, and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The plant's hardy nature and adaptability contribute to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
