    "intro": "Polypodium pavonianum, commonly known as the Pavonian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium pavonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
