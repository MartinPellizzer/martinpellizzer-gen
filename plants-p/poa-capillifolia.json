    "intro": "Poa capillifolia, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Australia. It features slender, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, feathery appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native garden landscapes. Poa capillifolia is also an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
