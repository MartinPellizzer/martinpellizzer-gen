    "intro": "Poa ramosa, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in coastal areas. Poa ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
