    "intro": "Psychotria aschersoniana, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's weed,\" is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its hallucinogenic properties. Due to its potent effects and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research or ceremonial purposes."
