    "intro": "Phaseolus montanus, commonly known as the mountain bean, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
