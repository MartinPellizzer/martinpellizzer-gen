    "intro": "Primula farinosa, commonly known as the meadow primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems with ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, flour-like coating, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
