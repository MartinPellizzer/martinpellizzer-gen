    "intro": "Picea chihuahuana var. martinezii, commonly known as the Chihuahua fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
