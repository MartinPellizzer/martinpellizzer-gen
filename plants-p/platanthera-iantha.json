It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a striking inflorescence of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, green, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. The species is considered rare and is often found in specific habitats with particular soil and moisture conditions."
