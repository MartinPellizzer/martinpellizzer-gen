    "intro": "Piptadenia falcata, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and as a source of timber."
