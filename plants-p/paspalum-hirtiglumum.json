    "intro": "Paspalum hirtiglumum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features dense, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
