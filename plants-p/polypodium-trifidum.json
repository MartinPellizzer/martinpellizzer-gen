It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brown, velvety spores, which aid in its reproduction. Polypodium trifidum is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world."
