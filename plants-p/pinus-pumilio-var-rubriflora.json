    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive red-brown cones, which set it apart from other pine species. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green, providing a striking contrast to the reddish cones. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters where temperatures are cool and precipitation is moderate. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
