    "intro": "Pilularia novae-hollandiae, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Pilularia novae-hollandiae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a food source."
