    "intro": "Pterygiella muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests where it clings to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterygiella muliensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
