It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread aggressively across moist soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats."
