    "intro": "Poa distans var. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-ended bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and flowering structures."
