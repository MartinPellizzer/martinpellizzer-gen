    "intro": "Psygmorchis glossomystax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with a subtle fragrance, often blooming in the summer months. Its unique appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for continued conservation efforts."
