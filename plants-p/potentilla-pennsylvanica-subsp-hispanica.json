It is a shrub that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
