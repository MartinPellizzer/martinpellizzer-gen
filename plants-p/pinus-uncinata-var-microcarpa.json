    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the Pyrenees and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is a small, slow-growing evergreen conifer with short, twisted branches and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones are small and often clustered, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, exhibiting resilience to cold and poor soil conditions. Its compact form and unique appearance make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in alpine ecosystems."
