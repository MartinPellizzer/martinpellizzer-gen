    "intro": "Physalis alkekengi var. orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange, inflated calyces that enclose the small, yellow berries. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that transition into the distinctive papery husks. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in gardens for its ornamental value. The berries are edible when ripe but are generally considered too tart for consumption."
