    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. leptocladium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
