    "intro": "Polypodium anthriscifolium, commonly known as the cow parsley fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of the plantain, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium anthriscifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both garden and natural settings."
