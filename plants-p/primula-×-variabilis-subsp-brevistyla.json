    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 variabilis subsp. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled primrose, is a hybrid species within the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant prefers cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy texture, and the subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more pronounced floral stamens. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to temperate climates."
