It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to specific regions of California, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protection and study."
