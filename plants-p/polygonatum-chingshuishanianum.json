It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
