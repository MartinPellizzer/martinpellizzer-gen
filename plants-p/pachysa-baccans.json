    "intro": "Pachysa baccans, commonly known as the red-rooted pachysandra, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, low-growing foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that provide year-round coverage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover for woodland gardens."
