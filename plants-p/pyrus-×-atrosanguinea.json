    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (common crabapple). It is characterized by its dark red to black fruit skin, which gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside. The flowers are white and borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
