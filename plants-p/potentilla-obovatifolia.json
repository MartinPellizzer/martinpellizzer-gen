    "intro": "Potentilla obovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are ovate with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
