It is characterized by its small, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
