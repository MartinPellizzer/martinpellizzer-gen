    "intro": "Peniculus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Peniculus species are typically perennial herbs that grow in moist, shaded environments. They have been historically used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity necessitates caution in use."
