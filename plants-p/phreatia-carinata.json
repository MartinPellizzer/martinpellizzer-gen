    "intro": "Phreatia carinata, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
