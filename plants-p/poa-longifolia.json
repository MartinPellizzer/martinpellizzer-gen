    "intro": "Poa longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Poa longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
