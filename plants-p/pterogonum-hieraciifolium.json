It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
