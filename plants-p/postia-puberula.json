    "intro": "Postia puberula, commonly known as the silky polypore, is a small, saprophytic fungus that grows on dead wood in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its white, velvety cap that becomes fibrous with age. The fruiting body is typically small, with a tough, leathery surface and a distinct, irregular shape. It is often found on fallen trees in forests, decomposing organic matter and contributing to nutrient cycling. The spore-bearing surface is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, making it easily distinguishable from other similar species."
