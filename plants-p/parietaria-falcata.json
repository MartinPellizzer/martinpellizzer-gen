    "intro": "Parietaria falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wall-rue, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Parietaria falcata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves contain histamine, which can cause skin irritation upon contact, making it a common allergen in some regions."
