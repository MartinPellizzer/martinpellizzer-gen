    "intro": "Penstemon angustifolius var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweetleaf penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
