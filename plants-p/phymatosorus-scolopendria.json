It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally branching rhizome and its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a unique zigzag pattern. This species is notable for its primitive morphology and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
