    "intro": "Pterostylis reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, hooded flower that resembles a small pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understoreys, thriving in areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowering period occurs during late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. The species is considered rare and is often found in fragmented habitats, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
