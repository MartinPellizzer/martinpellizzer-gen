    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 weldeniana, commonly known as the Woolly Primrose, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Primula vulgaris and Primula veris. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
