    "intro": "Phalangium sulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur spider. It is a species of harvestman, belonging to the order Opiliones, and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange coloration. The body is elongated and segmented, with a pair of long, slender legs that give it a spider-like appearance. It is typically found in moist environments such as under rocks, logs, or in leaf litter. The plant-like appearance of the sulfur spider has led to its frequent misidentification as a true spider or even a plant."
