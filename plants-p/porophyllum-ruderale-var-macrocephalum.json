    "intro": "Porophyllum ruderale var. macrocephalum, commonly known as the Mexican tarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. The species is adapted to thrive in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in xerophilous environments."
