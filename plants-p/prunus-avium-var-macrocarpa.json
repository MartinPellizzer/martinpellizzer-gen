    "intro": "Prunus avium var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its large, juicy, and often sweet fruits that are typically larger than those of the standard Prunus avium. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its fruit quality and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
