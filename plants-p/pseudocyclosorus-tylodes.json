    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus tylodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich aquatic settings."
