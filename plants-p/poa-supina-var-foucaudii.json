    "intro": "Poa supina var. foucaudii, commonly known as the bentgrass variant Foucaudii, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
