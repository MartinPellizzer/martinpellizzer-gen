    "intro": "Pseudobromus engleri, commonly known as the Engler's false brome, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
