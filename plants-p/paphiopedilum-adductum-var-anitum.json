    "intro": "Paphiopedilum adductum var. anitum, commonly known as the Anitum Paphiopedilum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals and a distinctive, modified lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, often found in shaded, humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
