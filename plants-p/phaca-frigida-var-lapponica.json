    "intro": "Phaca frigida var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland frostweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it withstand cold temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
