    "intro": "Plantago canadensis, commonly known as Canadian plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
