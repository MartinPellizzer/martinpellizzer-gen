    "intro": "Pterophylla icacifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a key species in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
