It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spongy, and often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, adapting to nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical fruits. Pericalymma spongiocaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
