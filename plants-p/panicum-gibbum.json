    "intro": "Panicum gibbum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Panicum gibbum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
