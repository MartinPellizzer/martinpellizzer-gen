It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
