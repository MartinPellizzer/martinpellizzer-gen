    "intro": "Polypleurum munnarense, commonly known as the Munnar fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the forest floor. The Munnar fern plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
