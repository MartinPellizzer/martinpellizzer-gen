This variant is characterized by its smaller, more oval leaves compared to the typical trembling aspen, and it exhibits a more upright growth habit. It is native to North America and thrives in cold climates, often found in boreal and subalpine regions. The plant has smooth, white bark and produces catkins that release seeds in the spring. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
