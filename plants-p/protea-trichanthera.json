It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white, petal-like bracts that surround small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds.
