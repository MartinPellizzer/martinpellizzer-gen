The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged on the stem, with the glumes being smooth and reduced in size. This plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
