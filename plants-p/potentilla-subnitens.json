It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays."
