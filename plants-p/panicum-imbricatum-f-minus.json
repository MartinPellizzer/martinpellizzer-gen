    "intro": "Panicum imbricatum f. minus, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its foliage is usually a muted green, with a slight bluish tint, and it tends to form dense, low-growing clumps. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
