It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its unique foliage."
