    "intro": "Pedicularis myriophylla var. typica, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red petals that resemble flames, which are adapted to attract pollinators in its cold, mountainous environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowers are tubular and bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive lower lip that extends downward. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that can mimic its natural growing conditions."
