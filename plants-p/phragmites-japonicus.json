    "intro": "Phragmites japonicus, commonly known as Japanese reed, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, feathery flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies."
