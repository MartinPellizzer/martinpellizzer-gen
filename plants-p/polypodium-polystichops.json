    "intro": "Polypodium polystichops, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and finely divided pinnae. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori."
