    "intro": "Polystichum setigerum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with fine, hairy structures called setae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and produces dense clusters of fronds. Polystichum setigerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
