It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.
