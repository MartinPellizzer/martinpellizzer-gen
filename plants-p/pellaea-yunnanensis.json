    "intro": "Pellaea yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cliff fern, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is typically found growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help protect it from desiccation. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
