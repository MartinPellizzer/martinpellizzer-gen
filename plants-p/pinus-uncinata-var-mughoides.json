    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. mughoides, commonly known as the Mughal pine, is a variant of the Spanish pine native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm long. The cones are small and woody, containing two to three seeds, and they mature within one to two years. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
