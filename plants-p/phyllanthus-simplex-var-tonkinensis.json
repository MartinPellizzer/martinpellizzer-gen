It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture and traditional medicine."
