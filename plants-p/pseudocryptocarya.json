    "intro": "Pseudocryptocarya, commonly known as the \"false cryptocarya,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are usually small and clustered, and the fruits are fleshy drupes that may be edible or toxic depending on the species. Pseudocryptocarya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
