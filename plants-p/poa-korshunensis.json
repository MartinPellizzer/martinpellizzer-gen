    "intro": "Poa korshunensis, commonly known as the Korshunov's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with blue-green glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Poa korshunensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
