    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 pseudoparvipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Polystichum parvipinnulum and Polystichum smithii. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are densely packed and often have a dark green, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
