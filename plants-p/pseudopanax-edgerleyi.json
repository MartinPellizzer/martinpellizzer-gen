    "intro": "Pseudopanax edgerleyi, commonly known as the Edgerley's celery tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
