    "intro": "Pteris amplectens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically broad and have a distinctive, shield-like shape with a pale, fuzzy underside. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to colonize rocky or shaded areas."
