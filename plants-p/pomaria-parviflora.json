    "intro": "Pomaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pomaria, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is often found in shaded areas and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Pomaria parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
