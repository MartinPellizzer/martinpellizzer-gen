    "intro": "Polypodium duale, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Polypodium duale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
