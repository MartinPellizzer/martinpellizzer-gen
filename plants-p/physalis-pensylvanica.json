It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing numerous bright orange berries. These berries are often eaten by wildlife and have a tangy, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
