    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, bottlebrush-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
