    "intro": "Pleroma andersregnellii, commonly known as the Andes bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
