    "intro": "Perymenium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf perymenium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
