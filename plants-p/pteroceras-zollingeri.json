    "intro": "Pteroceras zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's bladder fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble bladders. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with fleshy, cup-like structures that help in water retention. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy coating, which aids in survival in dry conditions. Pteroceras zollingeri is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
