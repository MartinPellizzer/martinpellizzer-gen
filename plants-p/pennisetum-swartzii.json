It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive purplish hue. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white inflorescences that resemble plumes, which are highly visible during the flowering season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Pennisetum swartzii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
