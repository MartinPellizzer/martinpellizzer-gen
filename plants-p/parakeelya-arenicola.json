    "intro": "Parakeelya arenicola, commonly known as the sand flat pebble. It is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. This species is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often growing in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
