    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. arcuatum, commonly known as the curled pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its distinctive, tightly curled pods that remain closed even when mature. The plant typically grows as an annual vine with compound leaves and small, pea-shaped flowers. Its seeds are enclosed within the tightly coiled pods, which provide protection until maturity. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
