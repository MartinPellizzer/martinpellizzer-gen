    "intro": "Praravinia mollis, commonly known as the soft prairie violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist prairies and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Praravinia mollis has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
