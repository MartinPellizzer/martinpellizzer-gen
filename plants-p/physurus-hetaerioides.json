    "intro": "Physurus hetaerioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a member of the Marsileaceae family. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a tiny four-leaf clover. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves and contain spores for propagation. Physurus hetaerioides plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
