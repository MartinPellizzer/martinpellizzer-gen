    "intro": "Pyrus karchungii, commonly known as the Karchung pear, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, mountainous climates and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky areas and alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
