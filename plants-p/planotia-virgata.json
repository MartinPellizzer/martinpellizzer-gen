    "intro": "Planotia virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's shield, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Planotia virgata is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
