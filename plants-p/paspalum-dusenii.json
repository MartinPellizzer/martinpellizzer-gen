    "intro": "Paspalum dusenii, commonly known as the Pacific coast paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, coastal environments such as marshes, tidal flats, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to saltwater conditions. Paspalum dusenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
