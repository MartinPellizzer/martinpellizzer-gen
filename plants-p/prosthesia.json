    "intro": "Prosthesia, commonly known as the \"false fig,\" is a unique plant species characterized by its modified leaves that resemble fruits. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant's botanical features include a short, woody stem and clusters of small, leaf-like structures that serve as reproductive organs. These structures, called cyathia, contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. Prosthesia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance."
