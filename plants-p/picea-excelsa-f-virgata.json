    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. virgata, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue-green foliage that is often covered with a fine layer of white wax. The cones are typically small and elongated, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This form is adapted to harsh alpine environments, exhibiting slow growth and cold tolerance. Its botanical features make it an important species in high-altitude ecosystems and for timber production."
