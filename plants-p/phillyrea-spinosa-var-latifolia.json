    "intro": "Phillyrea spinosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are broader than those of the typical Phillyrea spinosa. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers."
