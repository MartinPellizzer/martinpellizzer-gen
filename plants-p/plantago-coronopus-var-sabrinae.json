It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverbanks. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Plantago coronopus."
