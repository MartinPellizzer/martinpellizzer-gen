    "intro": "Praecereus amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in the humid environment. The fruit, which is toxic, resembles a small egg and contains alkaloids that have been studied for their medicinal properties."
