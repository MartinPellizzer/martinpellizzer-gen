    "intro": "Phegopteris andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andes fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Phegopteris andringitrensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
