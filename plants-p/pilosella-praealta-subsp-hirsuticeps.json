    "intro": "Pilosella praealta subsp. hirsuticeps, commonly known as the hairy-headed pearly everlet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that is covered in dense, white or pale yellow florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its notably hairy calyces and bracts, which give it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant is relatively rare and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes."
