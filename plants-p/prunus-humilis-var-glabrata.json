    "intro": "Prunus humilis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cherry, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that ripen in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
