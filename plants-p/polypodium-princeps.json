    "intro": "Polypodium princeps, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Polypodium princeps make it a unique and visually striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
