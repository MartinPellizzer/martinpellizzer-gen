    "intro": "Pleurothallis aquinoi, commonly known as the Aquino's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces a single, slender inflorescence with several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
