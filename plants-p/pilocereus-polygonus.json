    "intro": "Pilocereus polygonus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
