    "intro": "Piper khaoyaiense, commonly known as Khaoyai pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Thailand and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are berry-like, containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its pungent, spicy flavor, often used in traditional Thai cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
