    "intro": "Paronychia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It produces small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant blooms with tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Paronychia pumila is known for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
