    "intro": "Pilea scandens, commonly known as the creeping pilea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea scandens is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and occasional pruning to encourage bushier growth."
