It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
