It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several narrow, linear segments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round, edible fruits that resemble dates. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
