    "intro": "Paramiflos glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with multiple stems, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some animals. The sticky secretions have been studied for their potential use in natural pest control."
