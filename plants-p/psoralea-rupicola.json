    "intro": "Psoralea rupicola, commonly known as the rock psoralea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, often hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils. Psoralea rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
