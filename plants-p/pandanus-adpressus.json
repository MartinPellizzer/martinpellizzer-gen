    "intro": "Pandanus adpressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil, making it an important plant in coastal ecosystems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds, leading to the development of its distinctive, spiky fruit."
