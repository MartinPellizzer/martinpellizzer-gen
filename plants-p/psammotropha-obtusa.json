    "intro": "Psammotropha obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss. Psammotropha obtusa plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
