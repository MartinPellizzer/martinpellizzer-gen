    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin bluegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa \u00d7 sachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
