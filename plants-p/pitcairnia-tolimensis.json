    "intro": "Pitcairnia tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Pitcairnia tolimensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for tropical gardens."
