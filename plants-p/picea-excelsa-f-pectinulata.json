    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. pectinulata, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its distinctive bark that is thick, scaly, and often white or pale gray in color. The tree typically grows in cold, dry environments and is adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Its cones are small and upright, and the foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves. This subspecies is of ecological and horticultural interest due to its unique appearance and resilience to extreme climates."
