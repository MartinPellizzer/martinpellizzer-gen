    "intro": "Pogonia kungii, commonly known as the Kung's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique, fragrant, and showy floral structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, pale green to white flower with a distinctive, intricate pattern on its petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, acidic pine flatwoods and requires specific environmental conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
