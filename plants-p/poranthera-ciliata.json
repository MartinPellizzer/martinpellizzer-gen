    "intro": "Poranthera ciliata, commonly known as the fringed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive fringed appearance, which helps reduce water loss. Poranthera ciliata is often found in coastal dunes and other open habitats where it thrives in full sun."
