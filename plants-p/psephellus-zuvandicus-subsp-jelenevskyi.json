    "intro": "Psephellus zuvandicus subsp. jelenevskyi, commonly known as the Zuvandicus Jelenevskyi subspecies, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
