    "intro": "Psychotria minutifoveolata, commonly known as the small-cup psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
