    "intro": "Piqueria densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower piqueria, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its small, yellow to orange flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. Piqueria densiflora is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
