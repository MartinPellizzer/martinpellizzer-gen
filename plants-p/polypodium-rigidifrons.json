    "intro": "Polypodium rigidifrons, commonly known as the rigid frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rigid texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, fan-like structure."
