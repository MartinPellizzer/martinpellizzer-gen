    "intro": "Plantago asiatica var. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed plantain, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that are shorter than the typical variety, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces basal rosettes of broad, oval, and hairy leaves that are slightly lobed. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes at the top of the stems. This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
