    "intro": "Pseudorlaya pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pseudorlaya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
