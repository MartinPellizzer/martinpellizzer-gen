    "intro": "Pleurothallis pachyphyta, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid but sometimes dry environment. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
