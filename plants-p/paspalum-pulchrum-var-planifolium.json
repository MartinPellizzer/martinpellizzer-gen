It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and smooth, with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
