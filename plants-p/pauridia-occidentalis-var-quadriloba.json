    "intro": "Pauridia occidentalis var. quadriloba, commonly known as the western paurdia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, four-lobed leaves that give it its specific epithet \"quadriloba.\" The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
