    "intro": "Plantago exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
