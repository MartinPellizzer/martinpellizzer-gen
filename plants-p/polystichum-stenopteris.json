    "intro": "Polystichum stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features tall, upright fronds with a distinctive, narrow leaf shape and a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum stenopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
