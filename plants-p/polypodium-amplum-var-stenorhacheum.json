    "intro": "Polypodium amplum var. stenorhacheum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, bright green leaves. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
