    "intro": "Poa sclerochloides, commonly known as the hard-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and flowering lemmas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
