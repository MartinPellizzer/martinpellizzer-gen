    "intro": "Poa disticha, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive, almost frost-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, flowing foliage."
