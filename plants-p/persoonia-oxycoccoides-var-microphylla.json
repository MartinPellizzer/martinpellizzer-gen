It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
