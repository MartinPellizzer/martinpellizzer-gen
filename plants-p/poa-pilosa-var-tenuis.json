    "intro": "Poa pilosa var. tenuis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to temperate regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, soft blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. This grass is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
