    "intro": "Phalaris minor var. haematitis, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
