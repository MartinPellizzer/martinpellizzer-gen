    "intro": "Pseudobaccharis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved pseudobaccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its woody stems are typically branched and covered with rough, fissured bark. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments."
