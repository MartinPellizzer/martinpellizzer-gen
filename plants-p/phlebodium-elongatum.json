    "intro": "Phlebodium elongatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that grow from a central, creeping rhizome. The plant has a thick, leathery frond with a central groove that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Phlebodium elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
