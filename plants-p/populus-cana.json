    "intro": "Populus cana, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and it produces catkins in early spring. Populus cana is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
