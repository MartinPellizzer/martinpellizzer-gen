    "intro": "Paederota urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle. This plant is a perennial herb belonging to the Urticaceae family, characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are covered in fine, irritating hairs that release histamine when touched, causing a skin reaction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Paederota urticifolia is also known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked to remove the stinging effect."
