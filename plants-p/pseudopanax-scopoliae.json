    "intro": "Pseudopanax scopoliae, commonly known as the Scopolia punga, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in the understorey of temperate rainforests. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
