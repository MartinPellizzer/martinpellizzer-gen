    "intro": "Poa kirkii, commonly known as Kirk's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, two-rowed flowers. Poa kirkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and dense growth."
