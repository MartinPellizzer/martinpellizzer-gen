    "intro": "Phegopteris stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
