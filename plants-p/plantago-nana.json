    "intro": "Plantago nana, commonly known as the dwarf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
