    "intro": "Pycnanthemum aristatum, commonly known as upright mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a minty scent and is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces showy, tubular purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming properties."
