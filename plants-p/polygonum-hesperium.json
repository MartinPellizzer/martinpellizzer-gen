It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive nodes and often reddish stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Polygonum hesperium is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
