    "intro": "Phebalium tuberculosum, commonly known as the woolly phebalium, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, glandular hairs that give its foliage a woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat. Phebalium tuberculosum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
