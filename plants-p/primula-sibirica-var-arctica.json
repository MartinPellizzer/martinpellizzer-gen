    "intro": "Primula sibirica var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation emerges. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. This hardy species is often used in alpine gardens and as a symbol of resilience in extreme climates."
