    "intro": "Prunus verecunda f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly cherry or alpine cherry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible, tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
