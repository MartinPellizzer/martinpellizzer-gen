    "intro": "Phegopteris macrodonta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the Marsileaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are deeply divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the production of buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
