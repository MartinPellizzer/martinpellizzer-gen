    "intro": "Pterostylis faceta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hooded flower that is typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing one or two flowers, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid's flowering period usually occurs in spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
