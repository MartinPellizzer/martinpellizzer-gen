    "intro": "Parthenocissus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ivy grape, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its ability to climb using adhesive pads on its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red to black berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with hairy undersides, contributing to its common name. Parthenocissus hirsuta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to cover walls or trellises."
