    "intro": "Polemonium decurrens, commonly known as the trailing jewelweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, ascending stems that often trail along the ground, producing clusters of bell-shaped, orange-red flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its showy flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
