    "intro": "Planchonella teysmanniana, commonly known as the Taysmann's hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, spherical fruits with a sweet, fleshy pulp. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
