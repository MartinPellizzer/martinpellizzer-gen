    "intro": "Polypodium societense, commonly known as the Societ\u00e9 fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it clings to rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
