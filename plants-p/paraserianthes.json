    "intro": "Paraserianthes, commonly known as the flame tree or bracken fern tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, and they are characterized by their showy, often red or orange, bract-like flowers. The leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the trees can grow quite tall, reaching up to 20 meters in height. Paraserianthes species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking floral displays and adaptability to various soil types. Additionally, they play an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding plant life."
