    "intro": "Prosopanche bertoniensis, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
