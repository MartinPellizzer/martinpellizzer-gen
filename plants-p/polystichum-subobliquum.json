    "intro": "Polystichum subobliquum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag arrangement of fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they mature. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically leathery and dark green, with a serrated margin. Polystichum subobliquum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
