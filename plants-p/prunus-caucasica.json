It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The fruit can be used in jams and preserves, and the wood is sometimes used for small crafts."
