    "intro": "Pinus argyi var. longivaginans, commonly known as the long sheath pine, is a variant of the argyi pine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its distinctive long, sheathing bracts that enclose the cones, a feature that sets it apart from other pine species. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its needle-like leaves are arranged in clusters, and the cones are often pendulous, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The botanical features of this variant highlight its resilience and unique adaptations to its ecological niche."
