    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. domestica, commonly known as the apple tree, is a species of deciduous tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by fruits known as apples. These fruits are typically round, with a smooth skin that can range in color from red to yellow or green. The plant is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and has been selectively bred for various traits such as size, flavor, and disease resistance."
