    "intro": "Parkia pendula, commonly known as the hanging cluster bean or white shower tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Parkia pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological and agricultural benefits."
