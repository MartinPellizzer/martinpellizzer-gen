It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal. Pachira duckei is relatively easy to care for, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring moderate watering. Its name is derived from the genus Pachira, which is named after the Spanish botanist Jos\u00e9 de Pachiarotti."
