    "intro": "Polystichum pseudosetosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
