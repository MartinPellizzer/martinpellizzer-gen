    "intro": "Primulina fordii var. dolichotricha, commonly known as the long-haired primulina, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its unique foliage and showy blooms make it a sought-after species among collectors and enthusiasts of rare tropical plants. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific care requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
