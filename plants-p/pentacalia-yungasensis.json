    "intro": "Pentacalia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of the Yungas region. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale blue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
