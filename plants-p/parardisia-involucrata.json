It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Parardisia involucrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
