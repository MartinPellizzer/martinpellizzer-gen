    "intro": "Pachylobus macrophyllus var. brevipetiolulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pachylobus, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are thick and leathery, an adaptation that helps it conserve water in its native habitat. This variety is distinguished by its short petioles, which are shorter than those of the typical P. macrophyllus."
