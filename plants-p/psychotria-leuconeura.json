    "intro": "Psychotria leuconeura, commonly known as the white-veined psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with prominent white veins, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Psychotria leuconeura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its exact pharmacological properties remain under study."
