    "intro": "Pogonia pendula, commonly known as the hanging pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that hang from the stems, often in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Pogonia pendula is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
