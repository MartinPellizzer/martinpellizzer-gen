    "intro": "Polypodium nodosum, commonly known as the nodding polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, round spore cases called sporangia, which are clustered in distinctive, nodular structures along the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium nodosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
