    "intro": "Polygonatum multiflorum subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant features long, arching stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are dark red and edible, though often not consumed by humans. The subspecies is distinguished by its intermediate morphological traits between the two main species of Polygonatum."
