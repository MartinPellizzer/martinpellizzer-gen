    "intro": "Polygala caterviflora, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats and is often found in grassland or shrubland environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions."
