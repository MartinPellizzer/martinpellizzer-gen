    "intro": "Paronychia argyrocoma subsp. albimontana, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to rocky and disturbed habitats, making it a resilient species in dry, coastal regions."
