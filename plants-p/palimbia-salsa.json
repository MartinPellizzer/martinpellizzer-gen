    "intro": "Palimbia salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in saline environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Palimbia salsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate high salinity."
