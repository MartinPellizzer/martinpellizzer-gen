    "intro": "Pomaderris, commonly known as the native wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. Many species have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for their medicinal properties. Pomaderris species often grow in a variety of habitats, including heathlands and woodland areas. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
