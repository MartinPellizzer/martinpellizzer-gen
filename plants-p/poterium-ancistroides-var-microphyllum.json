It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower clusters that resemble bottlebrushes, typically ranging in color from red to orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can last several months."
