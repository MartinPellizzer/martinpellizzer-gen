    "intro": "Pultenaea tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly bush or silver wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fluffy, yellowish flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to their fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
