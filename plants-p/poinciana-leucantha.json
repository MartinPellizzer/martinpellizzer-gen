    "intro": "Poinciana leucantha, commonly known as the white poinciana, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that display bright red or orange petals with white filaments. The plant produces small, yellow, egg-shaped fruits that contain three seeds each. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Poinciana leucantha thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
