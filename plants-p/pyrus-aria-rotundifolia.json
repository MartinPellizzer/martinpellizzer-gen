This species is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The fruit is typically a small, yellowish pear with a thin skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in horticulture due to its delicate nature. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
