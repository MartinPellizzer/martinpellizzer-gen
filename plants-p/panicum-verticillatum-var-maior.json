    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. maior, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
