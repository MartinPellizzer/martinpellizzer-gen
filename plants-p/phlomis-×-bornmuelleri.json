    "intro": "Phlomis \u00d7 bornmuelleri, commonly known as the hybrid globe thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and spherical, blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, spiny seed capsules. Phlomis \u00d7 bornmuelleri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
