    "intro": "Pittosporum verticillatum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are small and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that mature to a bright red color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
