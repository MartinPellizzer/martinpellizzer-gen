It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
