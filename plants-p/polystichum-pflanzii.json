    "intro": "Polystichum pflanzii, commonly known as the Pflanz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Polystichum pflanzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
