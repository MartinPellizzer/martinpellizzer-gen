It is a fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are bipinnate and covered in small, rounded lobes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
