    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. nasuta, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive white, flaky bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
