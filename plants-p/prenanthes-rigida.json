    "intro": "Prenanthes rigida, commonly known as stiff burr cucumber, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a spiny, burr-like structure that contains seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley."
