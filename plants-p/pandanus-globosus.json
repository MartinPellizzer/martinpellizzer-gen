    "intro": "Pandanus globosus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces striking inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, consisting of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments. Pandanus globosus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
