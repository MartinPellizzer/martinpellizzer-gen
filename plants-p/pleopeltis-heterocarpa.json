    "intro": "Pleopeltis heterocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
