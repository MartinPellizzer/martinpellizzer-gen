    "intro": "Pomaria rubicunda var. hauthalii, commonly known as the Hauthalii pomaria, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is highly valued in botanical gardens for its unique coloration and ecological significance."
