    "intro": "Peperomia tutensis, commonly known as the Tutu Peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Ecuador. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are often a deep green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tutensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
