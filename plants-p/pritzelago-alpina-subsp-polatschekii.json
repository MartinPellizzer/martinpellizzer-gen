It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
