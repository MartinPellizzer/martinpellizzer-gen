    "intro": "Pedicularis diffusa subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the common lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies, due to their unique shape and nectar-producing structures. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
