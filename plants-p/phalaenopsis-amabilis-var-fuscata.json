It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The flowers typically have a white or pale pink hue with a subtle, dark veining, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in controlled environments. It requires moderate light, consistent moisture, and good air circulation to flourish."
