    "intro": "Polygonum hayachinense, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and other wetland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions outside its native range."
