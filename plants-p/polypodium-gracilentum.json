    "intro": "Polypodium gracilentum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in a rosette formation, typically on tree trunks or rocks. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium gracilentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
