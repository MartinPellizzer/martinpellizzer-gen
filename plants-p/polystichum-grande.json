    "intro": "Polystichum grande, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum grande is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a dramatic, lush appearance to gardens."
