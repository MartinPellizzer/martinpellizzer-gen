    "intro": "Potentilla simplex var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
