    "intro": "Pachycornia arbuscula, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the Sonoran Desert. It has a dense, gnarled trunk with thick, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and drought. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often shed during dry seasons to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
