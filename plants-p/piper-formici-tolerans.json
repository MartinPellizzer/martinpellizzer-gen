It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, peppery fruits. It is notable for its ability to coexist with certain ant species, which may provide protection against herbivores. This unique relationship highlights its ecological significance in its native habitat."
