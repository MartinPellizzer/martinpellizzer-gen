    "intro": "Psychotria retusa, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpets\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. Psychotria retusa contains alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been used in traditional medicine but are also toxic in high doses."
