    "intro": "Polypodium rzedowskianum, commonly known as the Rzedowski's shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
