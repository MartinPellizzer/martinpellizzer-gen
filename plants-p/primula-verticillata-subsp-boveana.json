    "intro": "Primula verticillata subsp. boveana, commonly known as the Bovean primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
