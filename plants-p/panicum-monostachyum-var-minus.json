    "intro": "Panicum monostachyum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established. Its ornamental value comes from its unique flowering structure and ability to provide texture in landscape designs."
