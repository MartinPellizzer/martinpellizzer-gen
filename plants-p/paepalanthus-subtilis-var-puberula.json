The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
