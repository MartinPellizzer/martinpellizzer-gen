    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. ernica, commonly known as the ernica butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a unique example of adaptation in nutrient-poor habitats."
