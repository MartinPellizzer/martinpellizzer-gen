    "intro": "Phaseolus atomifer, commonly known as the small-seeded bean, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, green pods that contain round, yellowish seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Phaseolus genus."
