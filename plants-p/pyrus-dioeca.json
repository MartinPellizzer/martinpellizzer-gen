    "intro": "Pyrus dioeca, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a dark blue or black color, providing food for various wildlife species."
