    "intro": "Polycantha palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to help repel water. Polycantha palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
