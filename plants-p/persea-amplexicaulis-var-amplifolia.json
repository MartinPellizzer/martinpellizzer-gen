The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, and the plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
