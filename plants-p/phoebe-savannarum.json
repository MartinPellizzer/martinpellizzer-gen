    "intro": "Phoebe savannarum, commonly known as the Florida beech, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The Florida beech is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
