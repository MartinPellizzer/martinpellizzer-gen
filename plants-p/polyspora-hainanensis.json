    "intro": "Polyspora hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan polyspora, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Polysporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
