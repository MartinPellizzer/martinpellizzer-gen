It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
