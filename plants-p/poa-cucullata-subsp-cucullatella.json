    "intro": "Poa cucullata subsp. cucullatella, commonly known as the hooded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hooded inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in early spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
