    "intro": "Podionapus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Podionapus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
