    "intro": "Poliomintha incana, commonly known as the roughleaf germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous regions. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in arid conditions, and it is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Poliomintha incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
