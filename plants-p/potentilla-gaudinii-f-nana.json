    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded form and produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that is often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in gardens with full sun exposure."
