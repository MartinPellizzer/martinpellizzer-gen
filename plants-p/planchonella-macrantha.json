    "intro": "Planchonella macrantha, commonly known as the large-fruited pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into large, fleshy fruits. The fruits are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
