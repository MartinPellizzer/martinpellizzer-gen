It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, narrow shape with serrated margins. Polypodium oranense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
