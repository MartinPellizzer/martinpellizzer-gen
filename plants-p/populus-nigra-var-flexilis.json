It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. This species is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
