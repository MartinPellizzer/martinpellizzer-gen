    "intro": "Pinguicula spathulata subsp. variegata, commonly known as the variegated butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features broad, waxy leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often variegated with yellow or white markings, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
