    "intro": "Pouteria exfoliata, commonly known as the yellow spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark, which gives it its scientific name \"exfoliata.\" The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface. Pouteria exfoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
