    "intro": "Pyrostria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrostria, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
