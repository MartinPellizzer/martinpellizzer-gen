    "intro": "Pulicaria chrysopsidoides, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
