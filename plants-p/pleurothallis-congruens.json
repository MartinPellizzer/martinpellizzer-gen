    "intro": "Pleurothallis congruens, commonly known as the \"Clove Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often resembling the shape of cloves, hence its common name. It has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted for climbing. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires specific care to thrive."
