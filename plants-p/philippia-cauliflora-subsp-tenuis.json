    "intro": "Philippia cauliflora subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender-leafed caladium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that exhibit a range of vibrant colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of the branches, a feature known as cauliflory. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces."
