    "intro": "Phyllolobium, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often palmately arranged, and their showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Phyllolobium species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
