It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Peritassa glabra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.
