    "intro": "Pseudolmedia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Pseudolmedia mollis is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
