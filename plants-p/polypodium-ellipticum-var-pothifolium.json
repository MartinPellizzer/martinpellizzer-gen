    "intro": "Polypodium ellipticum var. pothifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its distinctive leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it a notable species in botanical studies."
