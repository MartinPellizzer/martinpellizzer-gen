    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subvar. gibba, commonly known as the Scots pine with a bulge, is a variant of the Scots pine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen base on the cones, which gives it its subspecies name \"gibba.\" The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves and produces cones that are typically red-brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sunlight. This subspecies is often used in landscaping and is valued for its ornamental features and ecological importance."
