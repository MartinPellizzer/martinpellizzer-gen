    "intro": "Pimpinella pimpinellisimulacrum, commonly known as the false cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind or water. The species is notable for its similarity to true cress species, which can make identification challenging without careful examination."
