It features rhizomatous growth and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
