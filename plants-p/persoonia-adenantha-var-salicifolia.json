    "intro": "Persoonia adenantha var. salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghostpipe shrub, is a species native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is a small, woody shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or near-coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that resemble those of willow species, hence its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually during the autumn season. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and salt spray."
