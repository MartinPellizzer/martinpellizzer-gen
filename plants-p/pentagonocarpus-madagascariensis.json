    "intro": "Pentagonocarpus madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar pentagonocarpus, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped fruits, which are a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or yellow, and it produces a fragrant, five-lobed fruit that splits open when mature. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
