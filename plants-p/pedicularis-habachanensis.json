    "intro": "Pedicularis habachanensis, commonly known as the Habachan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis habachanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
