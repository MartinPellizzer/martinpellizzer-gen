    "intro": "Poa violacea, commonly known as violet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, violet-colored spikelets that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Poa violacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
