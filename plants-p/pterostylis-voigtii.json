    "intro": "Pterostylis voigtii, commonly known as the Voigt's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that resembles a small insect, a feature common in many orchid species to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem. The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
