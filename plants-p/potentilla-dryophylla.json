    "intro": "Potentilla dryophylla, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla dryophylla is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
