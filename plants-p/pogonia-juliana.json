    "intro": "Pogonia juliana, commonly known as the Julian's pink, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy pink or purple flower that blooms in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pogonia juliana is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
