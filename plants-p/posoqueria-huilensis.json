It belongs to the family Marantaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and striking, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bracteate flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
