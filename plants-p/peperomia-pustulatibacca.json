    "intro": "Peperomia pustulatibacca, commonly known as the swollen-stem peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, raised bumps or tubercles, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and as a trailing plant."
