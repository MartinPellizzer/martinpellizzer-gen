    "intro": "Pisonia silvatica, commonly known as the silky pisonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia silvatica thrives in coastal areas and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
