    "intro": "Portulaca cinerea, commonly known as the pale portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Portulaca cinerea is drought-tolerant and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
