    "intro": "Prunus avium lusus asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifolius cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the sweet cherry. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, asplenifolius leaves that resemble the fern-like foliage of the genus Asplenium. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to those of the common cherry. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists for its unique aesthetic value."
