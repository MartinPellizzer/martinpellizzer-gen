    "intro": "Porcellites cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan porcellite, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
