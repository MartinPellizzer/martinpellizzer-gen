    "intro": "Phyllodes modesta, commonly known as the small-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in yellow or pale green. Its phyllodes are covered in fine hairs and are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Phyllodes modesta is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland dry regions."
