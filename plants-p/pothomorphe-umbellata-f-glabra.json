    "intro": "Pothomorphe umbellata f. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The smoothleaf form distinguishes it from other varieties by its lack of pubescence on the leaves and stems."
