    "intro": "Pimenta racemosa subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian allspice, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown berries that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a mild, spicy aroma similar to that of allspice. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the main species, Pimenta racemosa."
