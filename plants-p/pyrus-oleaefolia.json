    "intro": "Pyrus oleaefolia, commonly known as the oliveleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, small, yellow or orange fruits. Its fruits are typically harvested in late summer and are known for their sweet, nutty flavor. Pyrus oleaefolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
