    "intro": "Polypodium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, forming dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in the wild."
