    "intro": "Pulmonaria mollis, commonly known as the soft lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in early spring. Its foliage is noted for its lobed shape and the presence of glandular dots, which contribute to its ornamental value. Pulmonaria mollis thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often used in gardens for its attractive appearance and ability to naturalize."
