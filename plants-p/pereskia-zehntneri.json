    "intro": "Pereskia zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's pereskia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Pereskia zehntneri is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive periods of drought."
