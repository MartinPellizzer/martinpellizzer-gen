    "intro": "Perityle coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuilan perityle, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to survive in low-water conditions. Its foliage is often narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Perityle coahuilensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
