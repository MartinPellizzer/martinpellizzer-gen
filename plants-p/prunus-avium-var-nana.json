    "intro": "Prunus avium var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact variety of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of around 2 to 3 meters, making it ideal for smaller gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces small, round fruits that are usually a deep red when ripe, similar to its larger counterparts but on a much smaller scale. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation, though it may be less productive than standard cherry trees."
