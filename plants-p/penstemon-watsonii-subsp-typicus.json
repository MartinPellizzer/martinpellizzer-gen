    "intro": "Penstemon watsonii subsp. typicus, commonly known as the Watson's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
