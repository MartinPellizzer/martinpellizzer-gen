It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
