    "intro": "Procris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted to thrive in the humid, tropical environments of its native habitat. Procris philippinensis is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
