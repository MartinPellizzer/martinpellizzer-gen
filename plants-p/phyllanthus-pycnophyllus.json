It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact, almost spherical shape. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in structures called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Phyllanthus pycnophyllus is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental appearance."
