    "intro": "Piptatherum holciforme subsp. longiglume, commonly known as the long-glume wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically two-ranked, with the lower glumes being longer than the upper ones, a feature that gives it its subspecific name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midvein, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This grass is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
