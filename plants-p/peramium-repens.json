    "intro": "Peramium repens, commonly known as the creeping peramium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically spreads along the ground through stolons. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique growth habit and ecological role in its native habitat."
