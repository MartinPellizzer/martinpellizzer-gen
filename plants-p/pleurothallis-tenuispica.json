    "intro": "Pleurothallis tenuispica, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The flowers are small, fragrant, and typically arranged in a spike, with petals and sepals that are often white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
