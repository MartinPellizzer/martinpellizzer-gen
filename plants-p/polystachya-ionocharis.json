It is characterized by its striking, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare orchids."
