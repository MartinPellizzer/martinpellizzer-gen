    "intro": "Polystichum yifanii, commonly known as the Yifanii wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often arching or upright. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum yifanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
