    "intro": "Phyllocarpa spinosa, commonly known as the spiny coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny branches and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
