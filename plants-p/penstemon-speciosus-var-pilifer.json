It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant features dense, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value."
