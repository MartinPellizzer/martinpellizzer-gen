    "intro": "Poa sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic grass, is a perennial species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its adaptability, Poa sudetica is considered an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
