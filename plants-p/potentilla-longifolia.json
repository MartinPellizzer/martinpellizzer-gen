    "intro": "Potentilla longifolia, commonly known as longleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
