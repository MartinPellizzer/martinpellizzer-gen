    "intro": "Pteris quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Pteris quinquelobata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
