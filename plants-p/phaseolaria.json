It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that typically open in the morning and close in the evening. The plant is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Phaseolaria produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind."
