    "intro": "Pimelea flava var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower size compared to the typical form of Pimelea flava. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
