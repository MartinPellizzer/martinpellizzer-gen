    "intro": "Pogonia unifoliata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive single, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
