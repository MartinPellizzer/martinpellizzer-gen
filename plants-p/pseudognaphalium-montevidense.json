    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat. Pseudognaphalium montevidense is often found in grasslands and open areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
