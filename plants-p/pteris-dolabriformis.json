    "intro": "Pteris dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a distinctive, almost sword-like appearance."
