    "intro": "Phyteuma trichocalycinum, commonly known as the purple beard tongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces long, slender flowering stems. Its flowers have a distinctive beard-like appearance due to the prominent stamens, which are often more prominent than the petals. Phyteuma trichocalycinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
