    "intro": "Pogospermum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Pogospermum species are native to Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and showy blooms."
