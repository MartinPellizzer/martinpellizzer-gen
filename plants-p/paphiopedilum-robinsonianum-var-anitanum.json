    "intro": "Paphiopedilum robinsonianum var. anitanum, commonly known as the Anitanum lady's slipper, is a rare and exotic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, velvety, and often dark-colored petals and sepals, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
