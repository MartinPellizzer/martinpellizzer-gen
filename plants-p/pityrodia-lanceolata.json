It features lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Pityrodia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
