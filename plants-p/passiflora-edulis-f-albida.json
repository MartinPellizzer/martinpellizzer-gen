    "intro": "Passiflora edulis f. albida, commonly known as the white passionflower, is a cultivar of the passionfruit plant characterized by its pale white flowers and edible fruit. This variety is native to South America and is cultivated for its unique, sweet, and aromatic fruit. The flowers are typically smaller and less showy compared to the standard passionflower, but they still attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit, while similar in taste to the common passionfruit, has a slightly different texture and appearance. It is often grown in tropical and subtropical regions for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
