    "intro": "Parietaria debilis subvar. ceratosantha, commonly known as the hairy pellitory, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they are borne in clusters. The plant is often found growing in association with other moisture-retaining ground cover species in its native habitat."
