    "intro": "Pilosella alpicola var. serbica, commonly known as the Serbica alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow disk flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
