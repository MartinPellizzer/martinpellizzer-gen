    "intro": "Parthenice mollis var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, woolly foliage that is typically gray-green in color, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
