    "intro": "Potentilla sibirica, commonly known as Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the colder regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Potentilla sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
