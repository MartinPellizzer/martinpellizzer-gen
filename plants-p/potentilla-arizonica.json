    "intro": "Potentilla arizonica, commonly known as Arizona cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla arizonica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
