    "intro": "Pilosella officinarum subsp. peleteriana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
