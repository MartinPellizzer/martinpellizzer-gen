    "intro": "Phyllanthus rupestris var. genuinus, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive ornamental plant in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
