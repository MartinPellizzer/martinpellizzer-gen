    "intro": "Polypodium circinatum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tightly rolled young fronds that gradually unfurl as they mature. The plant has a rhizome that is often covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps it retain moisture. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 inches in length. Polypodium circinatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on trees or rocks in forested areas."
