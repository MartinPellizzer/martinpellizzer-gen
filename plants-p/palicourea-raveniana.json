    "intro": "Palicourea raveniana, commonly known as the Raven's Island beauty, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Saint Lucia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. However, it is also known for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
