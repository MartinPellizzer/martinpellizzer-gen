    "intro": "Psoralea leucantha, commonly known as the white psoralea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Australia, particularly the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Psoralea leucantha is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
