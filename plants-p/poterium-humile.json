    "intro": "Poterium humile, commonly known as the dwarf pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy texture and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
