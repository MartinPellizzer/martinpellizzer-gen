It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a reddish hue, especially when young. Polygonum convolvuliforme is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in wet meadows."
