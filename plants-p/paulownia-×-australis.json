    "intro": "Paulownia \u00d7 australis, commonly known as the Australian emperor tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Paulownia tomentosa and Paulownia fortunei. It is characterized by its rapid growth and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces showy, violet-blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It is native to Australia and thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its fast growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a shade tree or for its timber."
