    "intro": "Parietaria judaica subsp. speluncarum, commonly known as the cave parietaria, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices. It is a herbaceous plant with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited geographical distribution. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor substrates."
