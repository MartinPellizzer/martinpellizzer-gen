    "intro": "Protea glabra, commonly known as the flat protea, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, flat, white to pinkish flower heads that consist of numerous small, petal-like bracts. The plant typically grows in fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers at the base of the inflorescence, which are less showy than the bracts. Protea glabra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also an important plant in the conservation of local biodiversity."
