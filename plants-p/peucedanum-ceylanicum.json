    "intro": "Peucedanum ceylanicum, commonly known as Ceylon angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces oval, brownish seeds that are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its medicinal value, it is also cultivated in some parts of Asia for commercial use."
