    "intro": "Poa longifolia subsp. fagetorum, commonly known as the Faget's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland margins and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
