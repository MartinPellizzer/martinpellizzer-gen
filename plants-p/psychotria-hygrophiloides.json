    "intro": "Psychotria hygrophiloides, commonly known as the water-loving Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in rainforests and wetlands where humidity is high."
