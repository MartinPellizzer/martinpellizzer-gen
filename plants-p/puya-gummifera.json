    "intro": "Puya gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-forming structure with long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
