    "intro": "Peperomia pleistostachya, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia pleistostachya is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
