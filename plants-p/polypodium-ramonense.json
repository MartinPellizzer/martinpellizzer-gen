    "intro": "Polypodium ramonense, commonly known as the Ramon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
