    "intro": "Populus grandidentata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of streamside ecosystems."
