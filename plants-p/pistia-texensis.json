    "intro": "Pistia texensis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local ecosystems."
