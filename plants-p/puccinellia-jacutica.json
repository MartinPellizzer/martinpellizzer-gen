    "intro": "Puccinellia jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian glassworts, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the cold regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded habitats."
