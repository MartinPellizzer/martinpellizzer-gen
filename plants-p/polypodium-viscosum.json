    "intro": "Polypodium viscosum, commonly known as the sticky polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in water retention. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate. Polypodium viscosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
