    "intro": "Perissocarpa steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's perissocarpa, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its unique fruit structure, known as a perissocarp, which is a one-seed fruit with a fleshy, persistent calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical forests, and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
