    "intro": "Philodendron lupinum, commonly known as the silver velvet philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green with a silvery sheen, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by red berries containing seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron lupinum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
