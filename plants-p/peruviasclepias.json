    "intro": "Peruviasclepias, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, often pink or yellow flowers. The plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow them to access water from underground sources. Peruviasclepias species typically have small, elliptical leaves and produce capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. These plants play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
