    "intro": "Polyrrhiza, commonly known as the \"water plantain,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that often form dense underwater colonies. The leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, floating or submerged depending on the species. The flowers are small and clustered, often with three sepals and three petals, and are usually white or pale in color. Polyrrhiza species are found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers in tropical and subtropical regions."
