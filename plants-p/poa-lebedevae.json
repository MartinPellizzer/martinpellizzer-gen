    "intro": "Poa lebedevae, commonly known as the Lebedev's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra-like conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Poaceae family."
