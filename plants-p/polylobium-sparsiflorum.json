    "intro": "Polylobium sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparseflower polylobium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
