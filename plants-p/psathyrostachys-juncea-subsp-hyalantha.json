    "intro": "Psathyrostachys juncea subsp. hyalantha, commonly known as the hyaline wheatgrass, is a grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dryland agriculture. Its botanical features make it valuable for ecological restoration and as a forage crop in drought-prone regions."
