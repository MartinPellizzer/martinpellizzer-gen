    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris proles macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered rock cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, deciduous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh landscapes."
