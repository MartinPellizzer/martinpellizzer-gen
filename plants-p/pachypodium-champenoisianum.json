It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem and sparse, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the dry season. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
