    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. commutatum, commonly known as the Commutatum poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinct floral morphology. It features smaller, more tightly clustered flowers compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas, with a pale yellow to orange hue. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in herbal medicine. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements and have a historical association with the production of opium. The botanical features of this variant make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and pharmacological studies."
