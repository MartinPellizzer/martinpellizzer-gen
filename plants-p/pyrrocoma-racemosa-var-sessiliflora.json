    "intro": "Pyrrocoma racemosa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered pyrrocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically sessile, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive species for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
