    "intro": "Phyllocladus aspleniifolius var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cliff-frond, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its modified leaves, known as phylloclades, which function as stems. It is native to high-altitude regions of New Zealand and thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
