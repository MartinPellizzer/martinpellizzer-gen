    "intro": "Polypodium sessile, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a distinctive appearance with a short, upright rhizome and a dense cluster of bright green, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a slightly curled tip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
