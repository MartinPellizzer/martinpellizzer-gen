    "intro": "Prestonia laeta, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing as a vine or shrub. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxicity."
