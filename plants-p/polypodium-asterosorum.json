    "intro": "Polypodium asterosorum, commonly known as the star-veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that feature a distinctive star-like pattern of veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a layer of brown, leathery tissue, which helps protect it from desiccation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
