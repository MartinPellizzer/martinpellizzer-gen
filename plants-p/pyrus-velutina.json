    "intro": "Pyrus velutina, commonly known as the downy pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and alternate, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish pomes. Pyrus velutina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in horticulture. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
