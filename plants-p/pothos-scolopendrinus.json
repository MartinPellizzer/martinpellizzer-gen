    "intro": "Pothos scolopendrinus, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a yellowish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more prized for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to climb or trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves."
