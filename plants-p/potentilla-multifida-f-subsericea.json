    "intro": "Potentilla multifida f. subsericea, commonly known as the silky potentilla, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is a shrub characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cultivated landscapes. The subspecies 'subsericea' is distinguished by its more pronounced silky texture on both the leaves and stems compared to the typical form."
