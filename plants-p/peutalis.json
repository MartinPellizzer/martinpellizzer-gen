    "intro": "Peutalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. Peutalis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
