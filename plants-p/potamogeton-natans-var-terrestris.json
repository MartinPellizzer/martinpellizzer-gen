    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland areas. This variant is distinguished from other forms of Potamogeton by its terrestrial growth habit and specific morphological features."
