    "intro": "Pelargonium propugnatum, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
