    "intro": "Peperomia orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and minimal care requirements, it is well-suited for beginners and indoor plant enthusiasts."
