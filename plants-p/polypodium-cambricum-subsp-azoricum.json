    "intro": "Polypodium cambricum subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean polypody, is a fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its limited distribution."
