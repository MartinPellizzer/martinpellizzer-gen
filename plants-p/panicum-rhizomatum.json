    "intro": "Panicum rhizomatum, commonly known as the rhizomatous grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways."
