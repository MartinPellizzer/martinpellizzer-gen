    "intro": "Phyllanthus rhizomatosus, commonly known as the African spurge, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a robust root system with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Phyllanthus rhizomatosus is known for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
