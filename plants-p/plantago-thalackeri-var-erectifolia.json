    "intro": "Plantago thalackeri var. erectifolia, commonly known as the upright plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in high-altitude environments."
