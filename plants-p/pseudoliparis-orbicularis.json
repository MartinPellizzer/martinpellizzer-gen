    "intro": "Pseudoliparis orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Actiniidae. It is characterized by its spherical or bulbous body and a crown of long, delicate tentacles surrounding its oral disc. The organism lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, attaching itself to substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of orange, yellow, or brown, which helps it blend with its environment. Pseudoliparis orbicularis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
