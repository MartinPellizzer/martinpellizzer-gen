    "intro": "Prunus nana f. gessleriana, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cherry, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, with a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a valued addition to gardens seeking a compact, flowering shrub."
