    "intro": "Pyrus pteridophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
