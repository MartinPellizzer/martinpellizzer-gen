    "intro": "Potentilla malacophylla, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla malacophylla is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
