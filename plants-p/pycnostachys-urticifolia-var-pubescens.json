    "intro": "Pycnostachys urticifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The botanical features of this variant make it well adapted to humid climates and contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
