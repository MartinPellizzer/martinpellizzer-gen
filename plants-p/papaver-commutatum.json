It produces striking, bright orange to red flowers with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corolla. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Papaver commutatum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
