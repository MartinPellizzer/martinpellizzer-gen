    "intro": "Peristylus macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled peristylus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces showy, umbel-like inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes, and the roots are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
