    "intro": "Parnassia obtusiflora subsp. typica, commonly known as the blunt-flowered parnassia, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that are often adorned with red or purple markings. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also notable for its association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
