    "intro": "Pterolepis glomerata var. sherardioides, commonly known as the coastal dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to the sandy coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a distinctive white to grayish underside that helps reflect sunlight. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
