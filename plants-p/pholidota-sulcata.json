    "intro": "Pholidota sulcata, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise, is a large terrestrial tortoise native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its robust body, high-domed shell, and distinctive spurred toes. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the presence of leaf-like scutes give it a unique botanical resemblance to certain succulent plants. While not a plant, its name may be confused with botanical terms due to its foliage-like features. This species is often mistaken for a plant due to its slow growth and appearance, but it is strictly an animal."
