    "intro": "Pouteria lenticellata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing up to 200 seeds, known as Brazil nuts. Its fruit has a distinctive, bumpy surface with shallow grooves, and the seeds are encased in a hard, oily shell. The plant is valued not only for its edible seeds but also for its ecological and economic importance in the region."
