    "intro": "Paspalum heteranthum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two types of florets, giving it the species name *heteranthum*, meaning \"different flowers.\" It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Paspalum heteranthum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
