    "intro": "Phacelia sericea var. caespitosa, commonly known as silky phacelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside due to the dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry slopes and open woodlands."
