    "intro": "Polygala somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, often clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
