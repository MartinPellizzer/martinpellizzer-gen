    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi var. multipinna, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
