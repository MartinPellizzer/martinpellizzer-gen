    "intro": "Parrya grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered parrya, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it often grows in rocky or alpine habitats. Parrya grandiflora is known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both horticulture and botanical study."
