    "intro": "Psychotria ramuensis var. pubescentia, commonly known as the pubescent psychotria, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and produce a distinctive yellowish-green hue. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, particularly in the degree of pubescence on its leaves."
