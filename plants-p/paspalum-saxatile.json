    "intro": "Paspalum saxatile, commonly known as rock paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments. Paspalum saxatile is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
