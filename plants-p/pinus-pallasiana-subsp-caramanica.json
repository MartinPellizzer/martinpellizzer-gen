    "intro": "Pinus pallasiana subsp. caramanica, commonly known as the Caramanica pine, is a subspecies native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical P. pallasiana. The cones are small and woody, containing two to three seeds, and they mature within one year. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often growing on limestone soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native range."
