    "intro": "Puya lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial plant that forms dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves, which can reach several meters in height. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence of red or orange bracts that resemble a torch, which can remain open for several months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Puya lilloi is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
