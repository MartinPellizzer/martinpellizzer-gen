    "intro": "Pulmonaria cesatiana, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often spotted with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
