    "intro": "Poa tenuifolia var. oregona, commonly known as the Oregon slender grass, is a variant of the slender grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass with fine, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in its geographic range."
