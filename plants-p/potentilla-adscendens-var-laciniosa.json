    "intro": "Potentilla adscendens var. laciniosa, commonly known as the lacecap potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with finely toothed margins that give the plant its laciniate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
