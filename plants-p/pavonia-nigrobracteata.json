    "intro": "Pavonia nigrobracteata, commonly known as the black bract paveronia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple bracts that are prominent beneath the flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
