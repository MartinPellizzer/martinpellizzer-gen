    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. laetivirens, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a vigorous trailing perennial native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it suitable for ground cover or hanging baskets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
