    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. monspeliense, commonly known as the common knotgrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
