    "intro": "Pachyloma huberioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, a common trait among plants in the milkweed family. Pachyloma huberioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
