    "intro": "Populus fremontii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The tree produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically male and female, and it relies on wind for pollination. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against drought and fire. This species plays an important ecological role in riparian habitats, offering shade and habitat for various wildlife species."
