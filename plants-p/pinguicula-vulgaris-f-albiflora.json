    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs or damp meadows. Its unique combination of carnivorous behavior and ornamental flowers makes it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
