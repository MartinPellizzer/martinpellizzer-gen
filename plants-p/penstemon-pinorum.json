    "intro": "Penstemon pinorum, commonly known as the mountain penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Penstemon pinorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
