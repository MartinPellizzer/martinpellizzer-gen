It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its floral structure is characteristic of the Epidendroideae subfamily, with showy, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
