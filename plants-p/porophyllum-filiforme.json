    "intro": "Porophyllum filiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Porophyllum filiforme is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
