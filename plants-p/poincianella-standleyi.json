    "intro": "Poincianella standleyi, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Poincianella standleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
