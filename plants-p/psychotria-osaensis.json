    "intro": "Psychotria osaensis, commonly known as the Osa Peninsula psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found near streams or in undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
