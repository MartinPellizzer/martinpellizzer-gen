    "intro": "Populus pseudotremula, commonly known as the European aspen. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its smooth, white bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Salicaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. The leaves are typically serrated and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value."
