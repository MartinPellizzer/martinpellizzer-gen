    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. pendula-major, commonly known as the weeping white spruce, is a unique variant of the white spruce species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This cultivar is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green on top and a silvery-white underneath, creating a striking visual contrast. It thrives in cooler climates and well-drained soils, often found in subalpine or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
