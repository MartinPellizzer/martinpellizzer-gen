    "intro": "Polypodium intromissum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and they are released during the dry season."
