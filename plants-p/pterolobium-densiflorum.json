It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is cultivated in some regions for both ecological and aesthetic purposes."
