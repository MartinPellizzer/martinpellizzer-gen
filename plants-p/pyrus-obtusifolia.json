    "intro": "Pyrus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that resemble small pears. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental gardening and ecological studies. Pyrus obtusifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
