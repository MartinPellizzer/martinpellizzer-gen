    "intro": "Photinia subumbellata, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its striking red to purple foliage, which becomes more intense in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a smooth margin, with a leathery texture. Photinia subumbellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
