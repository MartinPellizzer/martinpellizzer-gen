    "intro": "Parathesis perpunctata, commonly known as the punctured parathesis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate leaves with distinctive punctate markings, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
