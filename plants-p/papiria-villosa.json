    "intro": "Papiria villosa, commonly known as the woolly papiria, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, which gives it a woolly appearance. Papiria villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
