It is characterized by its long, hanging clusters of small, yellowish flowers that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant produces feathery, wind-dispersed seeds known as pappi, which aid in its propagation. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Pappobolus senex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
