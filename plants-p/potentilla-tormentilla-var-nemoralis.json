    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. nemoralis, commonly known as the common cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features compound leaves with five elliptical leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
