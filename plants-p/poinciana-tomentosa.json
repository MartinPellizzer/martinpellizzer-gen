    "intro": "Poinciana tomentosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to warm, humid climates."
