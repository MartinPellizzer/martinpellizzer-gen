    "intro": "Parthenopsis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Parthenopsis maritima is well adapted to maritime climates and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
