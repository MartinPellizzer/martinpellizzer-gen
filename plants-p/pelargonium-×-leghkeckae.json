    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 leghkeckae, commonly known as the African hybrid geranium, is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between Pelargonium hortorum and Pelargonium \u00d7 brasilianum. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, double flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and purple. The plant typically has broad, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
