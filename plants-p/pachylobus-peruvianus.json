It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Pachylobus peruvianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
