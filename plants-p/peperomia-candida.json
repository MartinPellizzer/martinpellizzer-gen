    "intro": "Peperomia candida, commonly known as the White Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically white or pale green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia candida is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
