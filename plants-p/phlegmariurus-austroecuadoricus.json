    "intro": "Phlegmariurus austroecuadoricus, commonly known as the Ecuadorian haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its small, densely packed, and often dark green to brownish-green gametophyte structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporophytes are usually short and stout, with a capsule that is often covered in a peristome. This moss plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat."
