    "intro": "Psoralea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrubland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with small, hooked appendages. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to arid environments."
