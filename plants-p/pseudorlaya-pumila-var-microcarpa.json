    "intro": "Pseudorlaya pumila var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. This variety is notable for its compact size and drought tolerance, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden environments."
