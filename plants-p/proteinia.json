    "intro": "Proteinia, commonly known as the \"blueweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. Proteinia species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Their botanical features make them popular among gardeners and botanists interested in alpine flora."
