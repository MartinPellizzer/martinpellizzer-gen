It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are green when mature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Pothos keralensis is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
