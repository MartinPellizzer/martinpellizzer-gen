    "intro": "Plantago catharinea, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette and produce small, greenish flowers in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
