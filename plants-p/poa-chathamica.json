    "intro": "Poa chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing mats. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in coastal and rocky environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and nutrient-poor soils."
