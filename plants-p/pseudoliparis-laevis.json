It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its soft, fleshy body and long, slender tentacles. The species lacks a distinct oral disc and has a smooth, unbranched structure. It is typically found attached to rocks or other substrates in tide pools and shallow reefs. Pseudoliparis laevis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as prey for various fish and invertebrates."
