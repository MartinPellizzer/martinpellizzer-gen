    "intro": "Philadelphus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, white, showy flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has a spreading, multi-stemmed habit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Philadelphus strigosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
