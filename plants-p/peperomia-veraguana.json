    "intro": "Peperomia veraguana, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to Central America. It features thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia veraguana is ideal for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light conditions and minimal watering requirements."
