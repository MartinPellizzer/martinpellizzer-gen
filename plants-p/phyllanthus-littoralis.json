    "intro": "Phyllanthus littoralis, commonly known as sea buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are rich in nutrients and antioxidants. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
