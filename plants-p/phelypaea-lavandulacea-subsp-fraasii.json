    "intro": "Phelypaea lavandulacea subsp. fraasii, commonly known as the Fraas's marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The fronds are typically unbranched and possess a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshes and along stream banks."
