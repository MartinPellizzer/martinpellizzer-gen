    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. genuina, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
