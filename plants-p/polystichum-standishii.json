    "intro": "Polystichum standishii, commonly known as the Standish's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically arched and feather-like in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish and spread in suitable habitats. Polystichum standishii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
