    "intro": "Pteris recurvata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pteris recurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
