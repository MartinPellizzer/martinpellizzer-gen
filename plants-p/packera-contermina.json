    "intro": "Packera contermina, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, blue to purple ray flowers, which bloom in late summer. Packera contermina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
