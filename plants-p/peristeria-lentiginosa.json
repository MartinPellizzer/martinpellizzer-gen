    "intro": "Peristeria lentiginosa, commonly known as the velvet tunic or star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a fleshy, underground bulb that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are dark green, strap-like, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Peristeria lentiginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
