    "intro": "Pinus scopifera, commonly known as the cliff pine or Spanish pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that grows in fascicles of five. The tree typically grows on rocky coastal slopes and cliffs, adapting to harsh, windy conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This resilient species is well-suited to arid environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
