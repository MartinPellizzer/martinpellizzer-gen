    "intro": "Portulaca frieseana, commonly known as the frostweed or the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Portulaca frieseana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sandy or rocky habitats."
