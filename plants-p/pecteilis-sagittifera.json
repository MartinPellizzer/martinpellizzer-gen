It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Pecteilis sagittifera is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
