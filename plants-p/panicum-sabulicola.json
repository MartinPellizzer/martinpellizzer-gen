It is typically found in sandy soils, often in coastal dunes or open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
