It is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia cangrejalana is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
