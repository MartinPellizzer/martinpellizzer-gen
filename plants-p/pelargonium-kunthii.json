    "intro": "Pelargonium kunthii, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and the plant produces small, red or pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Pelargonium kunthii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers."
