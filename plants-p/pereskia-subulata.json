    "intro": "Pereskia subulata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by various insects and bats. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is edible and often used in local cuisines. The plant's ability to store water in its stems makes it highly adapted to arid environments."
