    "intro": "Polystichum manickamianum, commonly known as the Manickam's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are densely packed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
