    "intro": "Pronephrium parishii, commonly known as the Paraguay orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil, and it has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi. Pronephrium parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
