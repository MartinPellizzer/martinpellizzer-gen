    "intro": "Polypodium tijuccanum, commonly known as the Tijucan fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The Tijucan fern is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
