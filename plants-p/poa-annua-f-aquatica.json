    "intro": "Poa annua f. aquatica, commonly known as water annual bluegrass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species characterized by its adaptation to wet environments. It typically grows in marshy areas, along pond edges, and in other water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged, which helps it thrive in aquatic conditions. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than those of the typical Poa annua, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to stabilize shoreline vegetation."
