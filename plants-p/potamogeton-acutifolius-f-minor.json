    "intro": "Potamogeton acutifolius f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other pondweeds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are often difficult to see. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and fish. Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams."
