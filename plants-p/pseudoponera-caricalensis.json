    "intro": "Pseudoponera caricalensis, commonly known as the African army ant, is a species of ant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Formicidae and is characterized by its small, dark-colored workers and a lack of a distinct waist. The colony is typically composed of a queen, workers, and males, with the workers being responsible for foraging and colony maintenance. This ant is known for its aggressive behavior and ability to form large, nomadic colonies. It plays an important ecological role in controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat."
