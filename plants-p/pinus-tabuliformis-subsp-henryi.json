    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis subsp. henryi, commonly known as the Henry pine, is a subspecies of the Chinese pine native to mountainous regions in northern China. It is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It is adapted to cold and dry climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The subspecies is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
