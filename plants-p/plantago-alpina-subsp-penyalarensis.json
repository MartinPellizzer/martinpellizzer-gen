    "intro": "Plantago alpina subsp. penyalarensis, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
