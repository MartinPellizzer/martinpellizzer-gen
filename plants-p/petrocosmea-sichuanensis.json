It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
