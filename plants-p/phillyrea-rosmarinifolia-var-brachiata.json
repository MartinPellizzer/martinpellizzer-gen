It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, leathery berries. It is typically found in rocky or limestone soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
