    "intro": "Potentilla dissecta, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact size and hardy nature make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Potentilla dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions."
