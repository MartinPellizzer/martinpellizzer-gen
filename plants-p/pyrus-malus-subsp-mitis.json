    "intro": "Pyrus malus subsp. mitis, commonly known as the Siberian pear, is a subspecies of the common pear native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller and more acidic than those of the common pear. It prefers cool, temperate climates and is often grown as an ornamental or for its fruit in horticultural settings. The subspecies is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
