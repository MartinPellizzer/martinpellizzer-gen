    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
