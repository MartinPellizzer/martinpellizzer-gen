    "intro": "Pterostylis diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf grassland duck orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in grasslands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, narrow leaf and a single, pale green or white flower. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, labellum-like structure and are often pollinated by small insects. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
