    "intro": "Poecilochroma funckiana, commonly known as the Funck's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to South Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
