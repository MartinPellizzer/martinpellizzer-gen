    "intro": "Pterostylis squamata var. valida, commonly known as the valid squamated helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped labellum and a single, slender stem that bears a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is relatively rare and is of conservation interest due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
