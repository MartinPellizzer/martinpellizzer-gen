    "intro": "Phegopteris triangularis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, triangular fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
