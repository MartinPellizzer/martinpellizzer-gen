    "intro": "Portulaca squarrosa, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. Its succulent nature makes it drought-tolerant and well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
