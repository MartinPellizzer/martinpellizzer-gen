    "intro": "Pennisetum petiolare, commonly known as purple moondrop, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple plumes that emerge from clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often a deep green, contrasting beautifully with the vibrant purple inflorescences. Pennisetum petiolare is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
