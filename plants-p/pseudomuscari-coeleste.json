    "intro": "Pseudomuscari coeleste, commonly known as the blue muscari, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and relatively low maintenance requirements."
