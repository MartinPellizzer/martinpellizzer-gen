    "intro": "Psidium androsianum, commonly known as the Androsian guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to common guavas. Its fruits are typically consumed fresh or used in culinary applications, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
