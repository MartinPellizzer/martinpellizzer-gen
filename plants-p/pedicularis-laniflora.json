    "intro": "Pedicularis laniflora, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
