    "intro": "Phleum paniculatum var. biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating frost and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
