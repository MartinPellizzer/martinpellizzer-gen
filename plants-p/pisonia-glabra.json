It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal or forested areas. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
