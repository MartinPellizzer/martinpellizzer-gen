    "intro": "Polyxena marginata, commonly known as the marginsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinct white or pale margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late summer, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
