    "intro": "Pterocarpus rotundifolius subsp. polyanthus, commonly known as the pink-wood or red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish hue and is used in traditional carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
