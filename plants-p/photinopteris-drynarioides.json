    "intro": "Photinopteris drynarioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a striking feature in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
