    "intro": "Polystichum bonatianum, commonly known as the Bonati's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum bonatianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
