It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent.
