    "intro": "Psychotria globiceps, commonly known as the globular psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its dense, globose inflorescence, which gives it its common name. Its small, white flowers are clustered closely together, and the plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Psychotria globiceps is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments."
