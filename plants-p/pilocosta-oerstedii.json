    "intro": "Pilocosta oerstedii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, windy conditions. Pilocosta oerstedii is well adapted to desert life, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater."
