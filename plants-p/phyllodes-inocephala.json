    "intro": "Phyllodes inocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its phyllodes are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivory and water loss. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
