    "intro": "Poa pruinosa, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Poa pruinosa is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
