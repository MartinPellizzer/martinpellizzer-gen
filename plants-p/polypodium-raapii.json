    "intro": "Polypodium raapii, commonly known as the Raapi's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium raapii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
