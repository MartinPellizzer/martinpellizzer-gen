    "intro": "Pulicaria vulgaris, commonly known as common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant features upright stems covered with fine, silky hairs and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pulicaria vulgaris is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
