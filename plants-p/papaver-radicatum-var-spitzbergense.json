    "intro": "Papaver radicatum var. spitzbergense, commonly known as Spitzberg poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle violet hue. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, arid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
