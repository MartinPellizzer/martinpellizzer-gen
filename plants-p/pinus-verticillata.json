    "intro": "Pinus verticillata, commonly known as the red pine or Canadian red pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that grow in clusters of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests across eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Due to its hardy nature, it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes."
