    "intro": "Psidium campestre, commonly known as the wild guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has simple, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fragrant fruits similar to guavas but smaller and more tart. Its fruit is often used in local cuisines and has a high nutritional value, containing vitamins and antioxidants. Psidium campestre is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental foliage and flowers."
