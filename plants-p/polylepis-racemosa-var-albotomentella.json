    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. albotomentella, commonly known as the white-haired polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for endemic wildlife in its native range."
