    "intro": "Pterostylis metcalfei, commonly known as the Metcalfe's duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to Tasmania. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its unique, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive duck-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers bloom during the late winter to early spring season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
