    "intro": "Panicum frumentaceum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes, which are often used in floral arrangements. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its seeds are small and lightweight, facilitating wind dispersal, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. This species is also valued for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
