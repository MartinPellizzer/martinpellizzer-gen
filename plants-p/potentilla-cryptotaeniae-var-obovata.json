    "intro": "Potentilla cryptotaeniae var. obovata, commonly known as the Japanese silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It features wiry, upright stems and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to obovate in shape, with a silver-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
