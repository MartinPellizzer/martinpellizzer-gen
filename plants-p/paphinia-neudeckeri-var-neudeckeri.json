    "intro": "Paphinia neudeckeri var. neudeckeri, commonly known as the Neudecker's paphiopedilum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a distinctive, recurved lip that sets it apart from other orchid varieties. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant, showy display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
