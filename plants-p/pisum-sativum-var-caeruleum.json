    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. caeruleum, commonly known as the blue bean, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its striking blue flowers, which are more intensely colored than those of the typical green pea variety. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and produces edible pods containing small, round seeds. Its blue pigmentation is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are natural pigments found in many plants. This variety is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
