It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is known for its unique ability to bloom in the evening and close during the day, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Pabstiella carrisii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its association with moonlit beauty."
