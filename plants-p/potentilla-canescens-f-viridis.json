    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. viridis, commonly known as the green-haired cinquefoil, is a holarctic perennial shrub characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with a fine, greenish pubescence that distinguishes this form from the typical variety. The plant produces five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
