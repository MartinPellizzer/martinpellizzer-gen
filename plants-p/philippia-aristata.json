It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Philippia aristata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
