    "intro": "Psammisia longicaulis, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by cylindrical seed pods. Its fibrous stalks were historically used by indigenous peoples for fiber and basket-making. Psammisia longicaulis is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
