    "intro": "Polygonum parvulum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, upright stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Polygonum parvulum is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
