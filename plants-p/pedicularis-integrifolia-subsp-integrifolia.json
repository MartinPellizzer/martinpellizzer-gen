    "intro": "Pedicularis integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem and pairs of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
