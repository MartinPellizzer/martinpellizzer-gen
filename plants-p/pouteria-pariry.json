    "intro": "Pouteria pariry, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. Pouteria pariry thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with high rainfall. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
