    "intro": "Pseudoxandra parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pseudoxandra, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
