    "intro": "Polycephalium poggei, commonly known as the Italian polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length, with a bipinnate structure that gives it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
