It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to those of the common sapotilla. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in local cuisine."
