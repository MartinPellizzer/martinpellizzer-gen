    "intro": "Paranomus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate parasol mushroom, is a species of fungus rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive cap shape and coloration. The mushroom typically grows in grassy areas and is often found associated with decaying organic matter. It has a white to pale yellow stem and a cap that ranges from brown to grayish in color. While not a plant, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
