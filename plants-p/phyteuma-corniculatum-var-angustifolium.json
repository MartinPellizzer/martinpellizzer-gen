    "intro": "Phyteuma corniculatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
