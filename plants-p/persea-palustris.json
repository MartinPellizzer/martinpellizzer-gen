    "intro": "Persea palustris, commonly known as the swamp avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and it bears small, round fruits with a thick, leathery skin. The fruit contains a single, large seed enclosed in a sweet, creamy pulp. Persea palustris thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds."
