    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. obcordipetala, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, upright stems with dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaf base, which gives it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
