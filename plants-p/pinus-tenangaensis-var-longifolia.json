    "intro": "Pinus tenangaensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a variant of the tenangaensis pine species native to certain regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its long, slender needles, typically arranged in bundles of five, which give it a distinct appearance. The tree produces cones that are often covered in a persistent, woody bract, a feature common in many pine species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and environmental stress. This variant is valued for its ecological role and timber quality, contributing to both forest ecosystems and economic activities."
