    "intro": "Polypodium marginellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
