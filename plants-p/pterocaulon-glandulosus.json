    "intro": "Pterocaulon glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Pterocaulon glandulosus is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
