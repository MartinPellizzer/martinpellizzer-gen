    "intro": "Prunus sachalinensis f. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petioled Japanese cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub or small tree native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, with a distinctive petiole structure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation."
