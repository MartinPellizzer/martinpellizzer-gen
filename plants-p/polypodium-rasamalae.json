    "intro": "Polypodium rasamalae, commonly known as the Sri Lankan wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish itself in shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
