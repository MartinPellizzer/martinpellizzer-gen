    "intro": "Piptatherum laterale subsp. verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its rhizomatous growth and its ability to form dense vegetation that stabilizes soil in wetland environments."
