    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in arctic and alpine environments."
