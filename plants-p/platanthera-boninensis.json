    "intro": "Platanthera boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin orchid, is an endemic species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a delicate, slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
