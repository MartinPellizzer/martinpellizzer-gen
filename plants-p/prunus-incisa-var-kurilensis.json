    "intro": "Prunus incisa var. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril cherry or Kuril maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and lanceolate leaves that are typically bluish-green and turn bright red in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
