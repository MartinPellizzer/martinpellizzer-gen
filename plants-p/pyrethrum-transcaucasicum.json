It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins. These compounds make it effective for pest control in organic gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
