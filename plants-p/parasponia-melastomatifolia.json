It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
