    "intro": "Pilosella cryptomastix subsp. empodista, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow, hairy, and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
