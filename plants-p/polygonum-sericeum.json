    "intro": "Polygonum sericeum, commonly known as silky knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give the plant its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white or reddish, appearing in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges."
