    "intro": "Phreatia scandens, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, trailing stems that allow it to climb and spread across tree canopies. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Phreatia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
