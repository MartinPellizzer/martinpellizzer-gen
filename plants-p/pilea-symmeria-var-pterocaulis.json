It belongs to the Araceae family and is native to China, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it relatively drought-tolerant. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
