    "intro": "Pachylophus, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a genus of lichens characterized by their complex thallus structure and diverse morphological forms. These lichens typically consist of a fungal component (ascomycete) and a photosynthetic partner (cyanobacterium or green alga), forming a symbiotic relationship. They are often found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions. Pachylophus species are known for their ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions due to their slow growth and efficient water retention. The genus exhibits a wide range of growth forms, including crustose, foliose, and fruticose, which contribute to their ecological versatility."
