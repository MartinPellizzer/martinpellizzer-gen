    "intro": "Pentadesma reyndersii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous wood and small, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or savannas. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
