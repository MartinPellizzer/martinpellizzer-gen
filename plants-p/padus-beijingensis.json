    "intro": "Padus beijingensis, commonly known as Beijing elm, is a deciduous tree native to northern China. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in urban landscapes."
