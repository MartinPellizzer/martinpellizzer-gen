    "intro": "Psiadiella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Psiadiella humilis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings."
