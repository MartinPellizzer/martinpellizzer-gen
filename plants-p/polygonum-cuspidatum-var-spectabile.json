    "intro": "Polygonum cuspidatum var. spectabile, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 2-3 meters tall, covered with reddish-brown nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, berry-like seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides."
