    "intro": "Parablechnum vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus that ranges in color from yellowish-green to dark green. The lichen lacks distinct lobes but has a smooth, uniform surface. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
