    "intro": "Peucedanum venosum, commonly known as cow parsley or wild carrot, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hollow, ridged stems and finely divided foliage. Its flowers are white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
