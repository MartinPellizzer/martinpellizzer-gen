    "intro": "Pedicularis przewalskii subsp. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
