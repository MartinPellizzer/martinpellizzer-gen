It features dense, upright growth with dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in terminal clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to cold, dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
