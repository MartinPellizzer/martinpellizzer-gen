    "intro": "Pavonia setifer, commonly known as the hairy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Pavonia setifer is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
