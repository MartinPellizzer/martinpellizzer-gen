It features bright blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green, which contrasts beautifully with the colorful blooms. It is well-suited for rock gardens, woodland edges, and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
