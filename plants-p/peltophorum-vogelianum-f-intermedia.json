    "intro": "Peltophorum vogelianum f. intermedia, commonly known as the Indian peacock tree or the velvetwood, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking, feathery foliage that turns a deep red during the dry season. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
