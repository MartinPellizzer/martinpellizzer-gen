    "intro": "Pinalia clavata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Pinalia clavata typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
