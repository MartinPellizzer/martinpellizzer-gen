It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
