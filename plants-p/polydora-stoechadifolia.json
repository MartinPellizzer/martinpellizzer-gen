    "intro": "Polydora stoechadifolia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastlines. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for coastal habitats and it is often used in rock gardens."
