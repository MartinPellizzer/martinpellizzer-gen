    "intro": "Pelargonium fulminans, commonly known as the storm plant, is a unique species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in response to electrical stimuli, such as lightning or static electricity. The plant's ability to detect and react to electrical charges makes it a fascinating subject in botanical research. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and greenhouses."
