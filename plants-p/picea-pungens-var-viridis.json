    "intro": "Picea pungens var. viridis, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a cultivar of the blue spruce species. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to a dense layer of waxy cuticle on the needles. The plant is an evergreen conifer with a conical shape and is native to the mountainous regions of Colorado. Its needles are short, stiff, and arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various climates."
