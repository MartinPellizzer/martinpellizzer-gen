    "intro": "Pulmonaria affinis, commonly known as the lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, hairy leaves that are often spotted with purple or red markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats. Its common name derives from the leaf patterns resembling lung tissue, though it has no medicinal use for respiratory ailments."
