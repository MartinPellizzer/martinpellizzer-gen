    "intro": "Pulegium vulgare f. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy purple mint, is a variant of the purple mint plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and medicinal plants. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic and expectorant properties. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other forms of Pulegium vulgare."
