It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a slightly curled or rolled appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
