    "intro": "Polystichum riedleanum, commonly known as the Riedel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Polystichum riedleanum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
