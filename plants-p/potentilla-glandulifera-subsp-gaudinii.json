It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are palmately divided into five to seven lobes, often covered with fine, glandular hairs.
