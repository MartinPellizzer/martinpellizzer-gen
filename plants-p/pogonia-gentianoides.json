    "intro": "Pogonia gentianoides, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to trap pollinators like bees. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
