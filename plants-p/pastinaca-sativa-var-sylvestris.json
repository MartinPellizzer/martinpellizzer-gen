    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa var. sylvestris, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, known as umbels, during its second year of growth. Its roots are typically white and fibrous, though they are not commonly harvested for culinary use. Wild parsnip contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if the sap comes into contact with skin and is then exposed to sunlight."
