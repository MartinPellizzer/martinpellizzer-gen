    "intro": "Pleopeltis ottoniana, commonly known as the Otto's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis ottoniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
