    "intro": "Pyrola secunda var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern United States and Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in boreal and temperate ecosystems."
