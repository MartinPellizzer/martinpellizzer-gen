It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in Scotland."
