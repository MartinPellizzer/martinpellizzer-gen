    "intro": "Phyllanthus olivaceus, commonly known as the oliveleaf or greenleaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often green to yellow in color. Its leaves are characterized by their smooth surface and lack of stipules, which is a distinguishing feature in the Phyllanthaceae family. Phyllanthus olivaceus is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
