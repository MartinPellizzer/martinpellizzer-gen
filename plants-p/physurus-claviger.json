    "intro": "Physurus claviger, commonly known as the spiny puffer or spiny sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in small, spiny projections. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of mollusk, and its body is typically adorned with a variety of colored patterns. It feeds primarily on algae and other marine plants, playing a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for marine biology studies."
