    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant typically forms low, compact clumps and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine-textured foliage."
