    "intro": "Phyllanthus cardiophyllus, commonly known as the heart-leaved phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often glossy and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
