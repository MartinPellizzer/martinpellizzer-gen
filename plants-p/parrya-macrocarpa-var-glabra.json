    "intro": "Parrya macrocarpa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed parrya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, smooth, and often glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in hue, which bloom in late spring. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
