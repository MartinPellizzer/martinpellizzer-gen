It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a striking silver underside. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is evergreen, providing a lush, tropical appearance indoors. Philodendron alatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
