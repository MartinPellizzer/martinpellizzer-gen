    "intro": "Polypodium friedrichsthalianum, commonly known as the Friedrichsthal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
