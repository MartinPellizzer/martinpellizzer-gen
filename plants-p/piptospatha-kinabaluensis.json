    "intro": "Piptospatha kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu starling tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, yellowish flowers. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the high-altitude environment, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
