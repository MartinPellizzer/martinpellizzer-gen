It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are a good source of protein and can be prepared as a flour. Additionally, it plays a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil."
