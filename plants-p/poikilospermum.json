    "intro": "Poikilospermum, commonly known as the \"flowering nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers and berries, which can be toxic to humans and animals. They are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Poikilospermum species have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
