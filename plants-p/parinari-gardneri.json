    "intro": "Parinari gardneri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, and the tree is valued for its durable wood used in furniture and construction. Parinari gardneri is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
