    "intro": "Phymatopteris digitata, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
