    "intro": "Populus xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng poplar, is a rare species of poplar native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
