    "intro": "Pilocereus monacanthus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce night-blooming flowers. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful, fleshy upper portion called the \"body\" and a green, stem-like base known as the \"foot.\" It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking, often fragrant flowers that open at night."
