It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
