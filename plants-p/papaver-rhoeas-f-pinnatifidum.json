    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the split-leaved poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. This form exhibits a more pronounced foliage structure compared to the typical species, with leaves that are pinnatifid, meaning they are divided into narrow segments. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers with a white center, similar to the standard Papaver rhoeas. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in gardens or naturalized areas. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to flora collections."
