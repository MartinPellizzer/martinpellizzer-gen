    "intro": "Parietaria mauritanica var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf wall-rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found growing along walls, roadsides, and in rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, dry environments."
