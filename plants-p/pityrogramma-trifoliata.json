    "intro": "Pityrogramma trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate (three-lobed) leaves, which are typically delicate and pinnately divided. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds that emerge from the soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
