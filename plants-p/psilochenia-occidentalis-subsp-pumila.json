    "intro": "Psilochenia occidentalis subsp. pumila, commonly known as the western dwarf psilochenia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of greenish-white, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
