    "intro": "Pyrus malus pleniflora, commonly known as the full-flowered apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree known for its abundant flowering. It produces clusters of small, white blossoms that cover the tree in early spring, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its fruit, while edible, is typically smaller and less flavorful compared to standard apple varieties. This cultivar is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production."
