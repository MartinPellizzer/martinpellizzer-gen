    "intro": "Peucedanum dispersum, commonly known as the scattered angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of parsley, and have a mild, aromatic scent. Peucedanum dispersum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
