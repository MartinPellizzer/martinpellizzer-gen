    "intro": "Prunus diapraea, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small cherry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans due to their tart flavor. Prunus diapraea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for gardens and botanical collections."
