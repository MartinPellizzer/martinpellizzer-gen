    "intro": "Polypodium megacuspe, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's robust rhizome allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
