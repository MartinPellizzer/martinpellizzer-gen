    "intro": "Phaeanthus heteropetalus, commonly known as the showy phaeanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
