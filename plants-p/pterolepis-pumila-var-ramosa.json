It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
