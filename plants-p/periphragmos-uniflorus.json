    "intro": "Periphragmos uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower wallwort, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per inflorescence, which appears in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
