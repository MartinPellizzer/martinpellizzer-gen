    "intro": "Porochna hoffmanni-ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's porochna, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of many members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
