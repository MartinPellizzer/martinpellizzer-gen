    "intro": "Plinia icardiana, commonly known as the Icard's waxapple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, with a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
