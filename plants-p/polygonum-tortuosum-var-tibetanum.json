    "intro": "Polygonum tortuosum var. tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
