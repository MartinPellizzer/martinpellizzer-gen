    "intro": "Praravinia glabra, commonly known as smooth prairie violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and produces small, violet-colored flowers in early spring. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Praravinia glabra is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland habitats."
