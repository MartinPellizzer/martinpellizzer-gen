    "intro": "Polypodium ciliatum, commonly known as the crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
