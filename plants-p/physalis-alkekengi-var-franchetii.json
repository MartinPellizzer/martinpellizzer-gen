    "intro": "Physalis alkekengi var. franchetii, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or winter cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its distinctive orange-red, paper-thin husks that encase the fruit, which is typically a small, yellowish berry. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, lantern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, typically blooming in late summer and producing fruit in the fall. The fruit is edible when fully ripe but is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications."
