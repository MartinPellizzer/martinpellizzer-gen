    "intro": "Pimpinella stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is native to western North America, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a small, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
