    "intro": "Perezia fonckii, commonly known as the Fonck's perezia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia fonckii is considered a vulnerable species."
