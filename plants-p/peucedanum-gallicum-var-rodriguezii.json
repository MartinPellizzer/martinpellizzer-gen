    "intro": "Peucedanum gallicum var. rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodriguez's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of its more common relatives. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
