    "intro": "Poa tolmatchewii var. stricta, commonly known as the strict meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
