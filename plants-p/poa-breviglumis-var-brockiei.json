    "intro": "Poa breviglumis var. brockiei, commonly known as the Brockei meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland and riparian habitats."
