    "intro": "Podosemum arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and sprawling. Podosemum arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
