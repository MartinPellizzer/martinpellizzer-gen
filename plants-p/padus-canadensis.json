    "intro": "Padus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian white ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The wood is strong and durable, historically used for tool handles and sports equipment."
