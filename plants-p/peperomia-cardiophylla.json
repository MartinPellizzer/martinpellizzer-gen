    "intro": "Peperomia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features oval to heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia cardiophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
