    "intro": "Psilactis heterocarpa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
