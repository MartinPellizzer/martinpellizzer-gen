    "intro": "Parosela polycephala var. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
