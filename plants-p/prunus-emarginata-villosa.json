    "intro": "Prunus emarginata villosa, commonly known as the hairy cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes that are usually red or yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blossoms, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
