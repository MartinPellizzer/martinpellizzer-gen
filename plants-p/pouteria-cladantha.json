    "intro": "Pouteria cladantha, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces edible, oily seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. Its fruiting bodies can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making them one of the largest in the Sapotaceae family. Pouteria cladantha plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest."
