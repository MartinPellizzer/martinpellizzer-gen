    "intro": "Panicum mollicomum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple hues. Silky panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland restoration projects."
