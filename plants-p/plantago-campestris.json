    "intro": "Plantago campestris, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces erect flowering stems with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette structure, fibrous root system, and its ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types."
