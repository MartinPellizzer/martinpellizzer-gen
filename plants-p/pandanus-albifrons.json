    "intro": "Pandanus albifrons, commonly known as the white-fringed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often adorned with white margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its foliage is frequently used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its roots are sometimes used in herbal remedies. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
