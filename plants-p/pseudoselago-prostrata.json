    "intro": "Pseudoselago prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pseudoselago, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland conditions."
