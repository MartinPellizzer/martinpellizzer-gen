It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces fruit that resembles a legume pod, containing edible seeds that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nutritional properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
