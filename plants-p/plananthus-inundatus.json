    "intro": "Plananthus inundatus, commonly known as the floodplain flax, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its fibrous, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas prone to seasonal flooding. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
