    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in pairs. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and pests. Pinus sylvestris is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and adaptability to various soil types."
