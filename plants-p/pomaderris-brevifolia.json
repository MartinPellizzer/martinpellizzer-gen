    "intro": "Pomaderris brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pomaderris, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It is typically found in dry sclerophyll forests and is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Pomaderris brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden landscaping."
