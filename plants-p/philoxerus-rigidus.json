    "intro": "Philoxerus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid stem cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered with spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Philoxerus rigidus is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
