    "intro": "Prunus sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin cherry or Japanese white cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are generally less sweet and more tart. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus sachalinensis is often cultivated as an ornamental tree for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its ecological benefits."
