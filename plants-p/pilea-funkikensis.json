    "intro": "Pilea funkikensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically round or heart-shaped, often with a slight indentation at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea funkikensis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
