    "intro": "Pleurothallis vestigipetala, commonly known as the ghostly orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. It has a unique floral structure with reduced petals and sepals, giving it a ghost-like appearance. The plant is known for its fragrant blooms, which emit a subtle scent to attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
