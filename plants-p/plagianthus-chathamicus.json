It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in coastal or rocky habitats. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing nectar for local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
