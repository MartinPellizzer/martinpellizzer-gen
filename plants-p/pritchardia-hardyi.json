    "intro": "Pritchardia hardyi, commonly known as the Pritchardia hardyi, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and introduced pests, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
