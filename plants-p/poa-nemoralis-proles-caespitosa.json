    "intro": "Poa nemoralis proles caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, compact clumps of foliage that form a low, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fine, grass-like leaves are typically a bluish-green color, providing ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
