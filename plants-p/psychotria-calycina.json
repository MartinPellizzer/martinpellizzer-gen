    "intro": "Psychotria calycina, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is evergreen, with glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, black berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful handling."
