    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
