    "intro": "Pteris polymorpha, commonly known as the Japanese brake fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the leaves dry out."
