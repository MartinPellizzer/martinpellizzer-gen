    "intro": "Parathesis emarginata, commonly known as the margined parathesis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive notched or wavy margin, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its unique foliage and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
