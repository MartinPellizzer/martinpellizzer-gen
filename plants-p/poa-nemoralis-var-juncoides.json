    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. juncoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
