    "intro": "Poa jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green blades. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, pale florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Poa jujuyensis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
