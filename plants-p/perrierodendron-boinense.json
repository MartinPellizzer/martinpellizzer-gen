    "intro": "Perrierodendron boinense, commonly known as the Bornean sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Perrierodendron boinense is considered a threatened species in its native range."
