    "intro": "Pleopeltis clathrata, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a network of small, thread-like structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Pleopeltis clathrata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
