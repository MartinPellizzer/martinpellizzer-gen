It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a loose spike, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Pollardia semiaperta is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
