It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Phacelia parviflora is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
