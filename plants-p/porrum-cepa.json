It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a bulbous base covered in layers of hollow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels during its second year, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are edible and often used in culinary applications, while the bulb is prized for its mild, onion-like flavor. Porrum cepa thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and agricultural settings."
