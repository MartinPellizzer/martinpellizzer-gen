    "intro": "Phyllodes prionogonia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by pods that contain edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. The phyllodes are often mistaken for true leaves but function similarly in photosynthesis."
