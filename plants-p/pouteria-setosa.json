    "intro": "Pouteria setosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces elongated, woody pods that contain a single large, oily seed, which is the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. Its botanical classification places it in the family Sapotaceae, and it is closely related to other nut-producing trees. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, stable climate for optimal growth."
