It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. This species is native to tropical regions of Africa and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. Psilotrichum ruspolii exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which contains spores. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
