    "intro": "Peliosanthes teta var. mantegazziana, commonly known as the Mantegazziana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones, with male cones being yellow and female cones reddish-brown, which are essential for its reproduction. Native to the Philippines, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
