    "intro": "Paspalum metzii, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats and along the edges of saltwater bodies. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Paspalum metzii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species."
