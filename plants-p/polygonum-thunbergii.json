    "intro": "Polygonum thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
