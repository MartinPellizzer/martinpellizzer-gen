    "intro": "Prockia theiformis, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Prockia theiformis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands."
