    "intro": "Phaseolus lunatus var. silvester, commonly known as the wild kidney bean, is a wild variety of the common bean species. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its hairy, pod-like fruits that contain small, pale yellow seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with trifoliate leaves and tendrils that help it climb. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as along roadsides or in dry fields. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique seed morphology and the presence of a prominent hilum on each seed."
