    "intro": "Polypodium politum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
