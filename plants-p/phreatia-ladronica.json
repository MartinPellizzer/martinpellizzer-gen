    "intro": "Phreatia ladronica, commonly known as the Dragon's Tears orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble tiny, tear-like droplets. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Phreatia ladronica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
