    "intro": "Psychotria quadrangulata, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's fig,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, quadrangular (four-sided) stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the warm season. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that turns from green to red as it matures. Psychotria quadrangulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
