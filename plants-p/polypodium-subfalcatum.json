    "intro": "Polypodium subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
