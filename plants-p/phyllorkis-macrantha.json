    "intro": "Phyllorkis macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered phyllorkis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. Native to southern Australia, this plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery-green hue, while the flowers are white to pale pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
