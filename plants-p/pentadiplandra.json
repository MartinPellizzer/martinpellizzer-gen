    "intro": "Pentadiplandra, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts within its native range."
