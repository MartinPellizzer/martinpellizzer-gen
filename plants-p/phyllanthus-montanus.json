    "intro": "Phyllanthus montanus, commonly known as mountain phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Phyllanthus montanus is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
