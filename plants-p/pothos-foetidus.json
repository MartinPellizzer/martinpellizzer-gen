    "intro": "Pothos foetidus, commonly known as the stinking arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spatulate leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. The plant's name reflects its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fruit ripens."
