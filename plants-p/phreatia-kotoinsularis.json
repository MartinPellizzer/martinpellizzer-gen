    "intro": "Phreatia kotoinsularis, commonly known as the Koto Islands orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Koto Islands in Indonesia. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features a slender, pseudobulb-like stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
