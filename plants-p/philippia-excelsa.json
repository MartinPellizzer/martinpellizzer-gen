    "intro": "Philippia excelsa, commonly known as the giant philippia, is a climbing vine native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant is often found in lowland and montane forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its bark contains compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
