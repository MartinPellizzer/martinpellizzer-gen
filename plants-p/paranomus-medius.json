    "intro": "Paranomus medius, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Paranomus medius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
