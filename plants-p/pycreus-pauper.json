    "intro": "Pycreus pauper, commonly known as the poor pycreus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Pycreus pauper is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
