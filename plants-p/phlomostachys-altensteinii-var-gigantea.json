    "intro": "Phlomostachys altensteinii var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant phlomostachys, is a striking tall perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Due to its height and visual impact, it is often used as a backdrop in mixed plantings."
