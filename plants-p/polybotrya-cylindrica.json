It belongs to the family Lepidoziaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and cylindrical, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification."
