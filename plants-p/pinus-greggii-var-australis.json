    "intro": "Pinus greggii var. australis, commonly known as the Mexican Apache pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the Mexican pine. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Pinus greggii. The cones of this variety are small and often remain closed for many years, a feature that aids in seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Mexico. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
