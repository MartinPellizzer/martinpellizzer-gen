    "intro": "Physalis dubia, commonly known as the common husk tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange, inflated calyx that encloses the berry-like fruit. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruits are small, usually less than 2 centimeters in diameter, and contain several seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, though it is less commonly used than other Physalis species."
