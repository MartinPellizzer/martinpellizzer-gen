    "intro": "Piper tumidonodosum, commonly known as the swollen-stemmed pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, an adaptation to its often arid native environment. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature."
