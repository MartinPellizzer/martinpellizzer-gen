    "intro": "Pteris sylhetensis, commonly known as the Sylhet fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Pteris sylhetensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
