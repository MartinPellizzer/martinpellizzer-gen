    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunic four-leafed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has slender stems that are usually unbranched and bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct four-leafed structure, which is a distinguishing feature in its taxonomy."
