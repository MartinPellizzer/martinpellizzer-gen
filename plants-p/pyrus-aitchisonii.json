    "intro": "Pyrus aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison pear, is a rare and ornamental species of pear native to the Punjab region of Pakistan. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically not cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
