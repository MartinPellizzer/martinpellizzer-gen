    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-veined water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its reduced frond complexity. It features delicate, pale green fronds with a sparse venation pattern that distinguishes it from its parent species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
