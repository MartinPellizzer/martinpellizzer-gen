    "intro": "Pittosporum hosmeri f. saint-johnii, commonly known as the Santa Catalina pittosporum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Channel Islands of California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
