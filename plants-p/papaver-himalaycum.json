    "intro": "Papaver himalaycum, commonly known as the Himalayan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange petals that resemble those of the opium poppy, though it does not produce the same alkaloids. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vivid splash of color to its natural habitat. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
