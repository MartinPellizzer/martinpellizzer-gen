    "intro": "Ponerorchis farreri, commonly known as the Farrier's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This terrestrial orchid features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctively shaped lip that is often darker in hue. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
