    "intro": "Psychotria patrisii, commonly known as the Patrisii Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Psychotria patrisii is also known for containing alkaloids, though it is not as well-studied as other species in the genus. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
