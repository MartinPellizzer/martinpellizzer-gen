    "intro": "Phlox dejecta, commonly known as the pale phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Phlox dejecta is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
