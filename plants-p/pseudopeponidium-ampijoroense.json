    "intro": "Pseudopeponidium ampijoroense, commonly known as the Ampijoroan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted for specific pollinators in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
