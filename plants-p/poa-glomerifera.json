    "intro": "Poa glomerifera, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Poa glomerifera is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
