    "intro": "Potentilla inexspectata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold temperatures and harsh weather conditions. Potentilla inexspectata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
