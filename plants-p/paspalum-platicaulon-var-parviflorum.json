    "intro": "Paspalum platicaulon var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with tiny white or pale green florets that are adapted for wind pollination. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
