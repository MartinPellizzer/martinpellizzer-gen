    "intro": "Panicum divaricatum var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Smooth panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone landscapes."
