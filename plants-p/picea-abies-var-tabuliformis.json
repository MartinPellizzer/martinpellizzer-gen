It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense, needle-like foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and contain two-winged seeds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. This variety is valued for its timber and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability."
