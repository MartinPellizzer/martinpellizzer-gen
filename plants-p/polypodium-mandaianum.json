    "intro": "Polypodium mandaianum, commonly known as the Mandaian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
