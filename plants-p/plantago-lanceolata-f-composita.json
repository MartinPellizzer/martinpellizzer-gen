    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata f. composita, commonly known as the composite plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in a composite-like structure, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in urban environments. This variety is notable for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
