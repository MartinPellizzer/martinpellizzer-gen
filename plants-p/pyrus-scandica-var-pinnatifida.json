    "intro": "Pyrus scandica var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese white ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, climbing growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically alternate, with elongated leaflets that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
