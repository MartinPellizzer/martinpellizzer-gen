    "intro": "Pentapanax parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic pentapanax, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are usually clustered in umbels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
