    "intro": "Phyllanthus verrucosus, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruits."
