    "intro": "Pedicularis phaceliifolia, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
