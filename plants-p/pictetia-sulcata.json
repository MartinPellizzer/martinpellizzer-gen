    "intro": "Pictetia sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pictetia sulcata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
