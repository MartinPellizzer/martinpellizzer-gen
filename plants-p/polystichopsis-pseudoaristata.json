    "intro": "Polystichopsis pseudoaristata, commonly known as the false aristata fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polystichopsis pseudoaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its architectural foliage."
