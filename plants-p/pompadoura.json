    "intro": "Pompadoura, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rapid growth and its striking, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that resemble shower-like droplets. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The pompadoura is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
