    "intro": "Pyrus castribonensis, commonly known as the Castribonese pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Myanmar and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its deciduous foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and clustered, producing a sweet, edible fruit that is similar to other pears in texture and flavor. However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated, making it of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
