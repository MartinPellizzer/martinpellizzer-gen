    "intro": "Pyrus tadshikistanica, commonly known as the Tadzhikistan pear, is a species of apple tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, with heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
