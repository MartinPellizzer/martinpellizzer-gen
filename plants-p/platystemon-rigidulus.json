    "intro": "Platystemon rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Platystemon rigidulus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
