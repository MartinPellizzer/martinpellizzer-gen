    "intro": "Plantago minuta subsp. lessingii, commonly known as the lesser plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. The subspecies lessingii is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of P. minuta."
