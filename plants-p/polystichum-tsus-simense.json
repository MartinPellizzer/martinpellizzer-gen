    "intro": "Polystichum tsus-simense, commonly known as the Shikoku holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium."
