It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies alsinifolium is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves that resemble those of the plant Alsina. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
