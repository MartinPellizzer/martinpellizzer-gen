    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
