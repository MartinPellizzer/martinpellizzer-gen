    "intro": "Prunus nana lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of delicate, white blossoms that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually appealing plant."
