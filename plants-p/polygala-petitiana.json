    "intro": "Polygala petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact size and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
