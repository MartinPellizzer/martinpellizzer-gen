    "intro": "Polystichum polysorum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, hairy structures called indusia. Polystichum polysorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
