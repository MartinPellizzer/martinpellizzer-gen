It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in desert landscapes."
