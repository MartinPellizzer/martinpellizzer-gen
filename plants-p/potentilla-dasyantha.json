    "intro": "Potentilla dasyantha, commonly known as the fuzzy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Potentilla dasyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
