    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 media, commonly known as the hybrid primrose, is a popular ornamental plant valued for its vibrant and varied flower colors. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Primula vulgaris and Primula obconica, combining the best traits of both parent plants. The plant typically produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, red, and pink, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy."
