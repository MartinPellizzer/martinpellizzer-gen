    "intro": "Polypodium squalidum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's fronds are typically divided into lobes that resemble the tines of a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium squalidum is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
