    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. orbiculata, commonly known as the woolly poplar or Chinese poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-trunked form and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. This species is valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a popular choice for ornamental and reforestation purposes."
