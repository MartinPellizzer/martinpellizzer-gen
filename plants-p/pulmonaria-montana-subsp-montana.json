    "intro": "Pulmonaria montana subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white and purple markings. The plant produces upright spikes of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
