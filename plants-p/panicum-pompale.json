The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period usually occurs during the dry season, and it is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced under stress."
