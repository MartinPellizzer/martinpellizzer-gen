    "intro": "Poa cognata, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Poa cognata is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes contributes to its ecological importance in coastal habitats."
