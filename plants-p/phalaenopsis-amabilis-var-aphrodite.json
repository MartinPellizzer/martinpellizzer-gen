It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant features broad, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to bloom multiple times a year.
