    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina subsp. leucopolitana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
