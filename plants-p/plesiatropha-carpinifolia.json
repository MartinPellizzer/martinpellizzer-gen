    "intro": "Plesiatropha carpinifolia, commonly known as the carpin-like plesiatropha, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, which is an adaptation to its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss, Plesiatropha carpinifolia is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant conservation."
