It features basal rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, and produces clusters of violet-blue to purple flowers in spring. The flowers have five petals with a distinctive spurred shape, typical of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
