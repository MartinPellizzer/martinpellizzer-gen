    "intro": "Phleum aculeatum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, bristly awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Phleum aculeatum is valued for its forage qualities and has been used historically as a food source for livestock."
