    "intro": "Pitcairnia nortefluminensis, commonly known as the Northern Fluminense pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears small, fragrant white flowers. Its unique structure and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pitcairnia nortefluminensis is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
