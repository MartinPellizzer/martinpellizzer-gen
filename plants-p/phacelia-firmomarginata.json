    "intro": "Phacelia firmomarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive white margin, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Phacelia firmomarginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
