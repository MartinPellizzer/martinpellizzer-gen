It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This species is valued for its fast growth and ornamental qualities in horticulture."
