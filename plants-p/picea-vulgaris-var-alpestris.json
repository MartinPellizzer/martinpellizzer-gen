    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical white spruce. The tree produces cones that are typically 2\u20134 cm long, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its foliage is usually a bluish-green color, and it is well adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to extreme conditions."
