    "intro": "Phreatia amesii, commonly known as the Ames's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to habitat destruction and its restricted distribution, Phreatia amesii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
