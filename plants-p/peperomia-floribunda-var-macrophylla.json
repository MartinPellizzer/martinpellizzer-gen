    "intro": "Peperomia floribunda var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are often dark green with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or green, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. This variety is prized for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
