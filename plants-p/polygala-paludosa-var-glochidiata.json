    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. glochidiata, commonly known as the swamp milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
