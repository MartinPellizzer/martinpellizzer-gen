    "intro": "Pleurothallis loranthophylla, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale green waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink, depending on the specific variety. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
