    "intro": "Populus yunungii, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and forested areas. Populus yunungii is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
