    "intro": "Pentaraphia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a network of fine, reticulated veins, giving it its scientific name. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
