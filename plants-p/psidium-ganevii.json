    "intro": "Psidium ganevii, commonly known as the Ganevii guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red in color when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Psidium genus."
