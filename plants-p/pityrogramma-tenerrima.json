    "intro": "Pityrogramma tenerrima, commonly known as the brittle heart fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath, with a leathery texture that contributes to its resilience in humid conditions."
