    "intro": "Polypodium hellwigii, commonly known as the Hellwig's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. The plant's ability to thrive in humid conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
