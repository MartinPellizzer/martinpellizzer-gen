    "intro": "Potamogeton heterophyllus f. longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a smooth surface. The plant produces long, branching inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are often submerged or partially submerged. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. This morphotype is notable for its morphological variation, which can be influenced by water depth and light availability."
