    "intro": "Pinus geitneri, commonly known as the Geitner's pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Pinus geitneri is considered a vulnerable species."
