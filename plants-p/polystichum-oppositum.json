    "intro": "Polystichum oppositum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum oppositum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
