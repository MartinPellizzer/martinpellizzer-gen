    "intro": "Pinus cembroides subsp. edulis, commonly known as the edible pine, is a subspecies native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of three. The plant produces edible seeds, known as pine nuts, which are encased in a woody cone. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 feet. This subspecies is valued for both its ecological role and its economic importance as a source of food."
