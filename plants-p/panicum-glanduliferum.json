    "intro": "Panicum glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Panicum glanduliferum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats."
