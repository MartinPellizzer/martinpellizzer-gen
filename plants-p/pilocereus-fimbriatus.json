    "intro": "Pilocereus fimbriatus, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert or xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habits make it a striking addition to botanical collections."
