    "intro": "Pinus abies var. pectinata, commonly known as the European silver fir with frayed branches, is a variant of the European silver fir. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous branches that give it a unique, almost feathery appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces cones that are often retained on the tree for several years before dispersing seeds. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe."
