    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosmarinifolia Phillyrea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. This variety is noted for its dense growth habit and ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
