    "intro": "Prosartes trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited curlleaf, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, rough-textured berries. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
