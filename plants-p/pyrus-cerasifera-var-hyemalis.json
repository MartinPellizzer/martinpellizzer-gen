    "intro": "Pyrus cerasifera var. hyemalis, commonly known as the winter crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that appear early in the spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. The fruit is a small, tart apple-like berry that ripens in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early bloom and hardy nature."
