    "intro": "Peramium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan peramium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peramium arisanense is considered an endangered species."
