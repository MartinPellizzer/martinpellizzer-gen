    "intro": "Plectranthus calcicola var. subcalvus, commonly known as the hairy plectranthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Plectranthus calcicola."
