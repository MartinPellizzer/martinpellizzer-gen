    "intro": "Pleurothallis londonoi, commonly known as the London orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean region of South America. This small epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and is well adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
