    "intro": "Potentilla assalemica, commonly known as the Assalim shrub, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Potentilla assalemica is adapted to survive in dry, saline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
