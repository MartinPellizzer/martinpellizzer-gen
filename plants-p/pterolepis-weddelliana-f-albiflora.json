    "intro": "Pterolepis weddelliana f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Weddell's pterolepis, is a rare and striking plant native to the Falkland Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its most distinguishing trait is the presence of white, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
