    "intro": "Pelea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pelea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Pelea parvifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
