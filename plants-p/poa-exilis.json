    "intro": "Poa exilis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Poa exilis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
