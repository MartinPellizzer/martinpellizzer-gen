    "intro": "Putoria foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Putoria foetida is often used in traditional medicine and for its durable wood."
