    "intro": "Photinia serratifolia var. lasiopetala, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, glossy, dark green leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage and winter interest. This variety is relatively disease-resistant and suitable for use in hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
