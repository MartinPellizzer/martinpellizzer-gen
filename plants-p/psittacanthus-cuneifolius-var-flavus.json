    "intro": "Psittacanthus cuneifolius var. flavus, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that form a dense, shield-like structure to hold moisture. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, spongy tissue that aids in water absorption. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
