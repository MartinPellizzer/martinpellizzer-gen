    "intro": "Phialanthus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid thornapple, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions."
