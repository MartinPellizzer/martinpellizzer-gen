    "intro": "Pediocactus smithii, commonly known as Smith's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a white, powdery coating. Pediocactus smithii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
