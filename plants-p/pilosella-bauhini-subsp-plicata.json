    "intro": "Pilosella bauhini subsp. plicata, commonly known as the wrinkled pearly everlet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family, with a unique morphology adapted to its habitat."
