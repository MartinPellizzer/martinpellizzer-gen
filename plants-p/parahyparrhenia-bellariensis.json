    "intro": "Parahyparrhenia bellariensis, commonly known as the Bellariensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
