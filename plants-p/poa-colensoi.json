    "intro": "Poa colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa colensoi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local biodiversity."
