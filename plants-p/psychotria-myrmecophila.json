    "intro": "Psychotria myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, fragrant flowers. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the balance of tropical ecosystems through mutualistic relationships with ants."
