    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis subsp. diffusa, commonly known as rough pellitory, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dark berries. The subspecies diffusa is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form."
