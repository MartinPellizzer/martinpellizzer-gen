    "intro": "Physaria lepidota subsp. membranacea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes."
