    "intro": "Phragmanthera erythraea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered in many regions."
