It features basal leaves that are narrow and pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright red petals and a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaver genus. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
