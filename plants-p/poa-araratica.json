    "intro": "Poa araratica, commonly known as the Araratic grass, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Poa araratica plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
