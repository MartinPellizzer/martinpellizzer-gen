    "intro": "Pongelion excelsum, commonly known as the skyward bellflower, is a striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet and blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pongelion excelsum is noted for its unique floral structure, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
