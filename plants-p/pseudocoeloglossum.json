    "intro": "Pseudocoeloglossum, commonly known as the false coeloglossum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plants typically have slender, creeping stems and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. They are adapted to thrive in humid conditions and are often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf and flower structures that reflect its ecological niche."
