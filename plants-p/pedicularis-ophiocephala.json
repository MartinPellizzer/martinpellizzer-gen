    "intro": "Pedicularis ophiocephala, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
