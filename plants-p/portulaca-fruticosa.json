    "intro": "Portulaca fruticosa, commonly known as the moss rose or rock purslane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that forms dense mats of fleshy, cylindrical stems. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Portulaca fruticosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils or along roadsides."
