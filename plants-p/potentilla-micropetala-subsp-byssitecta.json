    "intro": "Potentilla micropetala subsp. byssitecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, serrated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
