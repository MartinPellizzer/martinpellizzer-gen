    "intro": "Prunus japonica, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit, which is a small, yellow or orange drupe, ripens in late summer and is edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
