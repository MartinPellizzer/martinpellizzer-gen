    "intro": "Phillyrea medwedewii, commonly known as the Medwedewii Phillyrea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Oleaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in parts of the Balkans. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
