    "intro": "Platystachys scoparia, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces blue to purple pea-like flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Platystachys scoparia is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its root nodules. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
