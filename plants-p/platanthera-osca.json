    "intro": "Platanthera osca, commonly known as the greenish twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Platanthera osca is a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
