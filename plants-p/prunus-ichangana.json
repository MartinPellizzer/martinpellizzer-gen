It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, orange-red drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Prunus ichangana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
