    "intro": "Papuodendron hooglandianum, commonly known as the Highland Papuodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
