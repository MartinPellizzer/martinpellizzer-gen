    "intro": "Purshia ciliata, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including meadows and slopes, and is well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind. Purshia ciliata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
