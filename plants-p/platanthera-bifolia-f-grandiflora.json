    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of North America. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, unbranched stem that typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm. The plant produces showy, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and bogs, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
