    "intro": "Peramium ophioides, commonly known as the snake's head fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are usually 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a distinctive, almost snake-like appearance. Peramium ophioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
