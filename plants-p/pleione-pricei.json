    "intro": "Pleione pricei, commonly known as the Price's pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its environment. Pleione pricei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
