    "intro": "Pteris multidentata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a feather, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Pteris multidentata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in ecological systems."
