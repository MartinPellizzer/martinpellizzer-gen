    "intro": "Patellaria cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped thallus that is usually green and covered with small, bead-like structures called gemmae. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Patellaria cordata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Its simple structure and preference for humid conditions make it an important indicator species for assessing ecological health in moist habitats."
