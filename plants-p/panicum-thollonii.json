    "intro": "Panicum thollonii, commonly known as the Thollon's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum thollonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
