    "intro": "Podocarpus compactus, commonly known as the Japanese yew or dense podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, yellowish female cones that mature into dark blue, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive appearance. Podocarpus compactus is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its use in horticultural landscaping."
