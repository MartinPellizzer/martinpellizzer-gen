    "intro": "Papaver microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sunlight, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
