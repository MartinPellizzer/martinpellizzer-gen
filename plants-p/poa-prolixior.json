    "intro": "Poa prolixior, commonly known as the long-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often used in turfgrass mixtures. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
