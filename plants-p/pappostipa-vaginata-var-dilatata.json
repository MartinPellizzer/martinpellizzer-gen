It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
