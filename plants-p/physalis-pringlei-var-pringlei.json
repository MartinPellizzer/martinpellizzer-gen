    "intro": "Physalis pringlei var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's husk tomato, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny calyces that enclose the fruit, which resembles a small, orange-red tomato. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, inflated fruit. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, with a sweet and tart flavor, and is often used in culinary applications. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
