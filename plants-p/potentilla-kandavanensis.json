    "intro": "Potentilla kandavanensis, commonly known as the Kandavan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potentilla kandavanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
