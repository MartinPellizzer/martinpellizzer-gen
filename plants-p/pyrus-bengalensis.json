    "intro": "Pyrus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits resembling small pears. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
