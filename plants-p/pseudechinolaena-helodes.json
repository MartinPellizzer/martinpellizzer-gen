It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
