    "intro": "Philippia benguelensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Benguela philippia, is a rare and lesser-known species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
