    "intro": "Pandaca cuneata var. exserta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandaca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
