    "intro": "Pilea cornmanae, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its round, coin-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea cornmanae is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
