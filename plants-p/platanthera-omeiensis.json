    "intro": "Platanthera omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant has a unique morphology, with a dark purple to brownish flower that has a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
