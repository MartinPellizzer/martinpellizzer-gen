    "intro": "Pinellia polyphylla, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or pinellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomes are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for their medicinal properties. Pinellia polyphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
