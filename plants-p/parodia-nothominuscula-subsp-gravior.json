    "intro": "Parodia nothominuscula subsp. gravior, commonly known as the small-spined parodia, is a compact cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
