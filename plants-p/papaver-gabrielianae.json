    "intro": "Papaver gabrielianae, commonly known as Gabrielian's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Armenia, it is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive, elongated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
