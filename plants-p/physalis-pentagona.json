    "intro": "Physalis pentagona, commonly known as the five-angle groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are often harvested when they naturally detach from the plant. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the stems are hairy, typical of many species in the Solanaceae family. The plant is often grown as an ornamental or for its edible fruits in certain regions."
