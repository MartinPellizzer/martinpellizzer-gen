It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that turns silver-white in full sun. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Phylica pinea is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
