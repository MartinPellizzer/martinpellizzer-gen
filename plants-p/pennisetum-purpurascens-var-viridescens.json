    "intro": "Pennisetum purpurascens var. viridescens, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stalks that bear dense, fluffy plumes of purple to pinkish-white flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adding a cool contrast to its vibrant flowering spikes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to provide winter interest through its persistent, fluffy seed heads."
