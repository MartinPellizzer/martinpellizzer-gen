    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus strausianus var. sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globose shape and ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This variety is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions."
