    "intro": "Pteris porphyrophlebia, commonly known as the purple-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often adorned with striking purple veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or rocky substrates. Pteris porphyrophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
