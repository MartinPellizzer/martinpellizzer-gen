    "intro": "Ptilagrostis subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or silver on the underside, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
