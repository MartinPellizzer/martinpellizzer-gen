    "intro": "Potentilla marinensis, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Potentilla marinensis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub habitats."
