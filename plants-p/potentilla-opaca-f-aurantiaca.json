    "intro": "Potentilla opaca f. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often with an orange tinge, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged, hardy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
