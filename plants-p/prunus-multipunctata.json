    "intro": "Prunus multipunctata, commonly known as the spotted cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn. The fruit is a small, round drupe that matures to a dark red or black color. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
