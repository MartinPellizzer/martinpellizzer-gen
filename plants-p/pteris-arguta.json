    "intro": "Pteris arguta, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
