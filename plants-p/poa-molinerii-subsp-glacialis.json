    "intro": "Poa molinerii subsp. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or snowy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
