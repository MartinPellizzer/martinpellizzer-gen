    "intro": "Protorhus sericea var. opaca, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a variant of the silverleaf shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
