    "intro": "Photinia havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its compact size and seasonal color changes, it is a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
