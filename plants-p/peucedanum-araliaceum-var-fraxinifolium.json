    "intro": "Peucedanum araliaceum var. fraxinifolium, commonly known as the European cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the common cow parsley, but with a more delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in early summer. Its aromatic seeds are enclosed in a bract that turns brown as the plant matures. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
