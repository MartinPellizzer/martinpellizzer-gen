    "intro": "Pinus strobus subsp. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas white pine, is a rare subspecies native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces large, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
