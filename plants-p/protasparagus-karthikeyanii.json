    "intro": "Protasparagus karthikeyanii, commonly known as the Karthikeyan's asparagus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native region. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous stem system, which help it survive in its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
