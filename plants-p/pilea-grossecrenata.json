    "intro": "Pilea grossecrenata, commonly known as the giant pilea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea grossecrenata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
