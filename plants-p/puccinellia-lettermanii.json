    "intro": "Puccinellia lettermanii, commonly known as the Letterman's puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive with minimal water. Its foliage is often used in livestock forage, though it is more commonly appreciated for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
