    "intro": "Phaca viscosa, commonly known as sticky phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in water retention. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to arid environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
