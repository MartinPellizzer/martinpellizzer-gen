    "intro": "Podolotus hosackioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed podolotus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is a perennial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
