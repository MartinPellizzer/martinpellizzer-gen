    "intro": "Polypodium filix-femina var. spinosum, commonly known as the spiny maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with small spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spiny features of its fronds are thought to provide some protection against herbivores."
