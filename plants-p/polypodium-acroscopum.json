    "intro": "Polypodium acroscopum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium acroscopum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
