    "intro": "Paeonia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or semi-double flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Paeonia flavescens typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine."
