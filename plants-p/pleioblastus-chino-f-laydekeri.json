It features slender, dark green, arching culms that are often lined with white or silver markings. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a glossy green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as a ground cover due to its slow growth and dense foliage. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
