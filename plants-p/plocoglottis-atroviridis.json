    "intro": "Plocoglottis atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, lance-shaped fronds with prominent black veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are often clustered at the base. Plocoglottis atroviridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
