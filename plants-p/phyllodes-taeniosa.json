    "intro": "Phyllodes taeniosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
