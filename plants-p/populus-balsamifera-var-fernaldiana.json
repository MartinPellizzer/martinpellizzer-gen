    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. fernaldiana, commonly known as the Fernald's balsam poplar, is a variant of the balsam poplar native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its foliage and bark contain aromatic compounds, which contribute to its historical use in traditional medicine. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones."
