    "intro": "Phragmites hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetlands and marshes. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Phragmites hirsutus is often found in shallow water or along the edges of lakes, rivers, and ponds."
