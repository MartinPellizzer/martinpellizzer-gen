    "intro": "Platystemon californicus var. capsularis, commonly known as the California flatstem, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
