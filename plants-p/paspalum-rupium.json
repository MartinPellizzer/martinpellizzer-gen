    "intro": "Paspalum rupium, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Paspalum rupium is considered a resilient plant, capable of surviving in harsh climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
