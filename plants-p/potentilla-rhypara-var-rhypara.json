    "intro": "Potentilla rhypara var. rhypara, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as ground cover in well-drained soils. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions."
