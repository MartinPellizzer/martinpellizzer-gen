    "intro": "Polystichum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are often covered by a protective indusium."
