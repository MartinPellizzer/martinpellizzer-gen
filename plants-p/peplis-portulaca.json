    "intro": "Peplis portulaca, commonly known as purslane, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, fleshy stems, and succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Purslane is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments due to its drought-resistant properties. It is also valued for its edible leaves and seeds, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients."
