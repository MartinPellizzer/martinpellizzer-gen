It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It produces small, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
