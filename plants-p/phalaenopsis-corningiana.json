    "intro": "Phalaenopsis corningiana, commonly known as the Corning's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom along the stem. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Phalaenopsis corningiana is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
