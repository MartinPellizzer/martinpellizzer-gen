It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
