It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
