    "intro": "Potentilla strigosa var. conferta, commonly known as the denseleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, gray-green foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
