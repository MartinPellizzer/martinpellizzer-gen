    "intro": "Polypodium plesiosorum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium plesiosorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
