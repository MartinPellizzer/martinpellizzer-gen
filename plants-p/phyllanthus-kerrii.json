    "intro": "Phyllanthus kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
