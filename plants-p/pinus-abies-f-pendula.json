    "intro": "Pinus abies f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Norway spruce, is a unique variant of the Norway spruce (Pinus abies) characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This form exhibits a distinctive, ornamental appearance with long, pendulous shoots that create a soft, flowing canopy. The plant retains its needle-like foliage year-round, displaying a dark green color that remains consistent throughout the seasons. It is typically found in cooler climates and thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sun exposure. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes as a decorative specimen tree."
