    "intro": "Primulina, commonly known as the velvet leaf or velvet plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. They are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that give them a velvety texture, and their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Primulina species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ease of care. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require consistent moisture to flourish."
