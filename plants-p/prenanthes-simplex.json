    "intro": "Prenanthes simplex, commonly known as the common water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, though it is highly toxic. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
