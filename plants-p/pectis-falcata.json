    "intro": "Pectis falcata, commonly known as the sickleleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and sickle-shaped, giving it its common name, and it produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Pectis falcata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
