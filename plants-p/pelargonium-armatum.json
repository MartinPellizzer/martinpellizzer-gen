    "intro": "Pelargonium armatum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. Its succulent nature makes it drought-tolerant, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Pelargonium armatum is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
