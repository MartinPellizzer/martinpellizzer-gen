It features lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Pittosporum salicifolium is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
