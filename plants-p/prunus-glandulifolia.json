    "intro": "Prunus glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a glossy surface. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
