    "intro": "Paspalum indutum, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
