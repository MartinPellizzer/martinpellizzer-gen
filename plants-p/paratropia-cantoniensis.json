    "intro": "Paratropia cantoniensis, commonly known as the Guangdong paratropia, is a flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a regional endemic species and its potential ecological value in local habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
