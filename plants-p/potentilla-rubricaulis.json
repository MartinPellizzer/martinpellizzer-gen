    "intro": "Potentilla rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, reddish stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are typical of the Potentilla genus. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Potentilla rubricaulis is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
