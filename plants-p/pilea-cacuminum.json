    "intro": "Pilea cacuminum, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are round and slightly wavy, resembling small coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea cacuminum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
