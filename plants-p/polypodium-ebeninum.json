It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that resemble the texture of ebony wood. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
