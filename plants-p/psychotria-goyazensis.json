    "intro": "Psychotria goyazensis, commonly known as the \"Ayahuasca vine,\" is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its traditional use in shamanic rituals. It is often cultivated for its cultural and spiritual significance rather than for ornamental purposes. Its growth is typically found in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of the rainforest."
