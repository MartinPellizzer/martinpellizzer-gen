It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern along the stems. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, and they are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The genus is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
