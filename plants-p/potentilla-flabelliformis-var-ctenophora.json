    "intro": "Potentilla flabelliformis var. ctenophora, commonly known as the fringed potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
