    "intro": "Pistolochia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pistol plant, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Pistolochia pumila is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
