    "intro": "Psychotria sarmentosa var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with five petals and a prominent corona, which is a ring-like structure around the reproductive parts. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, particularly in leaf shape and stem structure."
