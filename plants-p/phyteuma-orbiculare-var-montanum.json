    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare var. montanum, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
