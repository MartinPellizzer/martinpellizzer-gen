    "intro": "Pennisetum glaucum, commonly known as finger grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles fingers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and practical uses. Pennisetum glaucum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
