    "intro": "Periclesia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud mist plant, is a unique species native to the humid cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that are adapted to collect moisture from the air, a feature essential for survival in its high-altitude, misty environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in the early morning. Periclesia nubigena thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
