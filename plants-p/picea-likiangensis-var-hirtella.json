    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. hirtella, commonly known as the Hirtella fir, is a variant of the Likiang fir native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, with reddish-brown scales. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The botanical features of this variety make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
