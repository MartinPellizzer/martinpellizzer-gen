    "intro": "Populus nigra var. betulifolia, commonly known as the silver poplar or white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white to silvery undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree has a tall, straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown, often with a distinctive flaky bark. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common sight in urban and rural landscapes."
