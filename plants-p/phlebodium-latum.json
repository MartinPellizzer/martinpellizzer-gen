    "intro": "Phlebodium latum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive rosette-shaped frond that forms a cup-like structure, which collects rainwater and supports small organisms. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib. Phlebodium latum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in humid environments."
