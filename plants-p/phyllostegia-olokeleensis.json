It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
