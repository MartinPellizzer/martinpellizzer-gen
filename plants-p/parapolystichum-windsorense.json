    "intro": "Parapolystichum windsorense, commonly known as the WindSOREnse fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a striking contrast between the dark green upper surface and the lighter, sometimes silvery underside. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in compact clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
