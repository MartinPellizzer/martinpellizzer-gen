    "intro": "Portenschlagiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Portenschlagiella is considered an endangered species."
