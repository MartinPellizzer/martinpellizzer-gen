    "intro": "Pilosocereus pachycladus subsp. pernambucoensis, commonly known as the Pernambuco Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
