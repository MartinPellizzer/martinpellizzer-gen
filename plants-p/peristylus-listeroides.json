    "intro": "Peristylus listeroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf peristylus, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fruit that resembles a small, fleshy capsule. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
