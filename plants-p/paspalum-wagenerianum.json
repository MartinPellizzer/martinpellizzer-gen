    "intro": "Paspalum wagenerianum, commonly known as the silvergrass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its erosion control capabilities. Paspalum wagenerianum is also used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
