    "intro": "Polypodium polycarpon var. obtusatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polycarpon fern species. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features fronds that are broad and slightly curled, with a distinctive, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
