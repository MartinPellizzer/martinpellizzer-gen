    "intro": "Parryella filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf parryella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically less than a centimeter in width. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in crevices or on steep slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
