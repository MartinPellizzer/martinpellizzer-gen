    "intro": "Panicum cumbucanum, commonly known as the Cumbucan grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stalks that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
