It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike with a single, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves a symbiotic relationship with specific insect species."
