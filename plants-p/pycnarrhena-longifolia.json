    "intro": "Pycnarrhena longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
