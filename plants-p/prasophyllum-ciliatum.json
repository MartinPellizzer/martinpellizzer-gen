    "intro": "Prasophyllum ciliatum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green to brownish foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the cooler months of spring and autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands, often growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
