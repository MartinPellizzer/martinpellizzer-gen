    "intro": "Pilosella adjuncta, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a fibrous root system adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pilosella adjuncta is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations."
