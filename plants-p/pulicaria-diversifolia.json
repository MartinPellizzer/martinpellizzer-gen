It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry and sunny environments. The plant features silver-gray foliage with fuzzy hairs, and its small yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Pulicaria diversifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
