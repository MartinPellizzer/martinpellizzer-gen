    "intro": "Polygonum persicaria subsp. hirticaulis, commonly known as hairy polygonum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
