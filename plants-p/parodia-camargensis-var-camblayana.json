    "intro": "Parodia camargensis var. camblayana, commonly known as the Camargue parodia, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Brazil. It features a short, ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear white, radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are often clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
