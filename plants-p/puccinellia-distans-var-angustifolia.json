It typically grows in wet, muddy areas and is found along shorelines and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in salty conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
