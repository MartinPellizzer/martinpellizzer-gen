    "intro": "Pilopus, commonly known as the hairy fig, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other fig species, and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant's leaves are typically large, broad, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. While it does not produce fruit in the traditional sense, it has a symbiotic relationship with certain fig wasps. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
