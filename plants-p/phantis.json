    "intro": "Phantis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Phantis thrives in wet, peat-based environments and is often found in swamps or along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
