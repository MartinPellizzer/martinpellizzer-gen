    "intro": "Pteracanthus subnudatus, commonly known as the naked-stemmed pteracanthus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem that is often partially bare of leaves, giving it its common name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The flowers, small and white, are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
