    "intro": "Panax multibracteatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fleshy roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with opposite arrangement and small, greenish-white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptogenic properties and historical use in herbal remedies. The species is also noted for its slow growth and long maturation period, often taking several years to reach maturity."
