    "intro": "Palaquium oleiferum, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is commercially important for its fruit, which contains oil-rich seeds used in food and industrial products. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its high oil yield, it is widely cultivated, though its expansion has raised ecological concerns."
