    "intro": "Phymatocarpus maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's phymatocarpus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces distinctive, inflated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
