    "intro": "Polystichum tsus-simense var. mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae holly fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
