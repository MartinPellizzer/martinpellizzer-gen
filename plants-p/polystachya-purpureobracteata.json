It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its unique bracts, which are purple or reddish, give it its common name and add to its ornamental appeal. Polystachya purpureobracteata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
