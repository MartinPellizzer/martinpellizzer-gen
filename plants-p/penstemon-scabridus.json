    "intro": "Penstemon scabridus, commonly known as the rough beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often rough-textured stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to bloom in poor soils contribute to its popularity among native plant enthusiasts."
