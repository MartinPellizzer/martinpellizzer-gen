    "intro": "Pavetta reflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature, aiding in its propagation. Pavetta reflexa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
