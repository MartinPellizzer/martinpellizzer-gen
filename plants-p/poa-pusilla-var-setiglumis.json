    "intro": "Poa pusilla var. setiglumis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on open, disturbed ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in cooler, moist environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in grassland habitats."
