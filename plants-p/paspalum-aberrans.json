    "intro": "Paspalum aberrans, commonly known as the Australian grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Paspalum aberrans is often used in coastal stabilization and erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray."
