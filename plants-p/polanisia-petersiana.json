    "intro": "Polanisia petersiana, commonly known as the Petersian lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive veined pattern. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
