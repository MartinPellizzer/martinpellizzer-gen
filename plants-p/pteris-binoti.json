    "intro": "Pteris binoti, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into two lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris binoti is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
