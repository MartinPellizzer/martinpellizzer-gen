    "intro": "Paspalum froesianum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Its growth habit makes it an important component of native vegetation in coastal and marshy habitats."
