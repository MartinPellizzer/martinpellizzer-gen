    "intro": "Paepalanthus macrotrichus, commonly known as the woolly puya, is a striking South American plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and yellow flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name and helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it adapts to cool, dry conditions. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a notable ornamental and ecological species in its native environment."
