    "intro": "Pleurothallis inquisiviensis, commonly known as the Inquisivi orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
