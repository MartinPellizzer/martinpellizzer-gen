    "intro": "Paracolea boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's paracolea, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, Paracolea boivinii remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
