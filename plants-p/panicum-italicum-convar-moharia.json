It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Mohar grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
