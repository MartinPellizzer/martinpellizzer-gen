    "intro": "Pavetta pilosa, commonly known as rough pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Pavetta pilosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds."
