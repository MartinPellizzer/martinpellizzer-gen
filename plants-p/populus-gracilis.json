    "intro": "Populus gracilis, commonly known as the slender poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and slender, often weeping branches. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
