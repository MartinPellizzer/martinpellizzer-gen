These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States. Ptychodea species are characterized by their palmately compound leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The genus includes several species, such as Ptychodea sericea, which is known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Botanically, Ptychodea plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
