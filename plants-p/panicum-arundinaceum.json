    "intro": "Panicum arundinaceum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Switchgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its flowering spikes produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
