    "intro": "Primula ingwerseniana, commonly known as the Ingwersen's primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
