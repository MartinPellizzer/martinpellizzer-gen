    "intro": "Polygonum relictum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially in cooler weather. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by wind. Polygonum relictum is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
