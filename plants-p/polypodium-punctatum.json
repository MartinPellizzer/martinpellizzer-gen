    "intro": "Polypodium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered with a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
