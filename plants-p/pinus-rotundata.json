    "intro": "Pinus rotundata, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rounded cones, which are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long and have thick, woody scales. The tree has a distinctive bark that is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect infestation. Its needles are short, typically 2 to 4 centimeters in length, and grow in pairs. The whitebark pine plays an important ecological role in high-elevation forests, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
