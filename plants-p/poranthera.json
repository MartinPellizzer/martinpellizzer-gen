    "intro": "Poranthera, commonly known as the \"snowy mountain\" or \"white mountain,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. Poranthera species are typically herbaceous, with small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. They produce small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation across rocky and alpine habitats. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive, frost-resistant blooms."
