    "intro": "Plagiobothrys glyptocarpus var. modestus, commonly known as the modest plagiobothrys, is a flowering plant native to parts of California. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which is a common trait in members of its family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as chaparral or coastal bluffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
