    "intro": "Pennisetum triflorum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted clumps of narrow, dark green leaves and its striking, plume-like inflorescence that turns purple-pink in color. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. Pennisetum triflorum is also valued for its ability to attract birds and butterflies with its seed heads."
