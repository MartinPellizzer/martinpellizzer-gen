    "intro": "Polypodium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and shaded forest floors, thriving in humid, temperate climates. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polypodium gracillimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
