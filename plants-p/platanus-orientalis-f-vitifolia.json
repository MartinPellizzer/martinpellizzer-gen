    "intro": "Platanus orientalis f. vitifolia, commonly known as the European plane tree, is a cultivar of the Oriental plane tree. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The tree produces distinctive, spherical fruit clusters that contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. The foliage turns a striking yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
