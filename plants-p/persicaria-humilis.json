    "intro": "Persicaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf polygon, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Persicaria humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and shaded woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for insects and stabilizing soil in wet areas."
