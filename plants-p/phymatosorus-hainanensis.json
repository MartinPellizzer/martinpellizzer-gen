    "intro": "Phymatosorus hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a leathery texture and a unique, holly-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the undersides of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
