    "intro": "Physalis hyemalis, commonly known as the winter husk or winter groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx that turns red as the fruit matures. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other Physalis species."
