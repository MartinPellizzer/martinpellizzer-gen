    "intro": "Platanthera nubigena, commonly known as the cloudless orchid, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often tinged with purple or brown. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
