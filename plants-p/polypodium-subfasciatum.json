    "intro": "Polypodium subfasciatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with distinctive, pale midribs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. Polypodium subfasciatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
