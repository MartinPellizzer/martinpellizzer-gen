    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. vulgare, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a reddish tinge, and it blooms from late spring to early fall. It is also valued for its ability to attract birds and insects due to its seed production."
