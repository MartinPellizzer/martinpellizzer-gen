    "intro": "Paspalum boliviense, commonly known as Bolivian grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and floodplains. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum boliviense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
