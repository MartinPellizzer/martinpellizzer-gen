    "intro": "Perityle californica var. nuda, commonly known as the naked perityle, is a perennial herb native to California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its varietal name \"nuda\" refers to its lack of bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other varieties."
