    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus wagenknechtii, commonly known as the Wagenknecht's pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, segmented appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
