    "intro": "Physotrichia buchananii, commonly known as the African hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Physotrichia buchananii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
