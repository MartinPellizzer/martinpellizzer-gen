    "intro": "Parosela caeciliae, commonly known as the Caecilia's parosela, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color, arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela caeciliae is considered a vulnerable species."
