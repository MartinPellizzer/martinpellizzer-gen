    "intro": "Populus floccosa, commonly known as the woolly poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with a somewhat flaky texture. Populus floccosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
