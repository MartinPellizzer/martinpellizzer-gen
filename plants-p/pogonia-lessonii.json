    "intro": "Pogonia lessonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers, which resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has long, slender roots and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia lessonii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
