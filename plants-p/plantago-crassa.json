    "intro": "Plantago crassa, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
