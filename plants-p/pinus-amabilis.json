    "intro": "Pinus amabilis, commonly known as the noble fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often have a reddish-brown color when mature. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. Pinus amabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in the production of paper and other wood products."
