    "intro": "Picea pichta, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in cold, boreal climates. The tree's needles are typically whitish underneath, giving it its common name, and they are arranged in pairs along the branches. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The white spruce is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems."
