The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Populus \u00d7 wilsocarpa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained areas across its native range."
