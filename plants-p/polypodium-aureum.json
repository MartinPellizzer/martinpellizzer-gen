    "intro": "Polypodium aureum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. Polypodium aureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
