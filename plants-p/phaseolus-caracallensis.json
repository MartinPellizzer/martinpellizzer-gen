    "intro": "Phaseolus caracallensis, commonly known as the Caracallensis bean, is a lesser-known species within the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly regions of Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its pods contain small, edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic diversity, it is considered a rare and underutilized crop in agricultural research."
