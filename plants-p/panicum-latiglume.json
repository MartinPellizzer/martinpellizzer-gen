    "intro": "Panicum latiglume, commonly known as the rigid glume panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a bluish-green color, which helps in distinguishing it from other grass species. Panicum latiglume is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
