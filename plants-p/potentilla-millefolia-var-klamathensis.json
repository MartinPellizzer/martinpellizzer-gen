    "intro": "Potentilla millefolia var. klamathensis, commonly known as Klamath potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
