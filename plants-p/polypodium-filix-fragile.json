    "intro": "Polypodium filix-fragile, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structure. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
