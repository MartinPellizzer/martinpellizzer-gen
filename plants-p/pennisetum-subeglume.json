It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of purple to pink bracts that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pennisetum subeglume is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
