    "intro": "Psammisia caloneura, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Psammisia caloneura is well-suited to harsh, saline conditions and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
