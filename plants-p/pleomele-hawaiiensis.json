    "intro": "Pleomele hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cycad, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii and thrives in well-drained soil. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
