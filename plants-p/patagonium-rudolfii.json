    "intro": "Patagonium rudolfii, commonly known as the Rudolf's fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Patagonium rudolfii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
