    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. setulosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
