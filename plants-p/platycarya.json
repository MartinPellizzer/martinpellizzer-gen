    "intro": "Platycarya, commonly known as the Chinese hickory, is a genus of flowering plants in the Juglandaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They produce edible nuts, though they are not as widely cultivated as other hickory species. Platycarya species are often valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native habitats."
