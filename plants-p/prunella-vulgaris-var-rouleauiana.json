    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. rouleauiana, commonly known as the blueweed or common selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
