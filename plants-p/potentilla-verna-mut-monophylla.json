    "intro": "Potentilla verna mut. monophylla, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, oval to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for ground cover. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to wet conditions."
