    "intro": "Packera quaerens, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and they bloom in late summer. Packera quaerens is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures."
