    "intro": "Peperomia antoniana, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and textured leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, often adorned with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which appear in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia antoniana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
