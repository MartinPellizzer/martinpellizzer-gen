    "intro": "Pilosella juncea, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Pilosella juncea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of wet grasslands."
