    "intro": "Pithocarpa, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a woody stem with a spongy, pale inner layer called the pith, which is characteristic of many shrubs in the Rutaceae family. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Pithocarpa is typically found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun and showing drought tolerance."
