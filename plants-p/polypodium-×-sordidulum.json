    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 sordidulum, commonly known as the sordid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polypodium vulgare and Polypodium polystichoides. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically darker in color than those of its parent species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
