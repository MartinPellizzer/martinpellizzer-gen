    "intro": "Pterospartum tridentatum subsp. rhipheum, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and rocky soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
