    "intro": "Pilea pumila, commonly known as the baby rubber plant, is a small, compact perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of thick, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light. Pilea pumila is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to add a touch of greenery to any space."
