    "intro": "Psydrax parviflorus subsp. chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's narrow-leaved psyllium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems with hairy surfaces and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-containing capsules. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of mucilage, similar to other psyllium species."
