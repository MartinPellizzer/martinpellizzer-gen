    "intro": "Psilocarya corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered psychedelic mushroom, is a species of fungi characterized by its distinctive cap shape and vibrant coloration. It belongs to the family Psilocybiaceae and is known for containing psilocybin and psilocin, psychoactive compounds that induce altered states of consciousness. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters, hence its common name, and thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it grows on decaying wood. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is often sought after for both recreational and research purposes."
