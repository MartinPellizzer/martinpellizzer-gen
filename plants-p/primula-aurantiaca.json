    "intro": "Primula aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems covered in velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of orange and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
