    "intro": "Psychotria, commonly known as the \"devil's breath,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family, comprising over 200 species. These plants are predominantly found in tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Many species of Psychotria are characterized by their strikingly colored flowers, often with vivid red, orange, or yellow hues. Some species contain psychoactive alkaloids, such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which have been used in traditional rituals. The genus is also notable for its diverse ecological roles, including interactions with specific pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi."
