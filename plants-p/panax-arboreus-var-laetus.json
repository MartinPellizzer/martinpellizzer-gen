    "intro": "Panax arboreus var. laetus, commonly known as the Hawaiian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
