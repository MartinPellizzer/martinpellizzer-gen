    "intro": "Platystele steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with white petals and a greenish-yellow lip, which are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
