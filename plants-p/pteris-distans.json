    "intro": "Pteris distans, commonly known as the distant maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris distans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
