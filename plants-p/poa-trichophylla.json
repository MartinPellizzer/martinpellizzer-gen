    "intro": "Poa trichophylla, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are covered with fine hairs, giving it a silky texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa trichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
