    "intro": "Psychanthus scyphonemus, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that form a lush, crown-like appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically bright green with a slight golden sheen, especially under direct light. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds, which is typical of its fern classification. Psychanthus scyphonemus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
