It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white florets surrounded by a ring of bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and ornamental use. Pyrethrum brachanthemoides is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
