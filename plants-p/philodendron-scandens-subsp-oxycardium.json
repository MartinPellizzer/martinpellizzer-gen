    "intro": "Philodendron scandens subsp. oxycardium, commonly known as the heartleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
