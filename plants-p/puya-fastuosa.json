    "intro": "Puya fastuosa, commonly known as the Andean torch or royal torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya fastuosa produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
