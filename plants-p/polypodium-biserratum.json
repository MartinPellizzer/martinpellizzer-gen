    "intro": "Polypodium biserratum, commonly known as the two-toothed huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often divided into two distinct regions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium biserratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
