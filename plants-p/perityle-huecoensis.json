    "intro": "Perityle huecoensis, commonly known as the Huicoche\u00f1o perityle, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
