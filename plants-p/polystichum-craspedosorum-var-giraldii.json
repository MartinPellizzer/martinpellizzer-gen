    "intro": "Polystichum craspedosorum var. giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldii shield fern, is a variant of the broadshield fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
