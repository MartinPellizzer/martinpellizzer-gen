It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. This variety is closely related to other Primula species and exhibits characteristics typical of the genus, such as tuberous roots and showy inflorescences."
