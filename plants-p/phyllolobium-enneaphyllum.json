    "intro": "Phyllolobium enneaphyllum, commonly known as the nine-leaf phyllolobium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring nine leaflets arranged symmetrically along the petiole. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to nutrient-poor soils through its deep root system. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying shades of white or pale yellow, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
