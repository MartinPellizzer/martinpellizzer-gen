    "intro": "Prismatomeris connata, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
