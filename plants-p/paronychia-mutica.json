    "intro": "Paronychia mutica, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often sticky to the touch due to the presence of a waxy, resinous coating. Paronychia mutica is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils."
