    "intro": "Portulaca yecorensis, commonly known as Yecora pricklypear, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Portulaca yecorensis is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
