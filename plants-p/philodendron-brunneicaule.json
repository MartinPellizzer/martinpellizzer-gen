It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a reddish-brown stem that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique stem coloration makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and foliage enthusiasts."
