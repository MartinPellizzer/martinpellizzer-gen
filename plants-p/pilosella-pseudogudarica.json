It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella pseudogudarica is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
