    "intro": "Polylepis besseri, commonly known as the Andean waxtree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Peru and Bolivia. This tree is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Polylepis besseri is considered an endangered species."
