    "intro": "Pinus rumeliana, commonly known as the Rumelian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 cm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The Rumelian pine is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
