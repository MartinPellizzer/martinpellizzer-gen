    "intro": "Pyrethrum niveum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves. Pyrethrum niveum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its insecticidal properties, which are more commonly associated with other pyrethrum species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
