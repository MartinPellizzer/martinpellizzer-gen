    "intro": "Plagiogyria media, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, forming dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance."
