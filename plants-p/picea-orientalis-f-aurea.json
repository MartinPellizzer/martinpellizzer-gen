    "intro": "Picea orientalis f. aurea, commonly known as the golden fir, is a variant of the oriental spruce, characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage. This unique coloration is due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in its needles. The plant is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and botanical gardens."
