    "intro": "Pteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. Pteris orientalis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
