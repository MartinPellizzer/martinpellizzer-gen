    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. nitida, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, short, needle-like leaves that are typically white to pale blue in color due to a waxy coating. The cones of this variety are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
