    "intro": "Pilosocereus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran cactus, is a species native to El Salvador. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and sparse, pale green or white spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to the dry climate of its native region. It produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
