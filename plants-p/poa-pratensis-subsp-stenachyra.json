    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. stenachyra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green in color. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which contain the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
