    "intro": "Pernettya albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. Pernettya albiflora thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and pine forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
