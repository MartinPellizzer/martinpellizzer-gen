    "intro": "Potentilla acaulis, commonly known as the cushion potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
