    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. sessilis, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, glossy leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
