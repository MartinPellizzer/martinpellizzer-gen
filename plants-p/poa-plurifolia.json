    "intro": "Poa plurifolia, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Poa plurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
