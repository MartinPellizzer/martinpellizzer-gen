    "intro": "Poa polynoda var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
