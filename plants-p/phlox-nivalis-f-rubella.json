    "intro": "Phlox nivalis f. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered form of the snow phlox, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features dense clusters of showy, red-pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and attractive choice for gardeners seeking early-season color."
