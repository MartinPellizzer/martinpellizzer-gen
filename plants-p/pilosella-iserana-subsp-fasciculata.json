    "intro": "Pilosella iserana subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Pilosella iserana subsp. fasciculata is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
