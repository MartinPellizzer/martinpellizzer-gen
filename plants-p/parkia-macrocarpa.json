    "intro": "Parkia macrocarpa, commonly known as the African mahogany or yellow bell, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of multiple pairs of small leaflets. The tree produces distinctive yellow-orange flowers that are borne in drooping clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. The plant also plays a role in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
