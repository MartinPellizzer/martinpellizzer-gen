    "intro": "Pachyloma arvense, commonly known as the field pachyloma, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Pachyloma arvense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
