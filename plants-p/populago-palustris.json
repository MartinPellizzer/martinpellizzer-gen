    "intro": "Populago palustris, commonly known as the marsh poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks, swamps, and other wet habitats. Populago palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
