It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a dark green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
