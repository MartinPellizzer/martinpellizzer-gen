    "intro": "Pinus sapo, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Pinus sapo plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
