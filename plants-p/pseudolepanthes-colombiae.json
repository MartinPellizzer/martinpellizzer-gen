    "intro": "Pseudolepanthes colombiae, commonly known as the Colombian ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
