    "intro": "Pteris \u00d7 calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea fern, is a hybrid species within the water fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris \u00d7 calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in humid conditions."
