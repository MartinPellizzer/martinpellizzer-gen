    "intro": "Plantago alismatifolia, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments. It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other water-saturated areas."
