    "intro": "Psychopsiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Psychopsiella thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
