    "intro": "Pyrus sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble those of the sorbus genus, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth bark and a preference for well-drained soils in temperate climates. Pyrus sorbifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
