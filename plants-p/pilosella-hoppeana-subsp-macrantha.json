    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the showy pearly everlet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow pappus that gives it a fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, often forming compact, mat-like growths. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger flower heads compared to other Pilosella species."
