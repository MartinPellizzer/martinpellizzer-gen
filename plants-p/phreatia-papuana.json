    "intro": "Phreatia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Papua and surrounding areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. The plant produces striking, pale green to white flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
