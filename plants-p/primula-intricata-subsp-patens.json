    "intro": "Primula intricata subsp. patens, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a compact rosette of ovate, hairy leaves that are arranged in a tight cluster near the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of alpine plants."
