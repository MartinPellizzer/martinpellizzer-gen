    "intro": "Pyrrosia serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Pyrrosia serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
