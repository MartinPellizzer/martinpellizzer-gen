    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum szowitzii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually narrow and opposite. It is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
