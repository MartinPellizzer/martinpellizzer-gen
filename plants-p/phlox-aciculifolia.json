    "intro": "Phlox aciculifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Phlox aciculifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
