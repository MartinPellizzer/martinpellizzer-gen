    "intro": "Polycodium lautum, commonly known as the water polycodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, sometimes waterlogged soils. Polycodium lautum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
