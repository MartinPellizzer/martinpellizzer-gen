    "intro": "Pentacyphus lehmannii subsp. tamanus, commonly known as the Tamanus cypress, is a rare coniferous species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scaly, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
