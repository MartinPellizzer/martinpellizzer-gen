    "intro": "Polypodium polypodioides var. microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bright green color and a waxy texture. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more refined leaves compared to the typical form of Polypodium polypodioides."
