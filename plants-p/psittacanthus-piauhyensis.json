    "intro": "Psittacanthus piauhyensis, commonly known as the Piauhy palm, is a species of cycad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
