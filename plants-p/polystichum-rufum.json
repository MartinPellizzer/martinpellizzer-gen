    "intro": "Polystichum rufum, commonly known as the rusty holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a reddish-brown margin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color. Polystichum rufum is a hardy perennial that thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
