    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. laeve, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Timothy grass is valued for its forage quality and has been historically used in agricultural settings."
