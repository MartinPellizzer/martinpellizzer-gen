    "intro": "Polypodium leucolepis, commonly known as the silver-veined cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a pale, silvery appearance on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique, linear pattern. Polypodium leucolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
