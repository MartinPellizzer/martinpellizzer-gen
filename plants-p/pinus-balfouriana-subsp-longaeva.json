    "intro": "Pinus balfouriana subsp. longaeva, commonly known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine, is a subspecies of the whitebark pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slow growth, longevity, and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species. Its cones are woody and contain small, winged seeds. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
