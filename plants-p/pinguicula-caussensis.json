    "intro": "Pinguicula caussensis, commonly known as the Caussens butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
