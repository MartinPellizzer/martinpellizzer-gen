    "intro": "Pinus monophylla var. edulis, commonly known as the edible pine or the desert pine, is a variant of the single-leaf pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and cone-bearing structure, which are typical features of the Pinaceae family. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance and efficient water conservation mechanisms. Its cones produce edible seeds, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples as a food source. The tree's ecological role includes providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
