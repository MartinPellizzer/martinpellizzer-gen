    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. apennina, commonly known as the Mediterranean plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its broad, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a hardy perennial that is often found along shorelines and in sandy soils. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and is an important species in coastal vegetation."
