    "intro": "Primula intrusa, commonly known as the intruding primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a fine, downy texture. Primula intrusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
