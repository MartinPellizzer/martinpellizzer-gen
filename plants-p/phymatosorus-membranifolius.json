    "intro": "Phymatosorus membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
