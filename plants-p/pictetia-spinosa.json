    "intro": "Pictetia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny pictetia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Pictetia spinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
