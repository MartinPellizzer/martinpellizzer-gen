    "intro": "Pinus banksiana, commonly known as the white pine or stone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Pinus banksiana is also notable for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession."
