    "intro": "Persica vulgaris succosa, commonly known as the succulent peach. This plant is a variant of the peach tree adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its flowers are typically pink or white, similar to those of the common peach, but it produces smaller, more drought-resistant fruits. The plant has a woody stem with a succulent texture, allowing it to survive in dry climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
