    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum f. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed four-leaf morning glory, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the four-leaf morning glory. It is characterized by its reduced foliage and slender, often sparsely branched stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its flowers are usually small, pale blue or white, and bloom in the early morning. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant variation and adaptation."
