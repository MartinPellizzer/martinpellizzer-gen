    "intro": "Plantago uliginosa var. winteri, commonly known as the winter plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of North America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other Plantago species, adapting to colder climates."
