    "intro": "Phyllanthus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas within the subtropical climate of its native habitat. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
