It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
