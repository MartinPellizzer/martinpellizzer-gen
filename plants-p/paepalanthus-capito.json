    "intro": "Paepalanthus capito, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
