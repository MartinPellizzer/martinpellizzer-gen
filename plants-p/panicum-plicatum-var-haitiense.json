    "intro": "Panicum plicatum var. haitiense, commonly known as Haitian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
