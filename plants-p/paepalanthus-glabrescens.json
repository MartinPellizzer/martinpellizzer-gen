It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are often showy and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
