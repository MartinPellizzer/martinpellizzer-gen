It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Potamogeton latior plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
