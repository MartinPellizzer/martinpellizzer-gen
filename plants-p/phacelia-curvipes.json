    "intro": "Phacelia curvipes, commonly known as the bentstem phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often curling stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Phacelia curvipes plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
