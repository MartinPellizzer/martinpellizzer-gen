    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus var. zabeliana, commonly known as the Zabel's cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It features glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and year-round beauty. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care must be taken when handling or planting it."
