    "intro": "Panicularia borealis, commonly known as the northern panicled grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, panicled inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Panicularia borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an indicator species for tundra and alpine ecosystems."
