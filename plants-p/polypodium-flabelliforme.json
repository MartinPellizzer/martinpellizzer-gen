    "intro": "Polypodium flabelliforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium flabelliforme is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
