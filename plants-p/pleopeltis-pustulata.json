    "intro": "Pleopeltis pustulata, commonly known as the pustulate rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and distinctive, pustulate (bumpy) texture on its fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis pustulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
