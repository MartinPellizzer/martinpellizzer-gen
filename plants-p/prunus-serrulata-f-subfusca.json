It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are dark green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in horticultural settings."
