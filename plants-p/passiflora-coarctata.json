It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with prominent filaments and a crown of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. Passiflora coarctata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological value to pollinators."
