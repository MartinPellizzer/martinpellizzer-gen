    "intro": "Periestes baronii, commonly known as the Baron's peristyle, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
