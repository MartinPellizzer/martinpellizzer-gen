    "intro": "Payena polyandra, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
