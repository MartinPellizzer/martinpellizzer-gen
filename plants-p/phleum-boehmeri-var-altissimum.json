    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. altissimum, commonly known as tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
