    "intro": "Pseudosericocoma pungens, commonly known as the spiny lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a foliose lichen characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is usually covered with small, rounded lobes and is often a pale green or yellowish color. The lower surface contains the symbiotic cyanobacteria and algae that provide nutrients through photosynthesis. This lichen is typically found on rocks and soil in arid or semi-arid environments."
