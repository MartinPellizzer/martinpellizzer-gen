    "intro": "Poterium polygamum f. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly-fruited potterscale, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It is typically found in rocky or dry habitats, often in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
