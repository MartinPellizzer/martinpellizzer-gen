    "intro": "Polypodium curranii, commonly known as the Curran's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows on trees and rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive, leathery frond with a broad, shield-shaped outline, and its rhizomes are thick and creeping. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
