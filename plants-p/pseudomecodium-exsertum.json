    "intro": "Pseudomecodium exsertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pseudomecodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with prominent, showy bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
