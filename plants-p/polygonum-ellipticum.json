It typically grows in moist habitats such as wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed soils. The plant features alternate, elliptic-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in late summer to early fall. Polygonum ellipticum is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
