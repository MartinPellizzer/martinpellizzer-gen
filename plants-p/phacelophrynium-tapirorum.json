    "intro": "Phacelophrynium tapirorum, commonly known as the tapir's tongue plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces striking inflorescences with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which attract pollinators such as insects and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
