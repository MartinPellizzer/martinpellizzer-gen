    "intro": "Persicaria viscofera, commonly known as sticky willow or woolly smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Persicaria viscofera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
