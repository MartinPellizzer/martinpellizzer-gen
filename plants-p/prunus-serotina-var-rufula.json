    "intro": "Prunus serotina var. rufula, commonly known as the rough-chinned black cherry, is a variant of the black cherry tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are important for wildlife. Its growth habit is typically as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in moist, wooded areas. The leaves and fruits have been used historically by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and culinary purposes."
