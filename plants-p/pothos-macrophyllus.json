    "intro": "Pothos macrophyllus, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more renowned for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
