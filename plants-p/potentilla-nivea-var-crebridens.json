    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. crebridens, commonly known as the snow willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, grayish stems covered in soft, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky environments."
