    "intro": "Podocarpus novae-caledoniae var. colliculatus, commonly known as the New Caledonia mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that mature to release winged seeds. The plant thrives in humid, mountainous environments with well-drained soil, often growing at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast in its native habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, supporting a range of endemic insect and bird species."
