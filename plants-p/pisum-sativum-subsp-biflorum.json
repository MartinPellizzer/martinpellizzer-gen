    "intro": "Pisum sativum subsp. biflorum, commonly known as the twin-flowered pea, is a subspecies of the pea plant characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescences. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to its cultivated relative, the common garden pea. Its foliage is typically trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it exhibits a climbing habit through tendrils. This subspecies is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique floral structure and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
