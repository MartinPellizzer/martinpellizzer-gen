It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Plectranthus nitidus is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in herbal teas or as a fragrant ornamental plant."
