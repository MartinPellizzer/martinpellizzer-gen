    "intro": "Polygonum barbatum var. stagninum, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and lack showy petals, relying on wind for pollination. This species is often found in shallow water or saturated ground, contributing to the ecological dynamics of wetland ecosystems."
