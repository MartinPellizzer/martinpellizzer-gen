    "intro": "Prasophyllum parvicallum, commonly known as the small-horned leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, featuring a single, tuberous rhizome and a cluster of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are often inconspicuous and lack the showy petals typical of many orchids. It is typically found in heathlands and open forests, growing in well-drained soils. Prasophyllum parvicallum is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
