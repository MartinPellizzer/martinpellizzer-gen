    "intro": "Pongamia piscatoria, commonly known as the Indian beech or fish tree, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 11 to 21 leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Pongamia piscatoria is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
