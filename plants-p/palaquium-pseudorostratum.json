    "intro": "Palaquium pseudorostratum, commonly known as the yellow mangostin, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits with a thick, acidic rind. The fruit's interior contains segments filled with a sweet, white pulp, making it a popular fruit in local markets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
