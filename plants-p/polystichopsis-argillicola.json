    "intro": "Polystichopsis argillicola, commonly known as the clay fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and finely divided, forming a dense, mat-like structure. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed, ancient ecosystems."
