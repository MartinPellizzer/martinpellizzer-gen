    "intro": "Polypodium cambricum f. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated rock fern, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or wooded areas. Its fronds are evergreen, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
