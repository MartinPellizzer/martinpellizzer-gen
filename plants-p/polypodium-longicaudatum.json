    "intro": "Polypodium longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that can reach several feet in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that helps it anchor to trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, narrow segments that contribute to its lush, feathery look. Polypodium longicaudatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
