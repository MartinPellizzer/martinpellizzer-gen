    "intro": "Polymnia uribea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark and wood have been traditionally used for their aromatic properties and in various medicinal applications. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
