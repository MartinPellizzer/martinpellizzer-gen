    "intro": "Pterophacos tetrapterus, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a unique member of the family Pterophacaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically small and delicate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests."
