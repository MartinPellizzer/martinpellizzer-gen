    "intro": "Polygala arillata var. revoluta, commonly known as the curled-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its unique, rolled or curled leaf margins, which give it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks."
