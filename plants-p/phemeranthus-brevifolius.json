    "intro": "Phemeranthus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom briefly. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are short and narrow, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is often found in disturbed or open habitats where it can complete its life cycle quickly."
