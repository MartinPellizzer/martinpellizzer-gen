    "intro": "Phyllanthus fluitans, commonly known as floating nectarine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in wet or aquatic environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its floating leaves, which are broad and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Phyllanthus fluitans is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a useful plant in certain ecological contexts and a potential weed."
