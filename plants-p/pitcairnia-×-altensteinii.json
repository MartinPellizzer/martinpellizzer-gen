    "intro": "Pitcairnia \u00d7 altensteinii, commonly known as the Altenstein's pitcairnia, is a hybrid bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also considered endangered in the wild."
