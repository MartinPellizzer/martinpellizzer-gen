    "intro": "Phebalium deserti, commonly known as the desert phebalium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native garden designs."
