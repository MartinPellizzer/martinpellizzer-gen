    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a conical shape with a broad, rounded crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are flat and dark green, with a waxy coating, and it produces distinctive cones that hang downward. Its bark is thick, scaly, and reddish-brown, providing protection against forest fires. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
