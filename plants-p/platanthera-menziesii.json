    "intro": "Platanthera menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence of pale pink or white flowers arranged in a loose, spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Platanthera menziesii is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements."
