It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and produces fruiting structures called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
