    "intro": "Poa flexuosa var. contracta, commonly known as the curled bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its compact form and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
