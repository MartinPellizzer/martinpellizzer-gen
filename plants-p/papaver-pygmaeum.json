    "intro": "Papaver pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf poppy, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a red or purple blotch at the base. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
