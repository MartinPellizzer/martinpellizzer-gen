    "intro": "Piper elbancoanum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy pepper plant, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is often used in herbal remedies due to its pungent and stimulating properties. The varietal name 'tomentosum' refers to the dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which is a distinguishing botanical feature."
