It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and a distinctive greenish-brown flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. This variety is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid features such as specialized roots and a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi."
