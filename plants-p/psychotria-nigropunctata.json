    "intro": "Psychotria nigropunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with small black dots, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Psychotria nigropunctata is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
