It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer.
