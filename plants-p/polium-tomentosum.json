    "intro": "Polium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly polium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Polium tomentosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
