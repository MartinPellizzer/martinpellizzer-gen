It features glossy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of green or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive foliage make it a desirable addition to shaded or low-light environments."
