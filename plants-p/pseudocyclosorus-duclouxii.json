    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper portion of the stem and produce spores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
