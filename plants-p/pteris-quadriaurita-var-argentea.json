It is characterized by its distinctive, bright silver-white fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green veins. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
