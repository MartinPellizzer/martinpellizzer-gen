    "intro": "Puya quetameensis, commonly known as the Quetameensis Puya, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with ample sunlight. Its leaves form a rosette structure, which helps collect and retain water in its arid habitat. Puya quetameensis is also noted for its slow growth and long flowering period, making it a unique and valuable species in botanical studies."
