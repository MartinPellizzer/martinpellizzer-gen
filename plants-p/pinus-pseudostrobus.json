    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. The species is valued for its timber and has ecological significance in its native habitats."
