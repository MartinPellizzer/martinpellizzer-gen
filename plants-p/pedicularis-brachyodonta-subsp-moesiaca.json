    "intro": "Pedicularis brachyodonta subsp. moesiaca, commonly known as the Balkan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
