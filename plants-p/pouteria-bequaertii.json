    "intro": "Pouteria bequaertii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, spreading canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by large, round fruits containing a single, hard-shelled seed, which is the source of the highly prized Brazil nut. Pouteria bequaertii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its importance in traditional and commercial contexts."
