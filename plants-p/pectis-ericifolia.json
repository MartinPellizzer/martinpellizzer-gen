    "intro": "Pectis ericifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is shrub-like, with narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pectis ericifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation."
