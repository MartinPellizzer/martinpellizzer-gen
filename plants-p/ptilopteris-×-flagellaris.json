    "intro": "Ptilopteris \u00d7 flagellaris, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile fern that results from the cross between Ptilopteris mucronata and Ptilopteris leucopoda. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms. The hybrid is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
