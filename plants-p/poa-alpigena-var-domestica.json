    "intro": "Poa alpigena var. domestica, commonly known as the alpine grass or domestic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with fine, blue-green foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and resilience in challenging climates."
