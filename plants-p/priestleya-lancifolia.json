    "intro": "Priestleya lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it relies on its extensive root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Priestleya lancifolia is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable plant for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
