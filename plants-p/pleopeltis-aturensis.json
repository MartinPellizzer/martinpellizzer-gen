    "intro": "Pleopeltis aturensis, commonly known as the Atures fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth margin and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
