    "intro": "Pieris mairei var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are smaller and more oval in shape compared to other pieris varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and ability to provide year-round interest."
