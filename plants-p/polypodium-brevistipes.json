    "intro": "Polypodium brevistipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium brevistipes is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soil."
