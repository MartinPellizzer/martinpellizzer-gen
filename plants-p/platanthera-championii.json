    "intro": "Platanthera championii, commonly known as the Champion's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a distinctive, fragrant floral arrangement that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. It blooms in late summer, producing small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose, spiraling pattern. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
