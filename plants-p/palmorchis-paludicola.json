    "intro": "Palmorchis paludicola, commonly known as the marsh palm orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its unique morphology allows it to adapt to the challenging conditions of its wetland environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
