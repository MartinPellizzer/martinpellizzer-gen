    "intro": "Puya heterophylla, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya heterophylla is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a unique and striking addition to botanical gardens."
