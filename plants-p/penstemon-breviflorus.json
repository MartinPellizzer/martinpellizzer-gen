    "intro": "Penstemon breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Penstemon breviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
