    "intro": "Piranhea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican piranha plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
