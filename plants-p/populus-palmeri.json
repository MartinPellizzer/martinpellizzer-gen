    "intro": "Populus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Populus palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in riparian zones."
