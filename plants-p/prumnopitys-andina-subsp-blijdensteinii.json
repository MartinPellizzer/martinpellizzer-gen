    "intro": "Prumnopitys andina subsp. blijdensteinii, commonly known as the Andean white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous climates. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
