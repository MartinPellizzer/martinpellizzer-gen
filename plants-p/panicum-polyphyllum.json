    "intro": "Panicum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are distinctive and often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest. Panicum polyphyllum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
