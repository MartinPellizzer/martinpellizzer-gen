    "intro": "Phegopteris crinalis var. tripinnata, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Phegopteris. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow in the dark. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its fronds are typically tripinnate, meaning they have three levels of branching, giving it a feathery appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens."
