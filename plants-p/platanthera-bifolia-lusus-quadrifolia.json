    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia lusus quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a distinctive floral arrangement of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its name reflects both its floral structure and its occasional occurrence with four leaves, a rare trait in the species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
