    "intro": "Polypodium pachycaulum, commonly known as the thick-veined wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest environments, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The thick, fleshy leaves help the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
