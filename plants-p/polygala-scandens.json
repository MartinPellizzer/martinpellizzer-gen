    "intro": "Polygala scandens, commonly known as the climbing milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often twine around other plants or structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, featuring a unique structure with a spurred lower petal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Polygala scandens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
