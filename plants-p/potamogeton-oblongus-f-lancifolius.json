    "intro": "Potamogeton oblongus f. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Potamogeton oblongus."
