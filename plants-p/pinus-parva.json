    "intro": "Pinus parva, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States. It typically grows to a height of only 1 to 3 meters, with a compact, rounded form that allows it to thrive in harsh alpine environments. The tree has slender, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky soils where other plants struggle to grow."
