    "intro": "Polygonum lanceifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Polygonum lanceifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
