    "intro": "Persea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, orange to reddish fruits that are edible when fully mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
