    "intro": "Prasophyllum innubum, commonly known as the black leek orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Prasophyllum innubum is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
