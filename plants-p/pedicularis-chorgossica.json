    "intro": "Pedicularis chorgossica, commonly known as the Chorgos lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it derives nutrients from its host plants. It produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
