    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. kefaliana, commonly known as the Kefalonia cherry, is a lesser-known variant of the blackthorn plant native to the island of Kefalonia in Greece. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer, and its thorny, deciduous shrub form. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces small white flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, making it a unique botanical specimen in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species of interest to botanists and conservationists."
