    "intro": "Polypodium dielsianum, commonly known as the Diels' shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal practices."
