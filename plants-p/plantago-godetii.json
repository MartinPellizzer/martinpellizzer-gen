    "intro": "Plantago godetii, commonly known as Godet's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
