    "intro": "Pleiotaxis arenaria, commonly known as the sand-plain pleiotaxis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to thrive in disturbed or open habitats, making it a characteristic component of certain dry ecosystems."
