    "intro": "Polygonifolia propinqua, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the humid understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble a feather. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires consistent humidity to prevent desiccation. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
