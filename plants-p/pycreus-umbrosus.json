    "intro": "Pycreus umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pycreus umbrosus is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, moist woodland environments."
