    "intro": "Physaria reediana var. spatulata, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features fleshy, broadly ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more spatulate leaves compared to other Physaria species."
