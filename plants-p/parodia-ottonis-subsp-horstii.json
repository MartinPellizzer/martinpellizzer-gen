    "intro": "Parodia ottonis subsp. horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its blue-green stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
