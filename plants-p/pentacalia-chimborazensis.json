    "intro": "Pentacalia chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
