    "intro": "Primula villosa subsp. infecta, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence and slightly different floral morphology compared to other Primula species."
