    "intro": "Puffia, commonly known as the \"puffball mushroom,\" is a type of fungi, not a plant, and therefore does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. It belongs to the family Agaricaceae and is characterized by its round, dense, spore-filled fruiting body. Unlike plants, puffia lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It reproduces through spores released from the surface of its mature fruiting body. Puffia is often found in grassy areas and can be mistaken for edible mushrooms, though some species are toxic."
