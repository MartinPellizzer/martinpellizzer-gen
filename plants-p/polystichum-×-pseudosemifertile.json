    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 pseudosemifertile, commonly known as the hybrid deer fern, is a sterile or nearly sterile fern resulting from the crossbreeding of two species within the Polystichum genus. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable spores, relying instead on vegetative propagation for survival. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
