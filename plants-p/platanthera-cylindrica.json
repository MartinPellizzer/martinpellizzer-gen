    "intro": "Platanthera cylindrica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is a non-photosynthetic plant, meaning it derives its nutrients from the fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
