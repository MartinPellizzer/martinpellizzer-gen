    "intro": "Phlegmariurus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Phlegmariurus rufescens reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
