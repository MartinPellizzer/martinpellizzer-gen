    "intro": "Petrosedum \u00d7 pascalianum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white to silver hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to care for and can withstand drought conditions."
