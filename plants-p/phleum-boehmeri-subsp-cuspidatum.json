    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri subsp. cuspidatum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, bearing small, two-ranked flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable forage plant and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
