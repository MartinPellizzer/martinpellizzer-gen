    "intro": "Phegopteris krameri, commonly known as the Krameri's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Phegopteris krameri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
