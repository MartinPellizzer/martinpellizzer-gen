    "intro": "Pilocereus lanatus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cacti native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night before wilting."
