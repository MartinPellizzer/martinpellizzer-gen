    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium viscosum, commonly known as sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically hairy and covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Pseudognaphalium viscosum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and prairies."
