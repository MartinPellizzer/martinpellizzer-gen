    "intro": "Prunus pumila subsp. besseyi, commonly known as the Bessey dwarf cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
