    "intro": "Platylepis goodyeroides, commonly known as the Goodyera-like platylepis, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth margin, and the plant is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices."
