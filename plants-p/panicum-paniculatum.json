    "intro": "Panicum paniculatum, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that resemble bottle brushes. The plant produces pink to red bracts that give it its distinctive appearance, and it blooms from late spring to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique foliage and vibrant flowering make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
