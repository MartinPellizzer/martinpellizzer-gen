    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. eucerasifera, commonly known as the European cherry or Prunus eucerasifera, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cherry species."
