    "intro": "Phlebocarya pilosissima subsp. teretifolia, commonly known as the hairy phlebocarya, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structures. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The subspecies teretifolia is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and are often white or pale green in color. This plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in temperate regions, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
