    "intro": "Potentilla canescens humilis, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
