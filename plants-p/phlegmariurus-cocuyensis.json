    "intro": "Phlegmariurus cocuyensis, commonly known as the Cocuy mountain liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a flattened thallus and small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It plays an important ecological role in tropical and subtropical ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
