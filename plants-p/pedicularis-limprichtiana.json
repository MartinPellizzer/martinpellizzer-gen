    "intro": "Pedicularis limprichtiana, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 400 species of flowering plants, many of which are found in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of alpine flora and pollination ecology."
