    "intro": "Pulegium cervinum, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spikes. The plant is characterized by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is attributed to its essential oils. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. Pulegium cervinum is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and respiratory benefits."
