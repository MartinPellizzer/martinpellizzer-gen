    "intro": "Pulsatilla bungeana var. astragalifolia, commonly known as the Astragalifolia Pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a spherical, spiky fruit known as a follicle, which contains several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
