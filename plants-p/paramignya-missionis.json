    "intro": "Paramignya missionis, commonly known as the Mission's paramignya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
