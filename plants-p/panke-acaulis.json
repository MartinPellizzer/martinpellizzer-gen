    "intro": "Panke acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a single yellow flower with ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant."
