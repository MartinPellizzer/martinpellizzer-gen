It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
