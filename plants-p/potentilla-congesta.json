    "intro": "Potentilla congesta, commonly known as the clustered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Potentilla congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
