    "intro": "Penstemon depressus, commonly known as the low penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, tubular flowers range in color from blue to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Penstemon depressus is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
