    "intro": "Palicourea phaneroneura, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them."
