    "intro": "Peloria, commonly known as the \"flowering plant with double flowers,\" is a botanical term referring to a type of flower that exhibits a double or clustered bloom. It is most commonly associated with the genus Ranunculus, where it results from a genetic mutation that causes the plant to produce multiple petals instead of the usual single flower. This phenomenon is also observed in other plants such as roses and hawthorns, where it is often a result of hybridization or natural variation. The peloria effect can create visually striking floral displays, making these plants popular in horticulture. Botanically, it is a fascinating example of morphological variation and genetic diversity in flowering plants."
