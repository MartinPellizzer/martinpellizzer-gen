    "intro": "Polypodium sarmentosum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along tree trunks and branches. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape and serrated edges. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in humid environments. Polypodium sarmentosum is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices."
