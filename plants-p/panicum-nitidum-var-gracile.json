It features fine, hair-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, giving it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant produces delicate, fluffy panicles that are typically pink to reddish in hue, adding visual interest. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its small size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
