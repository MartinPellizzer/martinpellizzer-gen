    "intro": "Polypodium oblongisorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid environments."
