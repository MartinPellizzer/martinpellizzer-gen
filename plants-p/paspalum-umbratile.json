    "intro": "Paspalum umbratile, commonly known as the shade paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
