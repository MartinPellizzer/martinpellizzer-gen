    "intro": "Psittacanthus rugostylus, commonly known as the rough-styled staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant's fronds are typically divided into finger-like segments, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
