    "intro": "Piqueria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered piqueria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Piqueria triflora is often found in desert scrub habitats and is considered a rare species in some areas."
