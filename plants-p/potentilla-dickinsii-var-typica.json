It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has palmate leaves divided into five lobes, which are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
