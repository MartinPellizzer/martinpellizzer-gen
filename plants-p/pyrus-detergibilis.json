    "intro": "Pyrus detergibilis, commonly known as the cleansing pear, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, green leaves and white flowers in early spring. The plant's fruit, which resembles a pear, is known for its mild detergent properties due to the presence of saponins. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold climate to complete its annual growth cycle. Due to its limited distribution and unique chemical composition, it is of interest to botanists and researchers."
