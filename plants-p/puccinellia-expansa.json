    "intro": "Puccinellia expansa, commonly known as saltbush or alkali grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and inland saline soils, thriving in conditions where other plants struggle. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is well adapted to high salinity and drought, making it an important component of saline ecosystems. Puccinellia expansa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
