    "intro": "Pycreus latovaginatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pycreus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Pycreus latovaginatus is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
