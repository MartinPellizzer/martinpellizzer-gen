    "intro": "Philodendron ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its stems are sturdy and can climb using aerial roots, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. Philodendron ligulatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush foliage."
