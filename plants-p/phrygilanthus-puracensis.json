    "intro": "Phrygilanthus puracensis, commonly known as the Peruvian flame tree, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a vibrant display during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a dense canopy of dark green, glossy leaves. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Phrygilanthus puracensis is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
