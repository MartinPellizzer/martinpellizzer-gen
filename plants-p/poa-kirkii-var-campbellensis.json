    "intro": "Poa kirkii var. campbellensis, commonly known as Campbell's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
