    "intro": "Polypodium brongniartii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in P. brongniartii."
