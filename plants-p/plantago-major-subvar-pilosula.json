    "intro": "Plantago major subvar. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, along roadsides, and in urban environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. The subvariety pilosula is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other varieties of Plantago major."
