It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, cup-shaped bracts that enclose its flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
