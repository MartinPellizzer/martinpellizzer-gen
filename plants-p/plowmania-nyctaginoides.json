    "intro": "Plowmania nyctaginoides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
