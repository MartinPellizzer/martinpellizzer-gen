    "intro": "Plantago ovina, commonly known as sheep's bread, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are hairy and grayish in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in a variety of environments, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. Botanically, it is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits."
