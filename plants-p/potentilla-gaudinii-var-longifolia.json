    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
