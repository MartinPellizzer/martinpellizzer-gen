    "intro": "Parinari chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan parinari, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and foothill regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
