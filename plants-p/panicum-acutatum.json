    "intro": "Panicum acutatum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, stiff leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous slender, bristle-tipped flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Panicum acutatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
