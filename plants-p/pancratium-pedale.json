    "intro": "Pancratium pedale, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a striking flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red-orange center. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pancratium pedale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
