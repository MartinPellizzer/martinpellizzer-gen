    "intro": "Polystichum muticum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Polystichum muticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
