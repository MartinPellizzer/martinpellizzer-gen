    "intro": "Persea gratissima var. praecox, commonly known as the early-ripening avocado, is a variant of the avocado tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. The fruit matures earlier than the standard variety, making it a preferred choice for commercial cultivation. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and the avocado industry."
