    "intro": "Parkinsonia inermis, commonly known as the velvet bean tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and use in traditional medicine."
