    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Pseudolysimachion maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its role in stabilizing coastal soils."
