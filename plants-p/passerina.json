    "intro": "Passerina, commonly known as the small white orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. Passerina species are typically herbaceous perennials with delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and they often grow in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are characterized by their small size, white or pale pink coloration, and a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species."
