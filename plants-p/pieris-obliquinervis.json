    "intro": "Pieris obliquinervis, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent veins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, adding visual interest to gardens in both seasons."
