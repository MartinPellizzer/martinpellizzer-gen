It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are often pale green or white, contributing to its subtle aesthetic appeal."
