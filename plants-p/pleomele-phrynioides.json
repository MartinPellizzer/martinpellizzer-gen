    "intro": "Pleomele phrynioides, commonly known as the giant pleomele, is a striking member of the Dracaena family (Dracaenaceae). It is native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and broad, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
