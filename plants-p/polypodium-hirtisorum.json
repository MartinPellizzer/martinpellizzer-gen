    "intro": "Polypodium hirtisorum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a broad, shield-shaped appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
