It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
