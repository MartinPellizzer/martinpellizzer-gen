It is characterized by its tufted clumps of slender, arching leaves that form a fountain-like shape. The plant produces fluffy, white or pale pink plumes during the summer months, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental grass in gardens. Pennisetum antillarum is drought-tolerant and adaptable to various climates, contributing to its widespread cultivation."
