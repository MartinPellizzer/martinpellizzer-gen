    "intro": "Peucedanum petteri, commonly known as the Tibetan cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its habitat, it is relatively rare and has limited distribution."
