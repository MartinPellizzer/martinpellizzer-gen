    "intro": "Polypodium lasiosorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium lasiosorum is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in montane habitats."
