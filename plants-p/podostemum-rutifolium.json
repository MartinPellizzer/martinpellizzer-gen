    "intro": "Podostemum rutifolium, commonly known as the river hibiscus, is a unique aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in fast-flowing streams and rivers, anchoring itself to rocks with its specialized root system. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that help reduce water resistance, allowing it to thrive in strong currents. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or white, with five petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Podostemum rutifolium plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic life."
