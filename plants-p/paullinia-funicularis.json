    "intro": "Paullinia funicularis, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or the Brazilian guan\u00e1bana, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is typically smaller and less widely cultivated. Its botanical features include a woody stem, palmate leaves, and a fruit with a thick, spiny rind. The plant is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
