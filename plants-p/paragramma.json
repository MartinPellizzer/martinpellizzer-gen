    "intro": "Paragramma, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that often float on the water's surface or hang from submerged stems. Paragramma species typically thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where they contribute to aquatic ecosystems. Their rhizomes are often anchored to substrates, allowing them to spread vegetatively. The plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the water makes it an important component of wetland habitats."
