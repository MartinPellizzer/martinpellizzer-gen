    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. diffusa, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features wiry, silver-gray stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its characteristic silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface and a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
