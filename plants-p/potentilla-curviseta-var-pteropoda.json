    "intro": "Potentilla curviseta var. pteropoda, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
