    "intro": "Pennisetum occidentale, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, lavender-pink flower spikes that rise above narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is narrow and upright, with a fountain-like growth habit that adds visual interest to gardens. Pennisetum occidentale is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
