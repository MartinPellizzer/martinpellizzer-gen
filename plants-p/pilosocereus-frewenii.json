    "intro": "Pilosocereus frewenii, commonly known as the Freewen's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its roots are shallow, enabling it to absorb moisture from the surface quickly after rain. Pilosocereus frewenii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
