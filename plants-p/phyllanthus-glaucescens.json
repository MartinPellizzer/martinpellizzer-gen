    "intro": "Phyllanthus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glaucous, meaning they have a whitish or bluish waxy coating. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by tiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
