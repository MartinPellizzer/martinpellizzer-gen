    "intro": "Phaca depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its simple, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and has a relatively short flowering period. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
