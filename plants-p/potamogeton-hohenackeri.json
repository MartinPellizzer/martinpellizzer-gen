It typically grows in freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its ecological significance, it is often monitored as an indicator of water quality."
