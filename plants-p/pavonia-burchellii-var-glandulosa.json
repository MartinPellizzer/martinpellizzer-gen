    "intro": "Pavonia burchellii var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pavonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
