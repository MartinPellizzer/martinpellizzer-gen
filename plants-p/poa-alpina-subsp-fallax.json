It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a deep root system and a mat-forming growth habit. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
