    "intro": "Prunus avium f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the standard variety. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of Asia, including China and the Middle East. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common peach. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit. The narrow leaf structure makes it distinct and suitable for specific horticultural applications."
