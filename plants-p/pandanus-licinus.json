    "intro": "Pandanus licinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, three-lobed structure that contains seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
