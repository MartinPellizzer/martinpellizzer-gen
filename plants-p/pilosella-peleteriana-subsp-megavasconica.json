    "intro": "Pilosella peleteriana subsp. megavasconica, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow composite flowers. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
