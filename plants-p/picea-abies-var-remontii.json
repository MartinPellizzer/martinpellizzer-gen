    "intro": "Picea abies var. remontii, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a variant of the European spruce native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive bark that becomes flaky with age. This evergreen conifer thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation. The plant is valued for its timber and is also cultivated in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
