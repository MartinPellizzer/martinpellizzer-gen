It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Pseudolaelia pavopolitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific environmental requirements."
