    "intro": "Pycreus diaphanus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Pycreus diaphanus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
