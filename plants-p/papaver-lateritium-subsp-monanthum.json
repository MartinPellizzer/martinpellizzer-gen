    "intro": "Papaver lateritium subsp. monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered poppy, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short growth cycle and is often found in rocky or arid habitats, where it has adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are usually a deep red or orange color, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
