    "intro": "Peniophyllum, commonly known as the edible bracket fungus, is a type of polypore mushroom belonging to the family Trametes. It is characterized by its tough, woody texture and its ability to grow on dead wood, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. The fruiting body of Peniophyllum is typically flat or slightly curved, with a pale to dark brown cap that often has a velvety surface. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is valued for its nutritional content, including proteins and amino acids. However, it is important to correctly identify the species, as some Peniophyllum species can be toxic."
