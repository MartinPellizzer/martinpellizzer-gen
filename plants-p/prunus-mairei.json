    "intro": "Prunus mairei, commonly known as the Maire cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, red cherries that are popular in local cuisine. Prunus mairei thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance to M\u0101ori culture."
