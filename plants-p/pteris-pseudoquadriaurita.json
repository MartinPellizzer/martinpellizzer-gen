    "intro": "Pteris pseudoquadriaurita, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically covered in a thin, protective layer. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
