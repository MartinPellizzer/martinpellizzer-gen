    "intro": "Pycnosphaera gracilis, commonly known as the slender glassy cup, is a small, cup-shaped lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent thallus that often appears as a cup or shell. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae for photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its fragile structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
