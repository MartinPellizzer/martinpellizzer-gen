    "intro": "Pilosella clinans, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Pilosella clinans is often found in rocky soils and meadows, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions."
