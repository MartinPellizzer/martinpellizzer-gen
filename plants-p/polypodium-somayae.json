    "intro": "Polypodium somayae, commonly known as the Somayae fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium somayae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
