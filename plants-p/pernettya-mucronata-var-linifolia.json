    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. linifolia, commonly known as the slender cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
