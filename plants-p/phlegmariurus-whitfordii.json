    "intro": "Phlegmariurus whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit with simple, linear leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations. This species is characterized by its primitive morphology and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
