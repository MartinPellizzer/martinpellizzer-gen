    "intro": "Pultenaea villosa var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty pultenaea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive rust-colored foliage, which gives it its common name."
