    "intro": "Phoradendron acuminatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stem. The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food for birds and other wildlife."
