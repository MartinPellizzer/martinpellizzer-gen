    "intro": "Phegopteris macroptera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae that help in photosynthesis. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to various aquatic organisms."
