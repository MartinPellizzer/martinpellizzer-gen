It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, pale green to grayish-blue stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Parodia talaensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
