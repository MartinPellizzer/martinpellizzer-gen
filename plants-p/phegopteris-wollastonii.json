    "intro": "Phegopteris wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that may aid in attracting pollinators or deterring herbivores. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
