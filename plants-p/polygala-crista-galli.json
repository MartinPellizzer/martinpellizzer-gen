It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a unique, crested appearance that gives it its common name.
