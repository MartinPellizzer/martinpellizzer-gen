    "intro": "Pleurothallis nox-media, commonly known as the night-blooming pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white or pale-colored blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
