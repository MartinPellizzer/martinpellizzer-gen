    "intro": "Potentilla supina vulgaris, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas."
