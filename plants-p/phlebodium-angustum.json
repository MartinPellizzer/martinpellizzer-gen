    "intro": "Phlebodium angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to surfaces while absorbing moisture from the air. The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
