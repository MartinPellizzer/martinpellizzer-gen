    "intro": "Poa curvata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Poa curvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
