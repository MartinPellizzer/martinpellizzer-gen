    "intro": "Phyllostylon orthopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, ribbon-like leaves that help reduce water resistance. Its reproductive structures are typically small and inconspicuous, with flowers that are adapted for aquatic pollination. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey."
