    "intro": "Polypodium acutilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients, which contributes to its resilience in varying conditions. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making them visually distinctive."
