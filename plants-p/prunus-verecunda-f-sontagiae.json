    "intro": "Prunus verecunda f. sontagiae, commonly known as the Sonntag's cherry, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree with attractive, glossy dark green leaves and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
