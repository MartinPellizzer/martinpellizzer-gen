    "intro": "Potentilla buccoana, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Potentilla buccoana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal soils."
