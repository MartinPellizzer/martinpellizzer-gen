    "intro": "Polypodium wolfli, commonly known as the Wolfli's fern, is a species of polypodiaceae, a family of ferns. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled environments."
