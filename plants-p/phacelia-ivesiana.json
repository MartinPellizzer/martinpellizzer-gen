    "intro": "Phacelia ivesiana, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Phacelia ivesiana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
