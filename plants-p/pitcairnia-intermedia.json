    "intro": "Pitcairnia intermedia, commonly known as the silver leaf pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that encase small, white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia intermedia is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
