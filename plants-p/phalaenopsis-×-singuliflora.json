    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 singuliflora, commonly known as the singular-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Phalaenopsis and other orchid species. It is characterized by its unique, single bloom per stem, which sets it apart from the typical clustered flowers of most Phalaenopsis varieties. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months, contribute to its ornamental value."
