    "intro": "Potentilla simplex, commonly known as evergreen cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates."
