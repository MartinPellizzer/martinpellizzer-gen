    "intro": "Poa angustifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
