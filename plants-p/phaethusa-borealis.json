    "intro": "Phaethusa borealis, commonly known as the northern phaethusa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand freezing temperatures. Phaethusa borealis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food for local pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
