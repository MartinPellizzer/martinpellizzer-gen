    "intro": "Pseudobombax, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts are often mistaken for flowers and serve to attract pollinators. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and is known for its rapid growth and ornamental value. Pseudobombax species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous true flowers."
