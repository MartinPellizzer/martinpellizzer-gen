    "intro": "Pachypteris persica, commonly known as the Persian shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Native to regions of southern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
