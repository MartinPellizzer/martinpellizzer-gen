    "intro": "Photinia davidiana var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
