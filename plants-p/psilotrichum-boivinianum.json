    "intro": "Psilotrichum boivinianum, commonly known as the Boivin's spike moss, is a member of the family Psilotaceae, which includes primitive vascular plants. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots and relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Psilotrichum boivinianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
