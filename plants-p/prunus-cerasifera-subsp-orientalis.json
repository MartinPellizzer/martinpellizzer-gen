    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This subspecies is closely related to the common cherry but is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and unique floral and fruit characteristics."
