    "intro": "Phalangium lineare, commonly known as the linear phalangium, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique structure with a short, thick rhizome and a single, unbranched leaf blade. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
