    "intro": "Philodendron crassispathum, commonly known as the broad-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its stems are typically aerial, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular watering to maintain its lush foliage."
