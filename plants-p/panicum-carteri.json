    "intro": "Panicum carteri, commonly known as Carter's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
