It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and natural reserves."
