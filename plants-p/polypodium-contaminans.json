    "intro": "Polypodium contaminans, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a type of epiphytic fern that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, branching fronds that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, helping it anchor to its substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, rugged appearance."
