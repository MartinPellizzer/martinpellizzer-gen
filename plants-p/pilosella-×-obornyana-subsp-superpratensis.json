It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphological and ecological traits compared to related species. It plays a role in stabilizing alpine soils and provides habitat for various insect species."
