It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, clustered spikes of purple to reddish-pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name reflects the appearance of its fuzzy foliage and its historical use in traditional medicine."
