    "intro": "Platanthera wankelii, commonly known as the Wankel's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spiraled spikes of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine and hardwood forests. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
