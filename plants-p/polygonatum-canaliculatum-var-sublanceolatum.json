It features slender, cylindrical rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. It prefers shady, moist woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
