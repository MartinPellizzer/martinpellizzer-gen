    "intro": "Pteris guichenotii, commonly known as the Guichenot's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its spread in humid habitats."
