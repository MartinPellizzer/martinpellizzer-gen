    "intro": "Panicum minutum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and has fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
