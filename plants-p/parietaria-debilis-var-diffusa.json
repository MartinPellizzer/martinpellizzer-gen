    "intro": "Parietaria debilis var. diffusa, commonly known as the common wall lettuce, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10-30 centimeters and features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed habitats, making it both a weed and a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
