    "intro": "Polypodium phyllomanes var. doryopteris, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a variant of the huperzia fern family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky habitats. The plant has lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its fronds are characterized by a distinct midrib and a dense arrangement of small, tooth-like lobes. This variant is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
