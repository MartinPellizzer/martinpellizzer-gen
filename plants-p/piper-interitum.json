It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Piper interitum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
