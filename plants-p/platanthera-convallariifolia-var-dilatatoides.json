    "intro": "Platanthera convallariifolia var. dilatatoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States. It features a slender, unbranched stem with whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves and slightly larger flowers compared to the standard form."
