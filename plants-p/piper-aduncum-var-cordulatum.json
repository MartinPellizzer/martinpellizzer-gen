    "intro": "Piper aduncum var. cordulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf pepper or cordate pepper, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its varietal name \"cordulatum.\" The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
