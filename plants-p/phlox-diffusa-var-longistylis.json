    "intro": "Phlox diffusa var. longistylis, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover."
