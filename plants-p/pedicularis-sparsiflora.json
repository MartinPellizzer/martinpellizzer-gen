    "intro": "Pedicularis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. Native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
