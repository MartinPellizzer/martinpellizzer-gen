It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and limited moisture. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
