    "intro": "Pterostylis atrans, commonly known as the black-tongued duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, dark red or purple flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, due to their specialized morphology. The orchid's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it blend into its natural habitat."
