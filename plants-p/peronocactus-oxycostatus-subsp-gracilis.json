    "intro": "Peronocactus oxycostatus subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for small spaces, and it is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated stems compared to the typical form of Peronocactus oxycostatus."
