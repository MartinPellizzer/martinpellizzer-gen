    "intro": "Pilosella cepitina, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a flowering plant in the family Compositae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Pilosella cepitina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
