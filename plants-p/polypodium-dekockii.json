    "intro": "Polypodium dekockii, commonly known as Dekock's sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates like soil or rock. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
