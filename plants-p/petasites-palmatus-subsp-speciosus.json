    "intro": "Petasites palmatus subsp. speciosus, commonly known as the showy edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of large, silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Pyrenees. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
