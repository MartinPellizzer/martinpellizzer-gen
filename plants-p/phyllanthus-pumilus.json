    "intro": "Phyllanthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that turn red when mature, containing a single seed. Phyllanthus pumilus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and year-round foliage."
