    "intro": "Potentilla argentea f. tenuiloba, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, sunny environments like meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscape design."
