    "intro": "Poa kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Kilimanjaro. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to withstand the cold and strong winds of its alpine habitat. Poa kilimanjarica plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment."
