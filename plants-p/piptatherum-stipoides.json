It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Piptatherum stipoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
