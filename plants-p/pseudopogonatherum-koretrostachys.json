    "intro": "Pseudopogonatherum koretrostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and marshes, where it forms dense clumps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the base, with narrow, grass-like leaves emerging from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
