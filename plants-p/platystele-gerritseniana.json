    "intro": "Platystele gerritseniana, commonly known as the Gerritsen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and a single, delicate flower that is typically white or pale pink. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered critically endangered."
