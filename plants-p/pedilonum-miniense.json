    "intro": "Pedilonum miniense, commonly known as the miniature lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like daffodils and gladiolus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum miniense is considered a conservation concern."
