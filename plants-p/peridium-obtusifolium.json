    "intro": "Peridium obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf peridium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Peridium obtusifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
