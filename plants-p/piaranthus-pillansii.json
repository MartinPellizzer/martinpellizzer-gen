    "intro": "Piaranthus pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its distinctive, often ephemeral blooms. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that open only briefly during the night, typically after rain. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
