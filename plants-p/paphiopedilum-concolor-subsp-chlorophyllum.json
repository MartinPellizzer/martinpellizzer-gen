    "intro": "Paphiopedilum concolor subsp. chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green-flowered slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically green or yellowish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, green, and yellow, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
