    "intro": "Pleopeltis tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into multiple segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, releasing spores for propagation. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
