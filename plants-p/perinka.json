    "intro": "Perinka, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, perinka thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains various volatile oils and has been used historically for its medicinal and pesticidal properties. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
