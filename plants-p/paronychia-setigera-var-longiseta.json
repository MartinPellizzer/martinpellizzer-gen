    "intro": "Paronychia setigera var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-stalked sandmat, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments in southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with woody stems that bear small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, often appearing in spring. This species is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems."
