    "intro": "Polygala petraea, commonly known as the rock polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it is often found in Mediterranean climates. Polygala petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
