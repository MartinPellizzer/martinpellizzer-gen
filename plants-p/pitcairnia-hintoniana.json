    "intro": "Pitcairnia hintoniana, commonly known as the Hinton's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange, with a waxy texture. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, showy flowers, typically in shades of yellow and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia hintoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
