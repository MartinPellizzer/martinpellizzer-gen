    "intro": "Panicum prenticeanum, commonly known as Prentice's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
