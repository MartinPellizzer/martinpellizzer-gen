    "intro": "Pentaphalangium, commonly known as the five-finger plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant typically has small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short peduncles. Pentaphalangium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. These plants are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
