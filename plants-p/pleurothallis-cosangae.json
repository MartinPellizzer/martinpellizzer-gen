It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
