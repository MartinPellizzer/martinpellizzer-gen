It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
