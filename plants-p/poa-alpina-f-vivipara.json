    "intro": "Poa alpina f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass. It is characterized by its ability to produce viviparous offspring, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to propagate efficiently in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-green flowers."
