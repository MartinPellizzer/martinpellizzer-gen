    "intro": "Pistaciopsis wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's pine. It is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This plant is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and conical shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
