It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
