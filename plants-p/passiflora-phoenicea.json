    "intro": "Passiflora phoenicea, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, which are often brightly colored. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, juicy pulp. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its use in traditional medicine."
