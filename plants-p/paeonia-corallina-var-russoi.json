    "intro": "Paeonia corallina var. russoi, commonly known as the Corsican peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its vibrant coral-pink petals and dark red stamens, which create a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding a dramatic display to gardens and natural habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
