    "intro": "Protium neglectum, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Protium. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
