    "intro": "Pyrus llangollenica, commonly known as Llangollen pear, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the UK. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is a subject of conservation efforts."
