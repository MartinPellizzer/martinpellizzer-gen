    "intro": "Peristrophe baphica, commonly known as the Baphic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the base of the stem. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
