    "intro": "Pimelea aridula, commonly known as the desert banksia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Pimelea aridula is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
