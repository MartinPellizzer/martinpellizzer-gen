It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
