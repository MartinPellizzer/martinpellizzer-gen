    "intro": "Priva tenax, commonly known as the climbing bignay, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strong, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across trees and structures. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are used in traditional cuisine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Priva tenax is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in tropical and subtropical regions."
