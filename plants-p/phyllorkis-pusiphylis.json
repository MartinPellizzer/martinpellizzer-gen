It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or mauve in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Phyllorkis pusiphylis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
