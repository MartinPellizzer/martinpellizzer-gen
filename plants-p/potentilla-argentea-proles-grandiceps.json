It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
