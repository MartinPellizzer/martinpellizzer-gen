    "intro": "Pentanura khasiana, commonly known as Khasi pentanura, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance in its native region."
