    "intro": "Puccinellia strictura, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Puccinellia strictura plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
