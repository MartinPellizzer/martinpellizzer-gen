    "intro": "Philodendron dryanderae, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular houseplant, though it is toxic to pets and humans."
