    "intro": "Polypodium runcinatum, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium runcinatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
