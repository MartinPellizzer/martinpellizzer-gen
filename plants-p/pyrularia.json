These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Pyrularia species often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems."
