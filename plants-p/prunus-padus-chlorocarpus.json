    "intro": "Prunus padus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the autumn. The fruit is a small, dark red drupe that develops after the flowers, providing food for various wildlife species."
