    "intro": "Pinguicula rosmariae, commonly known as the Rosmaria's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires careful watering to avoid root rot. Pinguicula rosmariae is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
