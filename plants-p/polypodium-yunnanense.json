    "intro": "Polypodium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
