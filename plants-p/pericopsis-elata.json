    "intro": "Pericopsis elata, commonly known as African teak, is a large evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a valuable resource in the timber industry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
