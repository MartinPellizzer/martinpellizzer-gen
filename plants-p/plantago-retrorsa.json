    "intro": "Plantago retrorsa, commonly known as the backward plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
