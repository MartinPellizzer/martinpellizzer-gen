    "intro": "Panicum rigidulum var. abscissum, commonly known as the rigid panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and linear with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, bracted flowers. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
