    "intro": "Pinus montana, commonly known as the Swiss stone pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that grows in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. Its cones and needles have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of resin. Pinus montana is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or high-altitude environments."
