    "intro": "Psathyrotes, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Psathyrotes species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
