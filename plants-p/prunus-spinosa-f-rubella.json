    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. rubella, commonly known as the red-fruited blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a compact, thorny shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and its distinctive, dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are often used in making jams and liqueurs due to their high pectin content. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
