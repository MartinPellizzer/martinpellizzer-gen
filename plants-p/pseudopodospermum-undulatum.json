    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating pod seed plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, undulating seed pods that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, woolly appearance. The seeds are enclosed in the undulating pods, which split open when mature to release the seeds."
