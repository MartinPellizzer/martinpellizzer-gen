    "intro": "Phaius nanus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or white, with a delicate appearance. Phaius nanus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
