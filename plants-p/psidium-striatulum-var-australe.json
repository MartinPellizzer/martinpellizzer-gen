It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pink to red berries. The fruit has a sweet and tangy flavor, with a fibrous texture similar to other guava species. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
