    "intro": "Platystachys bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous flame grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulbous base and tall, slender stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
