    "intro": "Ptelea crenata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled trunk and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ptelea crenata is valued for its hard wood and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
