    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan false water fern, is a species of fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble those of the water ferns, though it belongs to a different family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pseudocystopteris tibetica is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
