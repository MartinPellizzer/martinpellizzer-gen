It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy white or pink flower atop a short stem. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Poaephyllum uniflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
