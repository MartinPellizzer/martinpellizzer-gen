    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. genuina, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky landscapes. The plant has silvery-white leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
