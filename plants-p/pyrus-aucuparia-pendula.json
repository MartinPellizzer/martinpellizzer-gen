    "intro": "Pyrus aucuparia pendula, commonly known as the weeping Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-green fruits known as serviceberries. The leaves are oval-shaped, dark green, and turn a striking red or purple in the fall. Native to eastern Asia, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. This plant is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types."
