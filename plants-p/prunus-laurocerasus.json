    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a fragrant aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, its berries are toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
