    "intro": "Pleurothallis caudatipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid with delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, strap-shaped leaves and has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on tree branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
