    "intro": "Psyllocarpus cururuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
