It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
