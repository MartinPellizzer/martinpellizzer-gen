    "intro": "Polygala sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred structure on the petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
