    "intro": "Pistacia terebinthina, commonly known as the turpentine tree or terebinth, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into 5 to 9 leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is known for exuding a resin that has been historically used for various purposes. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
