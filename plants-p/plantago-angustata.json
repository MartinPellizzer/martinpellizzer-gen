    "intro": "Plantago angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, leafy stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
