    "intro": "Ptilothrix deusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Ptilothrix deusta is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
