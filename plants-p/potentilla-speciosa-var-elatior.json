    "intro": "Potentilla speciosa var. elatior, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and they are covered in a fine layer of soft, white pubescence. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
