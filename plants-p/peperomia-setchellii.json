It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it an ideal plant for container cultivation."
