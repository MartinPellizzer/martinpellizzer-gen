    "intro": "Prosopanche clavata, commonly known as the clustered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are typically orange to red in color, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their mild toxicity. Prosopanche clavata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants."
