    "intro": "Pilocarpus macrocarpus, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves, which contain the compound pilocarpine, used in medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
