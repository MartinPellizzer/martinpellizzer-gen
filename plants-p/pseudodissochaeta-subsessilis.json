It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Pseudodissochaeta subsessilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
