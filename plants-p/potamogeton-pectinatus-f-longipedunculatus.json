    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus f. longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable environmental conditions."
