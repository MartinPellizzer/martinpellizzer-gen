    "intro": "Philodendron rhodoaxis, commonly known as the red-veined philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have striking red or purple veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. Its growth habit involves trailing or climbing, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a trained vine. Philodendron rhodoaxis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
