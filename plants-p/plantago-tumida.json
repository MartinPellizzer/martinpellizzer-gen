    "intro": "Plantago tumida, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The leaves and seeds of Plantago tumida have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
