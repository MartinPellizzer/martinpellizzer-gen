    "intro": "Potentilla pilosa var. auriflora, commonly known as goldenflower cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically compound, with serrated edges and a silvery-green hue due to the dense pubescence. This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
