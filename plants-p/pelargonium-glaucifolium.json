    "intro": "Pelargonium glaucifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
