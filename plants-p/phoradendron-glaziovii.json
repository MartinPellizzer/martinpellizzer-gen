    "intro": "Phoradendron glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized root system called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
