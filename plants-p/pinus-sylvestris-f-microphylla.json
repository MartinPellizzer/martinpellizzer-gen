    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact form of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its shorter, more densely packed needles compared to the typical Scots pine. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Its foliage is dark green, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
