    "intro": "Peponia, commonly known as the \"dandelion\" in some regions, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by a crown of petal-like bracts. Peponia species are typically herbaceous and can be found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They often have alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are sometimes hairy. The fruit is a dry, two-chambered capsule that releases seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal."
