    "intro": "Pteris mysorensis, commonly known as the Mysore water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pteris mysorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
