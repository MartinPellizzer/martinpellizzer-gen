    "intro": "Potentilla glaucophylla var. perdissecta, commonly known as the dissected silver cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
