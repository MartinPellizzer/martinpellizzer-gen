    "intro": "Polylepis tarapacana var. pycnolopha, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru and northern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and distinctive, rounded crown, which helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in clusters, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing fluffy, white or pale pink seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
