    "intro": "Pteris angolensis, commonly known as the Angola water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Pteris angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
