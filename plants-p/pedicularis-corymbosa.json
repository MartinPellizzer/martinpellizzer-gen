    "intro": "Pedicularis corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange. Pedicularis corymbosa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
