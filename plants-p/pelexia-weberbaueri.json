    "intro": "Pelexia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
