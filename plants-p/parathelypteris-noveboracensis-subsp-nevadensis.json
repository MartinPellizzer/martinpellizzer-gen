    "intro": "Parathelypteris noveboracensis subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
