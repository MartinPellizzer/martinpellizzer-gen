    "intro": "Paepalanthus paganuccii, commonly known as the Puna grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are often white or pale blue in color. Paepalanthus paganuccii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
