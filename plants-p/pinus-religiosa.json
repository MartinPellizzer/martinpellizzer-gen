    "intro": "Pinus religiosa, commonly known as the sacred pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The cones of Pinus religiosa are typically woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
