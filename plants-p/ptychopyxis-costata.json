    "intro": "Ptychopyxis costata, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Ptychopyxis costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
