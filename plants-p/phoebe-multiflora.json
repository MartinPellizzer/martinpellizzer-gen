It has smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
