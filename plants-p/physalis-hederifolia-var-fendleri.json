    "intro": "Physalis hederifolia var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, green to reddish-orange calyces that enclose its fruit. The fruit, which resembles a tiny tomato, is edible and has a tangy, tart flavor. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
