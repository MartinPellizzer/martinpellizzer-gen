    "intro": "Panicum cambogiense, commonly known as wild millet, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it is drought-tolerant. Panicum cambogiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
