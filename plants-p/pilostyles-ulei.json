    "intro": "Pilostyles ulei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its highly specialized relationship with its host, typically a species of Eucalyptus. The plant produces a single, elongated flower that appears to float in the air, giving it its ethereal appearance. It is native to Australia and is considered rare due to its specific ecological requirements. Pilostyles ulei is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water."
