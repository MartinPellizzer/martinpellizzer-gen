    "intro": "Parinari salicifolia, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small cherries. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
