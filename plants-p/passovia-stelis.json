    "intro": "Passovia stelis, commonly known as the star-stemmed sedge, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Passovia stelis grows in moist, often swampy habitats and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
