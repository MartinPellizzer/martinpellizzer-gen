    "intro": "Platanthera repens, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy white or greenish-white flower. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for photosynthesis."
