    "intro": "Paspalum equitans, commonly known as the common paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Paspalum equitans is valued for its use in forage and as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone environments."
