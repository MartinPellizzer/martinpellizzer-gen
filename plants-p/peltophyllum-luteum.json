    "intro": "Peltophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow star lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of water bodies. Peltophyllum luteum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
