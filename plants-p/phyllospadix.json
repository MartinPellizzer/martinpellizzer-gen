    "intro": "Phyllospadix, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Phyllospadix species are adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate salinity, making them resilient in maritime environments. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important component of coastal flora."
