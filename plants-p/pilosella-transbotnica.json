    "intro": "Pilosella transbotnica, commonly known as the Trans-Baltic mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in pollination and serves as a habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
