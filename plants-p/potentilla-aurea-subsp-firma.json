    "intro": "Potentilla aurea subsp. firma, commonly known as golden cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting floral display."
