    "intro": "Panicum durum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Panicum durum is often used in ornamental gardening for its architectural form and ability to provide winter interest."
