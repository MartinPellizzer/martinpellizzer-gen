    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita subsp. catoptera, commonly known as the mirror fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
