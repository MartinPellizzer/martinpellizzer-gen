    "intro": "Poa orthophylla, commonly known as the upright bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, Poa orthophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
