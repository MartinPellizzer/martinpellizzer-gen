    "intro": "Panicum kalmii, commonly known as Kalm's panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. Panicum kalmii is often used in erosion control due to its deep root system and drought tolerance."
