    "intro": "Pigea bennettiae, commonly known as Bennett's pigea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white to pale pink blooms that are typically tubular in shape, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
