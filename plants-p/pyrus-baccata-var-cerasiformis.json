    "intro": "Pyrus baccata var. cerasiformis, commonly known as the red-berried whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that turn reddish in autumn and its clusters of small, red berries that persist through winter. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its historical use in hedgerows and as a source of food for wildlife adds to its ecological significance."
