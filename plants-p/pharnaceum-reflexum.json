    "intro": "Pharnaceum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed pharnaceum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
