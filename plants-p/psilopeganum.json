It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that often resemble holly berries. These plants are adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy stems and leaves to store water. Psilopeganum species are typically found in desert regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They play a role in stabilizing sandy soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
