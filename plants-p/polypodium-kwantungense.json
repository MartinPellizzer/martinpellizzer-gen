    "intro": "Polypodium kwantungense, commonly known as the Kwantung holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
