    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features silver-white, hairy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
