    "intro": "Pteris cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris cartilaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
