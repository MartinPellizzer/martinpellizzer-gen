    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysophylla var. plumeriana, commonly known as the golden-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with lanceolate pinnae that are often curled when dry. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
