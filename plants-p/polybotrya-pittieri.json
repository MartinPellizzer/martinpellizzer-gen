    "intro": "Polybotrya pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, club-shaped formations along the stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages and forest ecosystems."
