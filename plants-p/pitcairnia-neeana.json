    "intro": "Pitcairnia neeana, commonly known as the Nee's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia neeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
