    "intro": "Pandanus pervilleanus, commonly known as the swamp pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. The fruit, a fibrous, spiky structure, is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in various indigenous communities."
