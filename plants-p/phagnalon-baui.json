    "intro": "Phagnalon baui, commonly known as the white clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is a perennial herb that spreads by both seeds and stolons, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Phagnalon baui plays an important ecological role by improving soil fertility and providing forage for livestock."
