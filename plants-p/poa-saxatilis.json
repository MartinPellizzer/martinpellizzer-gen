    "intro": "Poa saxatilis, commonly known as the mountain grass or saxatile bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue-green flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Poa saxatilis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
