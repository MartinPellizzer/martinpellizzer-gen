    "intro": "Populus kangdingensis var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, with a fibrous texture. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
