    "intro": "Pyrus aestivalis, commonly known as the summer pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin with a slightly serrated edge. The summer pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
