    "intro": "Platanthera minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
