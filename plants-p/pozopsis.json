It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. These plants are native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Pozopsis species are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance in their native habitats."
