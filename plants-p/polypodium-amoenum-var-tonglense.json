    "intro": "Polypodium amoenum var. tonglense, commonly known as the Tongling water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
