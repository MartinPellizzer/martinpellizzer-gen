    "intro": "Panicum confertum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, silver-gray blades with a textured surface that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract wildlife contribute to its ecological value."
