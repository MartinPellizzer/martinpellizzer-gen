    "intro": "Prosthechea calamaria, commonly known as the calamary orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The orchid blooms during the rainy season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
