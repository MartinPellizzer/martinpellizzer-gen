    "intro": "Potentilla leucopolitana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a silvery underside that reflects light, aiding in heat dissipation. Potentilla leucopolitana is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
