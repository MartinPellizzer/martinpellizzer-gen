    "intro": "Polypleurum pluricostatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
