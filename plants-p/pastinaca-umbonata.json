    "intro": "Pastinaca umbonata, commonly known as the horned sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble small daisies. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has a short life cycle, typically flowering and setting seed within a single growing season. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it is often mistaken for other similar species in the same family."
