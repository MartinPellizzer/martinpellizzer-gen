    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. scariosa, commonly known as the scaly pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 7 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or mountainous regions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
