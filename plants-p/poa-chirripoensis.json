    "intro": "Poa chirripoensis, commonly known as the Chirrip\u00f3 grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Poa chirripoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its limited distribution makes it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native range."
