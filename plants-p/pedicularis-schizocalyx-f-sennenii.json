    "intro": "Pedicularis schizocalyx f. sennenii, commonly known as the Senn's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its reddish-purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in high-altitude environments. It is a flowering plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and parasitism."
