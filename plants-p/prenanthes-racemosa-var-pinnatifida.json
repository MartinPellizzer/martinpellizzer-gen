    "intro": "Prenanthes racemosa var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender false ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose racemes, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. This variant is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and is often found in the eastern and central United States."
