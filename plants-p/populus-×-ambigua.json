    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America. It is a natural hybrid between *Populus tremuloides* (quaking aspen) and *Populus balsamifera* (balsam poplar), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are ovate to triangular in shape, with serrated margins and a rough texture due to the presence of small glands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
