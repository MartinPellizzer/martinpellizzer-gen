It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
