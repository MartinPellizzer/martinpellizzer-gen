    "intro": "Pteris succulenta, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
