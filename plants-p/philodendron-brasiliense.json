    "intro": "Philodendron brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that can grow quite large. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences, which are typically hidden beneath its broad, waxy foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening, though it can be toxic if ingested."
