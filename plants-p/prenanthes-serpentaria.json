It features striking, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
