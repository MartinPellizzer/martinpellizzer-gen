    "intro": "Phlomis simplex, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture. Phlomis simplex is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
