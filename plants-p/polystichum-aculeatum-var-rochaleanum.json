    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. rochaleanum, commonly known as the Rochalean rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped, and serrated fronds that are often covered with small, stiff spines. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers cool, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative element in shaded landscapes."
