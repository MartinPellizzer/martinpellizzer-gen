It features thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tabletop displays."
