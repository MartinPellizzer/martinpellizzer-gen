    "intro": "Phaca ochreata, commonly known as the ochre sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in maritime ecosystems. Phaca ochreata is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
