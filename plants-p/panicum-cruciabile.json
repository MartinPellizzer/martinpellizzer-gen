    "intro": "Panicum cruciabile, commonly known as cross-leaved panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped leaf bases, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of seeds. Panicum cruciabile is often found in wetland ecosystems and is considered an indicator species for certain wetland types."
