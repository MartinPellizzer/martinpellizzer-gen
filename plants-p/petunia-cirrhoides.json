    "intro": "Petunia cirrhoides, commonly known as the silverleaf petunia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, with five petals and a tubular throat. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
