    "intro": "Parashorea plicata, commonly known as the flat-leafed talaud, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
