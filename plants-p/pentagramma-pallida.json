    "intro": "Pentagramma pallida, commonly known as the pale starwort, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its small, white to pale green flowers appear in late spring and are clustered in dense, star-like formations. Pentagramma pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
