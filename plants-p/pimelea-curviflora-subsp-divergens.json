It features narrow, linear leaves and produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, showy clusters. The plant is typically found in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated floral bracts compared to other Pimelea species."
