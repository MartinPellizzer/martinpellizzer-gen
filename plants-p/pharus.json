    "intro": "Pharus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers and are often found in coastal areas. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, which helps them adapt to saline environments. Pharus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and hardiness. They play an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
