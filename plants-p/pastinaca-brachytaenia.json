    "intro": "Pastinaca brachytaenia, commonly known as the short-stalked burdock, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spiky fruits that mature into brown, bur-like structures. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
