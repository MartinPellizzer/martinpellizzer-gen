    "intro": "Pedicularis flammea, commonly known as the flame pink. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers, which are often borne on slender, erect stems. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Pedicularis flammea typically blooms in late summer and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
