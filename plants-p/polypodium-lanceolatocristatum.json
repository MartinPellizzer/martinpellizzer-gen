    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatocristatum, commonly known as the crested sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with distinctive, raised, wavy margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on rocky or moist soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its unique botanical appeal."
