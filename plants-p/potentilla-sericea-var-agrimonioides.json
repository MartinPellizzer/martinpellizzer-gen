    "intro": "Potentilla sericea var. agrimonioides, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically five-petaled and arranged in a corymb. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
