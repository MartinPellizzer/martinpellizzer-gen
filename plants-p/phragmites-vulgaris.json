    "intro": "Phragmites vulgaris, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of brown, feathery flowers. This plant is highly invasive and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a significant ecological factor in wetland ecosystems."
