It features wiry, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or cushions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface and a pointed tip. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
