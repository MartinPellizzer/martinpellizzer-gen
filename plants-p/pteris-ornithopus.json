    "intro": "Pteris ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, loosely clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces upright, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy surface. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pteris ornithopus is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
