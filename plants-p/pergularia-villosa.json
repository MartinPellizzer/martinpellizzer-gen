    "intro": "Pergularia villosa, commonly known as the hairy pogostemon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features opposite, hairy leaves that are often rounded or ovate in shape. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Pergularia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
