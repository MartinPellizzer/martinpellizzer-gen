    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum subsp. crispum, commonly known as parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and used extensively in cooking. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into small, rounded fruits called umbels. Its growth habit includes a rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that emerge from the center. The botanical features of parsley make it a valuable plant in both culinary and horticultural contexts."
