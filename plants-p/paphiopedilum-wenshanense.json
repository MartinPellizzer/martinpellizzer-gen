    "intro": "Paphiopedilum wenshanense, commonly known as the Wenshan slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a defining feature of the orchid family. The plant typically produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
