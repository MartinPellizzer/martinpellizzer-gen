    "intro": "Polypodium aequale, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizome and fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium aequale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
