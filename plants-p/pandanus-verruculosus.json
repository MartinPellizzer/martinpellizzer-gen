    "intro": "Pandanus verruculosus, commonly known as the rough pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its robust, spiky leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their strong, fibrous texture. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
