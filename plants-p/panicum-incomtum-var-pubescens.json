It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
