    "intro": "Phegopteris keraudreniana, commonly known as the Keraudren's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
