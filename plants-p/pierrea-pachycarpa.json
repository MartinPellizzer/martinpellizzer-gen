    "intro": "Pierrea pachycarpa, commonly known as the hardy rock parsley, is a perennial plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and native plant collections."
