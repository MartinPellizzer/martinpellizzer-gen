    "intro": "Piptocoma ekmanii, commonly known as the Hawaiian puka-puka, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Piptocoma ekmanii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
