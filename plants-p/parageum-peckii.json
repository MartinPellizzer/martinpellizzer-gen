    "intro": "Parageum peckii, commonly known as the Peck's parageum, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Parageum peckii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
