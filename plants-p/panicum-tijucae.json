    "intro": "Panicum tijucae, commonly known as Tijuana grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loose, feathery panicles of small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh, coastal environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
