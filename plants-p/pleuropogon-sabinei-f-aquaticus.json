    "intro": "Pleuropogon sabinei f. aquaticus, commonly known as the aquatic false panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its growth habit is adapted to aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy substrates. This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
