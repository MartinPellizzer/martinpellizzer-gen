    "intro": "Pterostylis cucullata, commonly known as the hooded greenhood, is an orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, often obscured leaf. The plant produces a single, greenish-brown flower that is hooded and resembles a small helmet. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, particularly thynnine wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral structure."
