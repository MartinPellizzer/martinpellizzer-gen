    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the London plane tree with a pyramidal form, is a cultivated variant of the London plane tree. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. The tree features palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its bark is thick, fissured, and flaky. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it is relatively disease-resistant. This form is prized for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to city environments."
