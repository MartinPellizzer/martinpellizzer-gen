    "intro": "Physaria purpurea, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Physaria purpurea is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
