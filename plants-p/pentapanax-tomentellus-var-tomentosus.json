    "intro": "Pentapanax tomentellus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy pentapanax, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into multiple leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
