    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate pear, is a variant of the pear tree characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in taste to common pears. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which displays a striking color change from bright green to vibrant red in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its fruit-bearing potential."
