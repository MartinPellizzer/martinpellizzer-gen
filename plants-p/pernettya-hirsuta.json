    "intro": "Pernettya hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Pernettya hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
