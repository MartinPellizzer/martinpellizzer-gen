    "intro": "Prunus tarda, commonly known as the late cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries in late summer. Prunus tarda thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
