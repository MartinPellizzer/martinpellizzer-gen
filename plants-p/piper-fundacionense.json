    "intro": "Piper fundacionense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pepper or Fundaci\u00f3n pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, turning red upon ripening. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
