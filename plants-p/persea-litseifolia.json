    "intro": "Persea litseifolia, commonly known as the white mahoe, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
