    "intro": "Psychotria paludosa, commonly known as swamp psychotria, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, swampy areas and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Psychotria paludosa is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves."
