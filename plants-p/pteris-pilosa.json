    "intro": "Pteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, toothed pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value. Pteris pilosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
