    "intro": "Phemeranthus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its short lifespan, blooming and dying within a few weeks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert environments. Due to its brief flowering period, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native habitat."
