    "intro": "Pyrus morula, commonly known as the Japanese nashi or Chinese white pear, is a small deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. Pyrus morula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary qualities."
