    "intro": "Pilea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine pilea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
