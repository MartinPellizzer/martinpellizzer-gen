    "intro": "Petrophyes muralis subsp. subcrassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed wall geometer, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow on rocky or calcareous substrates. It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers, typically arranged in dense inflorescences, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It is found in rocky crevices and cliff faces, often in Mediterranean or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
