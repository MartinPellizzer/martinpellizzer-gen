    "intro": "Phillyrea medianifolia f. majorifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with large, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. This variety is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical form of Phillyrea medianifolia."
