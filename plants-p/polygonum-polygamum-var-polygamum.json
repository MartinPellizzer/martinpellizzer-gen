    "intro": "Polygonum polygamum var. polygamum, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and restoration projects."
