    "intro": "Podophyllum esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's pepperweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces dark red to black berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
