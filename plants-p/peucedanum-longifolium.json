    "intro": "Peucedanum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive parsley-like aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum longifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
