    "intro": "Phemeranthus brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed ephemeral, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, upright stem. Due to its short life cycle and brief flowering period, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local pollinator dynamics."
