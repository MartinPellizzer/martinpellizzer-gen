    "intro": "Potentilla mollissima var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant silverweed, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
