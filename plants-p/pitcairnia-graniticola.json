    "intro": "Pitcairnia graniticola, commonly known as the granite pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched stem bearing numerous small, showy flowers. Pitcairnia graniticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
