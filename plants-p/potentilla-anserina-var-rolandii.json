    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. rolandii, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters of five, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
