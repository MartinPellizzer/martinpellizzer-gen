It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
