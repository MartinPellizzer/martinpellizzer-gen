    "intro": "Pandanus bemarahensis, commonly known as the Bemara hibiscus, is a unique member of the Pandanus genus native to the island of Bemara in Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender tree structure with spirally arranged leaves that are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fibrous leaves are used by local communities for weaving and crafting traditional items. The species is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
