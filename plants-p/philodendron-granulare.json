    "intro": "Philodendron granulare, commonly known as the granular philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that have a distinctive granular texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron granulare is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
