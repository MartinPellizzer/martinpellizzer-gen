    "intro": "Poa spillmanii, commonly known as Spillman's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa spillmanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
