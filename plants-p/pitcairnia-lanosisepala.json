    "intro": "Pitcairnia lanosisepala, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-colored inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rosette-shaped leaves are typically broad and stiff, forming a tight cluster that holds rainwater. This species is well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments and is appreciated for its ornamental value."
