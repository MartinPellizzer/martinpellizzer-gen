    "intro": "Pyrus palcensis, commonly known as the ancient pear, is a rare and extinct species of the pear genus. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits with a smooth, thin skin. The plant likely had a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. Its flowers were probably white or pale yellow, typical of many pear species. Due to its extinction, very little is known about its full botanical characteristics and ecological role."
