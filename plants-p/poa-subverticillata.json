    "intro": "Poa subverticillata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms tufts or clumps, with flowering stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, three-angled seeds. Poa subverticillata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest floors."
