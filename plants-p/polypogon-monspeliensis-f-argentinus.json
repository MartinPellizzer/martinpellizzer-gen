It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, with bright red to orange bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like blades that are often covered in fine hairs. This fern-like grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native environment."
