    "intro": "Poa resinulosa, commonly known as the resinous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are often coated with a waxy residue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Poa resinulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
