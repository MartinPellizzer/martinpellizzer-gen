    "intro": "Prenanthes scandens, commonly known as the climbing arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often notched and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
