    "intro": "Ptarmica alpina, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that form a rosette and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Ptarmica alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is a hardy species that can tolerate frost and strong winds. Its botanical features make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in alpine habitats."
