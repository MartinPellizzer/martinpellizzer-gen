It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that often display variegation with white or yellow margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits known as whitebeams. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats."
