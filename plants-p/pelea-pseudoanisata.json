    "intro": "Pelea pseudoanisata, commonly known as the false anise plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial herb with aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
