    "intro": "Peristylus tobensis, commonly known as the Tobi Islands peristylus, is a flowering plant native to the Tobi Islands in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, black berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peristylus tobensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
