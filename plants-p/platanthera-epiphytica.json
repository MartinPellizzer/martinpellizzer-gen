    "intro": "Platanthera epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species that grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded forest environments. It is an epiphyte, meaning it derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around its host rather than from soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Platanthera epiphytica is considered endangered in many areas."
