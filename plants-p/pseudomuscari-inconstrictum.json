    "intro": "Pseudomuscari inconstrictum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed muscari, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Pseudomuscari inconstrictum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively low maintenance requirements."
