It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. The berries are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine."
