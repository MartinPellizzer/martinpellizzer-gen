    "intro": "Pollichia vulgaris, commonly known as the common pollichia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
