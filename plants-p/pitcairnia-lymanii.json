    "intro": "Pitcairnia lymanii, commonly known as the Lyman's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by the plant for hydration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that surround small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
