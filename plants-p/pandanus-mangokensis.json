It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, crown-like structure. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. The species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt spray and wind."
