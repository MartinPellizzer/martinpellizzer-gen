    "intro": "Polypodium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along a central axis. Polypodium vestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
