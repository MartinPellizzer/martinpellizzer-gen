    "intro": "Phthirusa adunca var. rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved phthirusa, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
