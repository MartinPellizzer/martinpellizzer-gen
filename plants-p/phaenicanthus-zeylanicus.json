    "intro": "Phaenicanthus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
