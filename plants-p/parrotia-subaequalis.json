    "intro": "Parrotia subaequalis, commonly known as the Persian parrotia, is a deciduous tree native to the forests of western and central Iran. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Parrotia subaequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal color changes."
