    "intro": "Pasania cuspidata f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pasania, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in narrow spikes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
