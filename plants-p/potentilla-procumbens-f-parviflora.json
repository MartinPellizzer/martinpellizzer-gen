    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
