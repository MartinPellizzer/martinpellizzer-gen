    "intro": "Punica granatum f. pleniflora, commonly known as the double-flowered pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate plant characterized by its abundant, double blooms. It produces showy, crimson flowers with multiple layers of petals, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant retains the typical structure of Punica granatum, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and spiny stems. While it does not bear fruit as reliably as the common pomegranate, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to floral arrangements and landscapes."
