    "intro": "Philibertella elegans, commonly known as the elegant philibertella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
