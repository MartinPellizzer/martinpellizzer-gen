It features slender, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
