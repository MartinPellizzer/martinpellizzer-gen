    "intro": "Potamogeton ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, slender stems that grow horizontally beneath the water's surface, often forming dense vegetation in shallow lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. It is also an important indicator species for water quality and ecological health."
