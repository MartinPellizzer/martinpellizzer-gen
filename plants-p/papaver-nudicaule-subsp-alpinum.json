    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and erect. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine environments."
