    "intro": "Persea obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the petiole. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, orange-yellow berries in the fall. Its fruit is similar in appearance to the common persimmon but has a unique, slightly tart flavor. Persea obovatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
