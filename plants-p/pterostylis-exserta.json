    "intro": "Pterostylis exserta, commonly known as the slender greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like labellum and a single, slender stem that produces a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually green or yellow-green, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. Pterostylis exserta is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in humid conditions and is often found in association with other rainforest flora."
