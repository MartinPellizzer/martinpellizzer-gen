    "intro": "Pittosporum clementis, commonly known as the White Pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage that turns yellow in autumn, and it produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during spring. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated margin. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Pittosporum clementis prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens."
