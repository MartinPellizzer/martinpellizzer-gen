    "intro": "Phleum fallax, commonly known as the false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, two-lobed flowers. Phleum fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
