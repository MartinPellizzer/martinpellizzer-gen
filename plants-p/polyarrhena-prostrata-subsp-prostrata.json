    "intro": "Polyarrhena prostrata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate polyarrhena, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
