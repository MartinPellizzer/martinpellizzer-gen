    "intro": "Paspalum lividum, commonly known as silver paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in natural landscapes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, pale green to brownish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Paspalum lividum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
