    "intro": "Potamogeton fontigenus, commonly known as the Fontignan watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in freshwater lakes and slow-moving rivers, forming dense underwater stands. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Potamogeton fontigenus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
