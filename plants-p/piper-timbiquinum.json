It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the forest floor. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical in shape, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in clusters and give way to small, round berries that turn red when mature."
