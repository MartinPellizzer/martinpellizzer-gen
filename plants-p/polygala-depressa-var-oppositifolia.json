    "intro": "Polygala depressa var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, ascending stems and small, clustered leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
