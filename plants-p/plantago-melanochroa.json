    "intro": "Plantago melanochroa, commonly known as black-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
