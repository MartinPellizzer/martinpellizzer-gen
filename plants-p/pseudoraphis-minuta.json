    "intro": "Pseudoraphis minuta, commonly known as the dwarf false lily-of-the-valley, is a small, perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curled, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in arid or semi-arid climates."
