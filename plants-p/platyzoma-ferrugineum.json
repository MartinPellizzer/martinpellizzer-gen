    "intro": "Platyzoma ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rusty-colored leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. It has a sympodial growth habit, with new shoots emerging from the base of the previous stem. The orchid's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding substrate, which is typical of many orchid species."
