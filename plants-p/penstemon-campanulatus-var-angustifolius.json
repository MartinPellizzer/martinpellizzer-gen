    "intro": "Penstemon campanulatus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to both ecological and ornamental value."
