    "intro": "Phlox paniculata, commonly known as garden phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, purple, and red, blooming in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its stems are usually erect and somewhat hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phlox paniculata thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
