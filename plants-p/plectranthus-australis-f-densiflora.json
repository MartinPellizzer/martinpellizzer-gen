It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant, purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its aromatic leaves release a minty scent when crushed, and it is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
