    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia f. buxifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Phillyrea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are leathery and closely resemble those of boxwood, giving it a dense, formal appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its slow growth and resistance to pests and diseases."
