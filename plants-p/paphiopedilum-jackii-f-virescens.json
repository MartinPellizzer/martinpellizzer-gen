    "intro": "Paphiopedilum jackii f. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, a feature common among orchids in the genus Paphiopedilum. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, with lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. Its flowers, which are predominantly green with subtle yellow and white markings, bloom in late spring or early summer. This cultivar is highly valued by orchid enthusiasts for its unusual coloration and elegant appearance."
