    "intro": "Pedicularis recurva var. polyantha, commonly known as the pink monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
