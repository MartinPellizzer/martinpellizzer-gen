    "intro": "Pittosporum floribundum, commonly known as the sweet Pittosporum, is a flowering shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a fragrant scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for some bird species."
