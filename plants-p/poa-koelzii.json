    "intro": "Poa koelzii, commonly known as Koelz's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa koelzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
