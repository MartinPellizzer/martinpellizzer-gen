    "intro": "Pediocactus bradyi var. knowltonii, commonly known as the Knowlton's hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
