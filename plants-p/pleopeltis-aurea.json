    "intro": "Pleopeltis aurea, commonly known as the golden pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to gold-colored fronds that contrast with its dark green veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, forming dense, compact colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are pinnately compound with lanceolate lobes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
