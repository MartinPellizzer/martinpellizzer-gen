    "intro": "Pennisetum tetrastachyum, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features slender, arching blades that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a feathery appearance due to its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically beneficial."
