    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. araucanum, commonly known as the Araucanian holly fern, is a perennial fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
