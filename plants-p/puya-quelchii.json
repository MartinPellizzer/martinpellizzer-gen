    "intro": "Puya quelchii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and form a rosette that helps collect moisture from the misty mountain air. Puya quelchii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil."
