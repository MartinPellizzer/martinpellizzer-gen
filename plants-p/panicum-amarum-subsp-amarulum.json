    "intro": "Panicum amarum subsp. amarulum, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is characterized by its distinctive bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
