    "intro": "Picea mariana f. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff spruce, is a compact, columnar form of the black spruce. It is native to the boreal regions of North America, particularly in Canada and Alaska. This variety has narrow, dark green needles and a dense, upright growth habit. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, acidic soils. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived tree, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
