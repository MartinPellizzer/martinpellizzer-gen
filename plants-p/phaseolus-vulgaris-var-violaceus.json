    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. violaceus, commonly known as the purple hull pea, is a variant of the common bean characterized by its striking violet to purple pod and seed coloration. This variety originates from the southern United States and is widely cultivated for its edible beans, which are prized for their rich flavor and nutritional value. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with climbing vines, producing tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soil. The purple hull pea is a popular choice for both home gardens and commercial agriculture due to its adaptability and high yield."
