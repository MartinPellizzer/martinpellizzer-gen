    "intro": "Pteris setifera, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and pinnately compound. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to damp soil or rock surfaces. Pteris setifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
