    "intro": "Potentilla canescens subvar. leiotricha, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
