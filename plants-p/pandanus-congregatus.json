    "intro": "Pandanus congregatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that often form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. Pandanus congregatus is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural fibers due to its durable and flexible leaves."
