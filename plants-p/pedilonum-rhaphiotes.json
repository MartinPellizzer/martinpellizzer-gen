    "intro": "Pedilonum rhaphiotes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
