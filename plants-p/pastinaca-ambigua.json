    "intro": "Pastinaca ambigua, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial or perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are clustered in the shape of a flat-topped or spherical head. Its root is cylindrical and can be yellow or white, often with a strong, aromatic scent. Pastinaca ambigua is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
