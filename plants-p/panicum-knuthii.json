    "intro": "Panicum knuthii, commonly known as Knuth's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
