    "intro": "Panicum philadelphicum subsp. lithophilum, commonly known as the rock panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
