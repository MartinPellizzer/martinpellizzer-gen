    "intro": "Psidium caudatum, commonly known as the flame tree or caudatum guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Psidium caudatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in warm climates for both its flowers and fruit."
