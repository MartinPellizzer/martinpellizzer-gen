    "intro": "Phegopteris sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with a central vein and small, sparsely distributed pinnae. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
