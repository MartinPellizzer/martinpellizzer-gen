    "intro": "Phyllostachys aurea f. flavescensinversa, commonly known as the reverse yellow bamboo, is a unique variant of the golden bamboo species. It is characterized by its striking reverse coloration, where the inner surface of the culms exhibits a golden-yellow hue while the outer surface remains green. This variegation is a result of genetic mutation and is most prominent in the younger growths. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows to a height of approximately 3 to 5 meters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
