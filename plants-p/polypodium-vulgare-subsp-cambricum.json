    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. cambricum, commonly known as the British maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
