    "intro": "Plantago altissima, commonly known as greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are arranged in two separate clusters on the stem. It is a hardy species that thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The leaves are covered in tiny hairs and contain mucilage, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
