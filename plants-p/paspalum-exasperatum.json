    "intro": "Paspalum exasperatum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and inflorescence that consists of dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Paspalum exasperatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
