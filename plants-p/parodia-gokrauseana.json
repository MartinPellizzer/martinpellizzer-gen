    "intro": "Parodia gokrauseana, commonly known as the Gokrausean cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and rock gardens."
