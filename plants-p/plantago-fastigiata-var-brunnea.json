    "intro": "Plantago fastigiata var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-stem plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, glabrous stems that are typically brownish in color, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant produces dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowering stems bear whorls of pale greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental properties."
