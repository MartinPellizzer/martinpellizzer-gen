    "intro": "Paphiopedilum barbigerum var. vejvarutianum, commonly known as the Vejvarutian slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers are usually a mix of green, yellow, and brown, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
