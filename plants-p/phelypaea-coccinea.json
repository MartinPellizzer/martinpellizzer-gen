    "intro": "Phelypaea coccinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often display a striking red or orange hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like soil or tree bark. Phelypaea coccinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant coloration and graceful appearance."
