    "intro": "Psiadia decaryi, commonly known as the Madagascar star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Psiadia decaryi is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native region. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside of Madagascar."
