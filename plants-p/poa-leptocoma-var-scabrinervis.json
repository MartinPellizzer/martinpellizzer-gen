    "intro": "Poa leptocoma var. scabrinervis, commonly known as the rough-nerved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered with small, rough hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
