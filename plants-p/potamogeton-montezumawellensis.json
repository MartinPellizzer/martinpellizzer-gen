    "intro": "Potamogeton montezumawellensis, commonly known as the Montezuma water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
