    "intro": "Polystichum pycnopterum, commonly known as the dense fern or thick-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Polystichum pycnopterum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
