    "intro": "Physochlaina urceolata, commonly known as the bell-shaped nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
