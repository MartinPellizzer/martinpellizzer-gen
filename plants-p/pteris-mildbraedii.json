    "intro": "Pteris mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically light green with a finely textured appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris mildbraedii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
