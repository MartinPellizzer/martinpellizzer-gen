It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
