    "intro": "Panicum horizontale var. subcompositum, commonly known as the horizontal panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, horizontal stems that spread across the ground, often forming dense, carpet-like colonies. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feathery flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
