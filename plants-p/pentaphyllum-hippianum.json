    "intro": "Pentaphyllum hippianum, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus rather than true roots, stems, or leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stem with lateral branches and is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Pentaphyllum hippianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
