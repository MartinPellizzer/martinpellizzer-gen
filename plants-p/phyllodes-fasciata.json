    "intro": "Phyllodes fasciata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its phyllodes are often covered with fine hairs and can vary in color from green to reddish-brown depending on the season. Phyllodes fasciata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
