    "intro": "Phyla nodiflora var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf prostrate nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
