    "intro": "Pterostylis foliata, commonly known as the leafy greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique leaf-like structure that resembles foliage, which helps it blend into its natural environment. The plant produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often hidden among the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and woodland areas. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
