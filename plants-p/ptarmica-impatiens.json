    "intro": "Ptarmica impatiens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate moist, shady areas. While it is an ornamental plant in gardens, it can become invasive in natural habitats if not managed carefully."
