    "intro": "Procris hypocrypta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It possesses a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and a single, slender stem that supports its showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Its flowers are typically small, with three petals and three sepals, and are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Procris hypocrypta is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
