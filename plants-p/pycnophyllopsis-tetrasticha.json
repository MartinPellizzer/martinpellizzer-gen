    "intro": "Pycnophyllopsis tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-branch clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and the presence of spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Pycnophyllopsis tetrasticha is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
