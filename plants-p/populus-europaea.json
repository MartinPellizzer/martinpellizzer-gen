    "intro": "Populus europaea, commonly known as the European aspen, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive white underside on the branches. The European aspen plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
