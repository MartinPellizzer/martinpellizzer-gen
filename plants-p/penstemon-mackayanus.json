    "intro": "Penstemon mackayanus, commonly known as the Mackay's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon mackayanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support native pollinators."
