    "intro": "Polygala baetica, commonly known as the Spanish milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, calcareous soils, often in rocky or scrubland habitats. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala baetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
