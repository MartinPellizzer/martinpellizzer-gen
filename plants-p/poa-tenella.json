    "intro": "Poa tenella, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Poa tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic."
