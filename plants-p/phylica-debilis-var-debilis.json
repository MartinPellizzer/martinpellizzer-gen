    "intro": "Phylica debilis var. debilis, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The silver tree is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
