    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. costata, commonly known as the costate meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct ridge or costae running along the midrib, giving it its subspecies name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often used in landscaping and turfgrass management due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
