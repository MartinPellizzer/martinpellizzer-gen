    "intro": "Polypodium pusillum, commonly known as the small polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dichotomously divided, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Polypodium pusillum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
