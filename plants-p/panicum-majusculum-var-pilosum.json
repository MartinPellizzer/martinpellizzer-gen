    "intro": "Panicum majusculum var. pilosum, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and soft, silky foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-brown florets that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
