    "intro": "Panicum corymbiferum, commonly known as the purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with purple or red hues. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental and forage grass. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration projects and as a landscape plant."
