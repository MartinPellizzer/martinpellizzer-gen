    "intro": "Polypodium sheareri, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fern produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in groups."
