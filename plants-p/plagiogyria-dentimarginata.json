    "intro": "Plagiogyria dentimarginata, commonly known as the toothed margin fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
