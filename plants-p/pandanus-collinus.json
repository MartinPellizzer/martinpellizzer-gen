It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense crown, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional crafts, and the leaves are used for thatching and weaving. Pandanus collinus thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
