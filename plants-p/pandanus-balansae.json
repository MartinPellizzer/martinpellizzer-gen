It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland areas, where it can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. Its fruit, which is a large, fibrous structure, contains seeds that are dispersed by water and animals.
