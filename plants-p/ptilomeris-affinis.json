    "intro": "Ptilomeris affinis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open woodlands. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
