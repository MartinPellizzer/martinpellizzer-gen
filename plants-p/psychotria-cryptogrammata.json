    "intro": "Psychotria cryptogrammata, commonly known as the \"cryptogrammatum\" or \"black psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
