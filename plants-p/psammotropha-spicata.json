    "intro": "Psammotropha spicata, commonly known as the spiny sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Psammotropha spicata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas."
