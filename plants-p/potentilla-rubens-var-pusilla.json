It features small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
