    "intro": "Pilea angulata var. stipulosa, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, velvety foliage with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that have a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
