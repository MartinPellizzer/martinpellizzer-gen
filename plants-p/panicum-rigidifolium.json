    "intro": "Panicum rigidifolium, commonly known as rigid-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
