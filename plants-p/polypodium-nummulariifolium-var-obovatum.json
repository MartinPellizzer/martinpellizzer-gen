    "intro": "Polypodium nummulariifolium var. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
