    "intro": "Primula gemmifera subsp. zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambales primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation via gemmae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
