It consists of several species native to Europe and western Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plants have simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. Plectreca species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
