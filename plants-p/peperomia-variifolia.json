It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and pink. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of red or purple. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
