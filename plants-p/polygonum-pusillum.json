    "intro": "Polygonum pusillum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, and appear in late summer. Polygonum pusillum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable early successional plant."
