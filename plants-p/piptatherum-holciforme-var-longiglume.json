    "intro": "Piptatherum holciforme var. longiglume, commonly known as the tall beakgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense inflorescences composed of spikelets, with the distinctive long glumes giving it its varietal name. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
