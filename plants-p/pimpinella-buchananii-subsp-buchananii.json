    "intro": "Pimpinella buchananii subsp. buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions of southern Africa. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used traditionally in herbal remedies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
