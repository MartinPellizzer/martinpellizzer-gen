    "intro": "Pinguicula floridensis, commonly known as the Florida butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
