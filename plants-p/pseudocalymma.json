    "intro": "Pseudocalymma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Pseudocalymma species have small, strap-like leaves and produce showy, usually white or pale-colored blooms. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are often considered endangered and are of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
