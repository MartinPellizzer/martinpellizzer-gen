    "intro": "Panicum holochrysum, commonly known as golden panicum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
