    "intro": "Paratriaina xerophila var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy xerophyte, is a shrub adapted to arid environments. It features small, thick leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are often clustered together, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is native to regions with low rainfall and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
