    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata f. eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. This plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties and is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
