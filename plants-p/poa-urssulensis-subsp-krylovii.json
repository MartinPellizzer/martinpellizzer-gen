    "intro": "Poa urssulensis subsp. krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
