    "intro": "Polemonium biflorum, commonly known as the twin-flower phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
