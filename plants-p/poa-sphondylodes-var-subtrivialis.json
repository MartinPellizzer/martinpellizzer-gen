    "intro": "Poa sphondylodes var. subtrivialis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant."
