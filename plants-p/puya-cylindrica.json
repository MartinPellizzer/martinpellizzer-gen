    "intro": "Puya cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical puya, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, adorned with dense clusters of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base of the stem. Puya cylindrica is known for its long flowering period and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
