    "intro": "Pycnanthemum verticillatum, commonly known as sweet peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, aromatic leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant, glandular leaves that emit a strong, minty scent. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
