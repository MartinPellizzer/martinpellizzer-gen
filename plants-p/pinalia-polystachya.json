    "intro": "Pinalia polystachya, commonly known as the long-stalked pinyon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, often multi-branched structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pinalia polystachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
