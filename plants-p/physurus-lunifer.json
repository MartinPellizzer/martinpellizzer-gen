    "intro": "Physurus lunifer, commonly known as the moon moth, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions. It produces striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems branching out from the base. The botanical significance of Physurus lunifer lies in its unique adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in supporting specialized ecosystems."
