    "intro": "Prunus nana f. spathulata, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, bright red berries in late summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant due to its compact size and hardy nature. The foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking both ornamental and ecological benefits."
