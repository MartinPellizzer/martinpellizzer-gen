It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red-orange fruits. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that provide attractive foliage throughout the growing season. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty. This variety is more compact than the typical Prunus demissa, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
