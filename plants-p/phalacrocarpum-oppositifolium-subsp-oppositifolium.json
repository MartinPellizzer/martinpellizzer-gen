    "intro": "Phalacrocarpum oppositifolium subsp. oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved phalacrocarpum, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Cephalotaceae. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
