    "intro": "Panax platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China and is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad leaves and a single, fleshy root. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it highly valued in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, Panax platyphyllus is often sought after by herbalists and researchers."
