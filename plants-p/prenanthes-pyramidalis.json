    "intro": "Prenanthes pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, pyramidal shape, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in spikelets. Prenanthes pyramidalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
