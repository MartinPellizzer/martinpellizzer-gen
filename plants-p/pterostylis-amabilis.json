    "intro": "Pterostylis amabilis, commonly known as the elegant greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which features a hood-like structure formed by the sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the scent and color of the blooms. Pterostylis amabilis is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves."
