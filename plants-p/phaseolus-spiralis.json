    "intro": "Phaseolus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral bean, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, though it is not as widely cultivated as other Phaseolus species. Its botanical features include compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant is sometimes grown as an ornamental due to its unique floral structure."
