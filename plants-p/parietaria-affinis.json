    "intro": "Parietaria affinis, commonly known as the wall pennywort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as walls, rocks, and damp soil. It produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Parietaria affinis is known for its ability to thrive in urban settings, making it a common weed in gardens and along pathways."
