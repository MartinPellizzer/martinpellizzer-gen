    "intro": "Pedicularis keiskei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble orchids. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
