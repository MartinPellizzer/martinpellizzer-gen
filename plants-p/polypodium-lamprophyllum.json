    "intro": "Polypodium lamprophyllum, commonly known as the shining polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks, tree trunks, or soil in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive glossy appearance, especially when young."
