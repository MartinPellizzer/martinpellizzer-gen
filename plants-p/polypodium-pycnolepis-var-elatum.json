    "intro": "Polypodium pycnolepis var. elatum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern that is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to shaded, moist environments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded areas with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, lush foliage."
