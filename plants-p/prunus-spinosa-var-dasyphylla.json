    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the dense-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, black berries that ripen in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental and ecological value."
