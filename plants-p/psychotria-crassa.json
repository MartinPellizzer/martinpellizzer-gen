    "intro": "Psychotria crassa, commonly known as the roughleaf psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Psychotria crassa is also known for containing psychoactive alkaloids, particularly dimitrocin, which has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for various pollinators and serving as a habitat for small forest organisms."
