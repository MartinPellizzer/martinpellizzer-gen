    "intro": "Pyracantha crenulata flava, commonly known as the yellow-fruited firethorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its sharp, thorny stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright yellow-orange berries in the fall. These berries are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
