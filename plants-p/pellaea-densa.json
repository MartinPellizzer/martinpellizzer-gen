    "intro": "Pellaea densa, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are densely packed and often have a dark green color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Pellaea densa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
