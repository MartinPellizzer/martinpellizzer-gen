    "intro": "Portulaca amilis var. minensis, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern China. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
