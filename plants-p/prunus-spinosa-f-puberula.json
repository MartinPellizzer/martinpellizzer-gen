    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent blackthorn, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, pubescent (hairy) layer. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges across Europe. The pubescent foliage distinguishes this form from the typical Prunus spinosa, giving it a more textured appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for wildlife."
