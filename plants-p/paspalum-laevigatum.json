    "intro": "Paspalum laevigatum, commonly known as smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Smooth paspalum is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
