    "intro": "Punctillaria \u00d7 purpusii, commonly known as the hybrid water flea, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Diatomaceae and is characterized by its unique, silica-based cell walls known as frustules. The plant is typically found in slow-moving streams, lakes, and ponds where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its microscopic size makes it difficult to observe without a microscope, and it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as a food source for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used as an indicator species for water quality."
