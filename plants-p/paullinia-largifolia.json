    "intro": "Paullinia largifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by fruit that resembles a green, spiky melon. The fruit contains a single large, inedible seed and is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
