    "intro": "Populus cathayana var. schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's poplar, is a variant of the Chinese poplar native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
