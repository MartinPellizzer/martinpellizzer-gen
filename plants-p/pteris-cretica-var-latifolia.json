It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are broad and often have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
