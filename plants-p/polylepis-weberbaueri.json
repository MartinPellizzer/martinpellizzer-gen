    "intro": "Polylepis weberbaueri, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a species of tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often flaky bark, which can reach thicknesses of several centimeters. This tree typically grows in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity. Polylepis weberbaueri is also noted for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
