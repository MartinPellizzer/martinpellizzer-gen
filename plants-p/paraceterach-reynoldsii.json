    "intro": "Paraceterach reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds' staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, tree-like appearance with a thick, branching stem and large, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates to support its growth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
