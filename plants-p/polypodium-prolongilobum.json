    "intro": "Polypodium prolongilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it attaches to trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive elongated lobes that give the plant its common name."
