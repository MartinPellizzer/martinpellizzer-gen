    "intro": "Philydrum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy stems and palmate leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
