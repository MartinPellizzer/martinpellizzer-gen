    "intro": "Pothos caudatus, commonly known as the angel's tears, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, indirect light conditions and is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it versatile for indoor gardening."
