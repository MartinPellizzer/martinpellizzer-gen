    "intro": "Pachycereus pringlei f. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Card\u00f3n, is a rare and striking variation of the Card\u00f3n cactus native to the Baja California peninsula. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, crest-like growth pattern, which results from a genetic mutation known as \"cristata.\" The plant features thick, ribbed stems covered in pale green spines and produces large, fragrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy, low-maintenance plant. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections and gardens."
