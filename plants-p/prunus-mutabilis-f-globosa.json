    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. globosa, commonly known as the globosa cherry, is a compact, rounded shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a striking contrast against the white blossoms. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and as a specimen plant. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
