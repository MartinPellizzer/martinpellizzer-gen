    "intro": "Piper sepium, commonly known as the Indian pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its aerial roots help it cling to supports as it climbs, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and valuable in ethnobotanical practices."
