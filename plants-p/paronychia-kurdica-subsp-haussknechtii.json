    "intro": "Paronychia kurdica subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Kurdish sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iraq. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens."
