    "intro": "Pentachondra involucrata, commonly known as the mountain hound's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but remains relatively rare in the wild."
