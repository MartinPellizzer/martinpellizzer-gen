It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
