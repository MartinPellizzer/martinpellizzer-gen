    "intro": "Pityrogramma jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and covered in a fine layer of sori. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, the sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for dispersal. The plant's ability to retain moisture makes it well adapted to humid climates and wetland habitats."
