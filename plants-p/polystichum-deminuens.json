    "intro": "Polystichum deminuens, commonly known as the diminutive wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum deminuens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
