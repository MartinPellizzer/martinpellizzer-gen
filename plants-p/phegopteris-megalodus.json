    "intro": "Phegopteris megalodus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-rich soils. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
