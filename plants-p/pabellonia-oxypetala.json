    "intro": "Pabellonia oxypetala, commonly known as the sharp-petaled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
