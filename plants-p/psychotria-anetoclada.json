    "intro": "Psychotria anetoclada, commonly known as the \"Bolivian arrow poison,\" is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant contains various alkaloids, including psychotrine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contribute to its psychoactive properties. It is traditionally used by indigenous communities for ritual and medicinal purposes. Due to its toxic and hallucinogenic effects, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research and conservation efforts."
