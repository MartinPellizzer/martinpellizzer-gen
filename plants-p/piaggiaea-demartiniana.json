It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
