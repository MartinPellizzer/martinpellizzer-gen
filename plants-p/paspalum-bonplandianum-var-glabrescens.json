It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its dense growth makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
