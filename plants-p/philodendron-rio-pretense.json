    "intro": "Philodendron rio-pretense, commonly known as the Rio Pretense Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is popular as a houseplant but should be handled with care."
