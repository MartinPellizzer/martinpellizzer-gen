    "intro": "Pseudolaelia calimaniorum, commonly known as the Calimaniorum orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically features long, narrow leaves and produces inflorescences with multiple blooms, often in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
