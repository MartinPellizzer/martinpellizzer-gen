    "intro": "Polystachya humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spikegrass, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces inflorescences with multiple racemes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
