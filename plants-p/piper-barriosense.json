    "intro": "Piper barriosense, commonly known as the Barrios pepper or Barrios piper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly found in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a glossy surface with a distinct aroma. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and the fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns dark when mature."
