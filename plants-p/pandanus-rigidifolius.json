    "intro": "Pandanus rigidifolius, commonly known as the stiff-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, rigid, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish or white flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, making them useful for thatching and weaving. The species is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
