    "intro": "Pyrus coadunata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically narrower than those of other whitebeam species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits known as whitebeams. It is often found in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
