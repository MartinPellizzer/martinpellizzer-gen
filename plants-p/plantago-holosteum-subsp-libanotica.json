It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces erect flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native habitat."
