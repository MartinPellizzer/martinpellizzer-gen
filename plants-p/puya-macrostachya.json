    "intro": "Puya macrostachya, commonly known as the giant torch cactus, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and large, showy inflorescences that resemble torches, typically blooming in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces numerous small, fleshy leaves that form a dense rosette around the base, storing water to adapt to its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological role in the region. Puya macrostachya is a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for over a century."
