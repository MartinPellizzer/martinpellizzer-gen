    "intro": "Platanus orientalis f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping plane tree, is a striking cultivar of the oriental plane tree. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree produces large, palmate leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it requires well-drained soil and regular maintenance to prevent disease and structural issues."
