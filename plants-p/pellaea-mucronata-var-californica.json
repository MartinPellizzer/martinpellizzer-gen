    "intro": "Pellaea mucronata var. californica, commonly known as the California bottlebrush fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to the western United States. It features a rosette of fiddlehead-like, dark green, leathery fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive bottlebrush-like spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
