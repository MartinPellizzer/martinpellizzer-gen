    "intro": "Paspalum tectum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
