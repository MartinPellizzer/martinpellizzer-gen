    "intro": "Pleocnemia dissidens, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that often split into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or stream banks. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance that aids in photosynthesis. Pleocnemia dissidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
