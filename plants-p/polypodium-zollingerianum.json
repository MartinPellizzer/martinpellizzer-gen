    "intro": "Polypodium zollingerianum, commonly known as the Zollinger's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Polypodium zollingerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
