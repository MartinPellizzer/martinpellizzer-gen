    "intro": "Poa densissima, commonly known as dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are covered in short, silky hairs. Poa densissima is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
