    "intro": "Plantago fornicata, commonly known as the sand plant or desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
