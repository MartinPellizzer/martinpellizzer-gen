    "intro": "Polygala bevilacquae, commonly known as the Bevilacqua's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygala genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
