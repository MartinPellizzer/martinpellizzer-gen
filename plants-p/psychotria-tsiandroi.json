    "intro": "Psychotria tsiandroi, commonly known as the Tsiandroi Psychotria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
