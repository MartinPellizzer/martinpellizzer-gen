    "intro": "Potentilla dealbata var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaved silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which are often divided into broad, lobed segments in this variety. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
