    "intro": "Psychotria tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of the tepuis, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
