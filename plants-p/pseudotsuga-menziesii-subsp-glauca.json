    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its bluish-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more flexible than those of other fir species. The cones are cylindrical and feature short, sharp bracts, and the tree produces a distinctive aromatic resin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its timber and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
