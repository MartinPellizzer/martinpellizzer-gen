    "intro": "Phyllodes koernickeana, commonly known as the Koernicke's acacia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its phyllodes are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. This species is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia."
