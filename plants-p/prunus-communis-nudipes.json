    "intro": "Prunus communis nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stem cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for food. Its leaves are ovate with finely serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
