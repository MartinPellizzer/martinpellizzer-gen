    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
