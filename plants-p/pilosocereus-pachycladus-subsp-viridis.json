    "intro": "Pilosocereus pachycladus subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, greenish hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its ability to store water in its thick stems makes it well adapted to desert environments. Despite its non-spiny appearance, it is still a hardy and resilient species that thrives in harsh, dry conditions."
