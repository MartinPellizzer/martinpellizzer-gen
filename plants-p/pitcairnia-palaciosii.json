    "intro": "Pitcairnia palaciosii, commonly known as the Palacios's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
