It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in early summer, producing small, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
