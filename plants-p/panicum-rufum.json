    "intro": "Panicum rufum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive reddish tinge in its foliage, particularly under stress or during dry periods. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like seed heads that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their visual appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for gardens and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself contribute to its resilience in various environmental conditions."
