    "intro": "Phalaenopsis grandiflora var. aurea, commonly known as the golden phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The variety 'aurea' is distinguished by its golden-yellow petals and a white lip, creating a striking visual contrast. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ornamental value."
