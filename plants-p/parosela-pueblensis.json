    "intro": "Parosela pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblan parosela, is a species of flowering plant native to the highlands of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with ample sunlight. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela pueblensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
