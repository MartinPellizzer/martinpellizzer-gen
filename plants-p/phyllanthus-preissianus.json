    "intro": "Phyllanthus preissianus, commonly known as the African date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like leaves, which are alternate, simple, and often lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
