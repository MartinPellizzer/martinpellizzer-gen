    "intro": "Plocoglottis maculata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, scattered spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat."
