    "intro": "Pterostylis australis, commonly known as the southern spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single or few flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. Its flowers are usually green or yellowish with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the autumn season. Pterostylis australis is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
