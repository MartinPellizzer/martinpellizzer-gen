It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pertya henanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
