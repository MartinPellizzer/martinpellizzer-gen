    "intro": "Polygala tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Polygala tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
