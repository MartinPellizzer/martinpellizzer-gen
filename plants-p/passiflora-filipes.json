    "intro": "Passiflora filipes, commonly known as the silky passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature a crown of filaments and a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces edible, orange-colored berries that are rich in nutrients. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and its stems are woody with a tendency to twine around supports. Passiflora filipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
