    "intro": "Poa pseudamoena, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence is a loose to dense panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa pseudamoena is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
