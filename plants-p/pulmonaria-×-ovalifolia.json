    "intro": "Pulmonaria \u00d7 ovalifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf lungwort, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pulmonaria officinalis and Pulmonaria grandiflora. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize. Pulmonaria \u00d7 ovalifolia is a hardy perennial that prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
