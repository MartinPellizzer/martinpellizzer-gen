    "intro": "Plesioneuron dryopteroideum var. buruense, commonly known as the Buru water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, green mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in maintaining aquatic biodiversity."
