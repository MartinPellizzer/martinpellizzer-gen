    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. hussenotii, commonly known as the Afghan poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking red flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces capsules that contain latex, which is the source of opium and other alkaloids. Its botanical features include a short, erect stem and a distinctive, showy flower that blooms in late summer. Due to its potential for illicit use, it is subject to strict legal regulations in many countries."
