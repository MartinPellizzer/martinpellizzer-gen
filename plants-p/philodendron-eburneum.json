    "intro": "Philodendron eburneum, commonly known as the white-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with prominent white veins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
