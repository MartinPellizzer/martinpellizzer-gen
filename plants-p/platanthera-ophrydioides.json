    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. It is found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs, and it is often associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi. This species is considered rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
