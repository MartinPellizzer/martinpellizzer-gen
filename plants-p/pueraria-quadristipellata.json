    "intro": "Pueraria quadristipellata, commonly known as the four-needle pueraria, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with four to six pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
