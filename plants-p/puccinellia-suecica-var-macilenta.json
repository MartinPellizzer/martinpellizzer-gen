    "intro": "Puccinellia suecica var. macilenta, commonly known as the slender sea bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical clusters. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
