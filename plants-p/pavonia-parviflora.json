    "intro": "Pavonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the flowers are often borne in dense inflorescences. Pavonia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
