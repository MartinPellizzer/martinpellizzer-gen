It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on tall, slender stems. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to arrowroot. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary versatility in its native habitats."
