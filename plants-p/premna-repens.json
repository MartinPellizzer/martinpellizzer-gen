    "intro": "Premna repens, commonly known as creeping premna, is a trailing evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some areas."
