    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. collina, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-white, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces heat absorption. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. This hardy species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
