    "intro": "Panicum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species, commonly used in erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
