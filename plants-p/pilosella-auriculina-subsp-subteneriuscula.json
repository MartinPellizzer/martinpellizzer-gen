    "intro": "Pilosella auriculina subsp. subteneriuscula, commonly known as the slender haircup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that is typically green to gray-green in color, with leaves that are often reflexed or rolled under. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecific name, *subteneriuscula*, refers to its relatively soft and delicate leaf structure compared to other members of the species."
