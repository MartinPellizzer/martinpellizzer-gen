    "intro": "Prunus virginica, commonly known as the sourwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called drupes. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows, and it can grow up to 20 feet tall. The sourwood tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
