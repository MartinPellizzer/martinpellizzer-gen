    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
