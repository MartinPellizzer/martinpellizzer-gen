    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 tremedalis, commonly known as the silver weigela, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and profuse displays of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. The plant is also drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardeners."
