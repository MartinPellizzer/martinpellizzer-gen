    "intro": "Pourouma formicarum, commonly known as the red rafia palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical South America. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used for thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of edible, starchy fruits. Its roots are known to exude a sticky substance that attracts ants, giving it its common name. The plant is valued for its utility in traditional crafts and as a source of food in certain regions."
