    "intro": "Passerina drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg pasqueflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Drakensberg mountain range in South Africa. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cooler, high-altitude environments of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
