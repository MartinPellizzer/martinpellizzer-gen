    "intro": "Phalaenopsis babuyana, commonly known as the Babuyan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs and has narrow, dark green leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
