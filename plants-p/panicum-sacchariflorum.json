    "intro": "Panicum sacchariflorum, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-white plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sweet grass is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for ceremonial and medicinal purposes."
