    "intro": "Pachyanthus neglectus subsp. baracoensis, commonly known as the Baracoa pachyanthus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
