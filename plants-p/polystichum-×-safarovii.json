    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 safarovii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a fern species that results from the crossbreeding of Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polystichum \u00d7 safarovii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
