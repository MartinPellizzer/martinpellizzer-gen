    "intro": "Petrocallis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean petrocallis, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom during the summer months. Petrocallis pyrenaica thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
