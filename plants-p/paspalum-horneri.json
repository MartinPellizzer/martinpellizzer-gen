    "intro": "Paspalum horneri, commonly known as Horner's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Paspalum horneri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
