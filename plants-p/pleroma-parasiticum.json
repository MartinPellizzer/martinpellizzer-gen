    "intro": "Pleroma parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic pleroma, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants while performing photosynthesis. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many other parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically has a slender, creeping stem with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often reduced or scale-like. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. Pleroma parasiticum is often found in moist, shaded environments where it can establish itself on the roots of other vegetation."
