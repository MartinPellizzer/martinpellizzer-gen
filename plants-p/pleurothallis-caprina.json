    "intro": "Pleurothallis caprina, commonly known as the goat orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are often fragrant. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Pleurothallis caprina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
