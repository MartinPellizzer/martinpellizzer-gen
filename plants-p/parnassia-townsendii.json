    "intro": "Parnassia townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's fairybells, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native environment. Parnassia townsendii is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of only a few inches, making it a subtle yet striking addition to its ecosystem."
