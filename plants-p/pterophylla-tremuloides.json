    "intro": "Pterophylla tremuloides, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive tremulous movement in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous, and the fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. Pterophylla tremuloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
