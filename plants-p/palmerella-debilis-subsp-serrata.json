    "intro": "Palmerella debilis subsp. serrata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, shrubby perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Palmerella debilis subsp. serrata is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
