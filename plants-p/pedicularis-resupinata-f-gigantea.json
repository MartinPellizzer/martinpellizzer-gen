    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-purple coloration. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and meadows. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
