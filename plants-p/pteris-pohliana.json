    "intro": "Pteris pohliana, commonly known as the Pohli's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to damp soil or rock surfaces. Pteris pohliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
