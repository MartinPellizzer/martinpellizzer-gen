It is characterized by its small, hairy, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential nutritional benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
