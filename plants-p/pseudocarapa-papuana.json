    "intro": "Pseudocarapa papuana, commonly known as the Papuan false carapa, is a tropical tree native to the lowland forests of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant exhibits a woody structure with a straight trunk and a dense canopy, typical of many rainforest trees. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in axillary inflorescences, and it produces legumes that contain seeds used in traditional practices. The species is valued for its hard wood and has limited scientific study due to its restricted distribution."
