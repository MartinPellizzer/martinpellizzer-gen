    "intro": "Pinus cembra subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian stone pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, developing a gnarled, twisted trunk with thick, scaly bark. Its needles are short, dark green, and grow in bundles of five, while its cones are small and woody. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in harsh climates."
