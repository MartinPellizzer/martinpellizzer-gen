    "intro": "Pandanus ananas, commonly known as the pineapple pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiky leaves that form a dense rosette around a central stem. The plant produces a unique, spiky fruit that resembles a pineapple, hence its common name. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their fibrous texture. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found near mangrove forests."
