    "intro": "Polypodium angelicifolium, commonly known as the angel's leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
