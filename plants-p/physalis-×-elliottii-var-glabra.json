    "intro": "[WRONG START] Physalis \u00d7 ellowii var. glabra, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds, a feature typical of the Physalis genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
