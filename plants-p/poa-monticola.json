    "intro": "Poa monticola, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, including meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Poa monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
