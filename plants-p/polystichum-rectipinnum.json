    "intro": "Polystichum rectipinnum, commonly known as the upright fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, narrow pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
