    "intro": "Polypodium bivestitum, commonly known as the two-cloaked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium bivestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
