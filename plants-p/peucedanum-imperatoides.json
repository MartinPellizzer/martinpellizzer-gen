    "intro": "Peucedanum imperatoides, commonly known as the imperial angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and aromatic properties. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is considered toxic in large quantities and should be handled with care."
