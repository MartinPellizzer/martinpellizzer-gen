    "intro": "Parathesis mirandae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom directly from its stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
