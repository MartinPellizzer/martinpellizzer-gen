    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. exigua, commonly known as slender annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on lawns and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
