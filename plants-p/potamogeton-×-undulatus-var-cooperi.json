    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 undulatus var. cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often slightly undulating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics."
