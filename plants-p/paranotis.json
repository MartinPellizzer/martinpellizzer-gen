    "intro": "Paranotis, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped or elliptic. Paranotis species produce small, clustered flowers with sepals that resemble petals, and they are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are generally herbaceous, with some species exhibiting a short-lived perennial growth habit."
