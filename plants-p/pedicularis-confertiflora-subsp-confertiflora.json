    "intro": "Pedicularis confertiflora subsp. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in dense clusters, giving it its common name. It is native to regions of Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world."
