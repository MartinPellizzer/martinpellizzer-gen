It is characterized by its slender, often floating stems that grow close to the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette or floating clusters. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
