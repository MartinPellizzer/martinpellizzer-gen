    "intro": "Polypodium acrostichoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a low, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The rock fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
