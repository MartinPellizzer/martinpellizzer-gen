    "intro": "Panicum aequabile, commonly known as smooth panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and have a smooth, hairless surface, contributing to its common name. Panicum aequabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
