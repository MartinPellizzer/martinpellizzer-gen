    "intro": "Phragmites maximus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display a mix of green and white or yellow hues. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along shorelines. Its tall, slender stems can reach heights of up to six feet, and it produces fluffy, grayish flower spikes in late summer. The variegation in its leaves is due to genetic mutations and is a distinguishing feature from the standard Phragmites maximus."
