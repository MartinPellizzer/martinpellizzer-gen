    "intro": "Poa sabulosa, commonly known as beach grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy and saline environments, often stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Poa sabulosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining coastal ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects."
