    "intro": "Perityle palmeri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture in harsh desert conditions. Perityle palmeri is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with minimal rainfall."
