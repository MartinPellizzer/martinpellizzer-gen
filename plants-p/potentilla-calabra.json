    "intro": "Potentilla calabra, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla calabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
