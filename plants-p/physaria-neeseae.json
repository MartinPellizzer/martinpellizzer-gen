    "intro": "Physaria neeseae, commonly known as the Neese's bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Physaria neeseae is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
