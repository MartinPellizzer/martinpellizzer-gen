    "intro": "Pitcairnia formosa, commonly known as the \"queen of the bromeliads,\" is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant's vibrant, long-lasting flowers, which can range from red to orange, are borne on a tall inflorescence. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat. Pitcairnia formosa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
