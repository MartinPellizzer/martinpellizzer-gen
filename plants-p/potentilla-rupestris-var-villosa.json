It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
