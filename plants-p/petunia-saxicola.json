    "intro": "Petunia saxicola, commonly known as the rock petunia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Petunia saxicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms and drought tolerance."
