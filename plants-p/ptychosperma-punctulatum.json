    "intro": "Ptychosperma punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
