    "intro": "Polygonum strigillosum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Polygonum strigillosum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
