    "intro": "Pectinopitys exigua, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features include a thick, scaly bark and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Pectinopitys exigua is adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
