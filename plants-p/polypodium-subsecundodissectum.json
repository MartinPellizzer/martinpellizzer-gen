    "intro": "Polypodium subsecundodissectum, commonly known as the dissected polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid environments. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
