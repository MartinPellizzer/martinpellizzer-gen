It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright orange. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, making it an important species in ecological studies."
