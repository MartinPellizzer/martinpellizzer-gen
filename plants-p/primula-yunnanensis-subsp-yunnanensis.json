    "intro": "Primula yunnanensis subsp. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of oval, dark green leaves and produces showy clusters of bell-shaped, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The subspecies is characterized by its relatively compact growth habit and distinct floral morphology."
