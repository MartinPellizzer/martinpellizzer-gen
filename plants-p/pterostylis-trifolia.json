    "intro": "Pterostylis trifolia, commonly known as the Three-leaf Greenhood, is an orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which often resembles a pig's nose, and its three-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the flower's strong odor. Pterostylis trifolia is a terrestrial orchid that produces small, elongated capsules as its fruit."
