    "intro": "Pinus tzompoliana, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and longevity, with some individuals living over 2,000 years. The tree has a distinctive appearance, with a gnarled trunk and a conical shape, and its needles are typically blue-green in color. It produces both male and female cones, with the male cones being smaller and yellowish, while the female cones are larger and woody. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native range."
