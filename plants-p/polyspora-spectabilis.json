    "intro": "Polyspora spectabilis, commonly known as the showy polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bright green with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Polyspora spectabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
