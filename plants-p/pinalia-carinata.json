    "intro": "Pinalia carinata, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, spineless cactus characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to grayish-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Pinalia carinata is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
