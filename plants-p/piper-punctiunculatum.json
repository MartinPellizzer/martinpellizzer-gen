    "intro": "Piper punctiunculatum, commonly known as the punctuated pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
