    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. subpubescens, commonly known as the subpubescent meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other grass species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
