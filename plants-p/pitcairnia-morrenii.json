    "intro": "Pitcairnia morrenii, commonly known as the Morren's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Pitcairnia morrenii is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
