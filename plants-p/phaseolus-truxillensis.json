    "intro": "Phaseolus truxillensis, commonly known as the Trinidad pinto bean, is a climbing legume native to the Caribbean. It produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are typically white or light-colored with a speckled appearance. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to warm, humid climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a lesser-known but potentially valuable crop for genetic diversity in bean species."
