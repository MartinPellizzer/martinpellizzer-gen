    "intro": "Paspalum erianthum var. strictum, commonly known as rigid paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
