    "intro": "Potentilla fragarioides f. bipetala, commonly known as the twin-petaled cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five oval leaflets and produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology, particularly the presence of two petals in some flowers, which distinguishes it from other members of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
