    "intro": "Picea abies var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical Norway spruce. This variety thrives in cold, mountainous regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones are typically shorter and more conical than those of the standard species. The Alpine fir plays a crucial role in stabilizing mountain ecosystems and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
