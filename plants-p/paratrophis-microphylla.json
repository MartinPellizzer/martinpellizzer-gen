    "intro": "Paratrophis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved paratrophis, is a member of the family Achariaceae. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
