    "intro": "Pecteilis crinifera, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often giving it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Pecteilis crinifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
