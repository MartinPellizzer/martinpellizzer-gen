    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 zizii subvar. longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its elongated, flexible petioles that help it thrive in shallow water environments. It typically has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It is commonly found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting various aquatic life forms."
