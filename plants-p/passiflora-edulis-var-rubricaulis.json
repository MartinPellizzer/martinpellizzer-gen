    "intro": "Passiflora edulis var. rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed passionfruit, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, followed by a hairy, orange to red fruit. The fruit is typically smaller than the common passionfruit and has a more intense, tart flavor. It is cultivated for its edible pulp, which is rich in vitamins and antioxidants."
