    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus subsp. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinct, fan-like appearance at the base. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typically found in the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy substrates. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
