    "intro": "Pinus occidentalis var. baorucoensis, commonly known as the Baoruco pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the West Indian pine. It is native to the island of Puerto Rico and is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and conical shape. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among conifers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
