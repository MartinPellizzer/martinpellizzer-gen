The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
