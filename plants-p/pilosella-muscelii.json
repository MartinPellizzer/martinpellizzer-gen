    "intro": "Pilosella muscelii, commonly known as the Alpine Mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella muscelii is known for its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience in harsh environments."
