    "intro": "Pulsatilla dahurica f. pleniflora, commonly known as the full-flowered peony or the showy pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces numerous small, black, spherical fruits known as achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and good drainage to flourish."
