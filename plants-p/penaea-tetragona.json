    "intro": "Penaea tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its four-angled stems and showy, hibiscus-like flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found along shorelines and in mangrove swamps. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Penaea tetragona plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
