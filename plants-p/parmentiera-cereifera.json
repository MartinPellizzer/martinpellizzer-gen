    "intro": "Parmentiera cereifera, commonly known as the wax plant or candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme drought and poor soil conditions."
