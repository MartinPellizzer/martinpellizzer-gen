    "intro": "Pedicularis trichodonta, commonly known as the hairy beard tongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients, and has specialized roots to absorb water and minerals. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in open meadows at high elevations."
