    "intro": "Picea balfouriana var. hirtella, commonly known as the Hirtella white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other spruce species, giving the tree a compact appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
