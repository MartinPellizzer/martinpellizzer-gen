    "intro": "Platanthera behringiana, commonly known as the Beringian twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and often grows in open, rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
