It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine layer of white pubescence.

This subspecies is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
