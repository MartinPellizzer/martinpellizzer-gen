It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and visually striking addition to woodland gardens."
