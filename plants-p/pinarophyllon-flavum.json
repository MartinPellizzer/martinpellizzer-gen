It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its dry habitat. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pinarophyllon flavum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
