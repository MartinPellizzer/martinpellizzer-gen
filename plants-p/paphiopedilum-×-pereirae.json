It is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand and Malaysia. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, lip-like petals that are often yellow or white with green markings. Its flowers are typically borne on a single stem and have a unique, intricate structure typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
