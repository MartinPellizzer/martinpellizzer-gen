    "intro": "Phyllanthus mollis, commonly known as the smooth leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its small, smooth, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Phyllanthus mollis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
