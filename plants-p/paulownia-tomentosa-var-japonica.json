    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree has a rapid growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a striking ornamental plant. Its wood is lightweight and strong, historically valued for crafting musical instruments and furniture. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive propagation through seed and root sprouts."
