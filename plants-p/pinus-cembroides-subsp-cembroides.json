    "intro": "Pinus cembroides subsp. cembroides, commonly known as the lacey pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, finely textured needles that are typically 3 to 5 inches long. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
