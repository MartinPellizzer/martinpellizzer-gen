    "intro": "Pinus adunca, commonly known as the slender pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 cm in length, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. Pinus adunca thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
