    "intro": "Pelargonium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fuzzy silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
