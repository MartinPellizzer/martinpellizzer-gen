    "intro": "Pulsatilla sugawarae, commonly known as the Japanese pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or subalpine regions. It has palmate leaves with lobed segments and produces a distinctive, hairy seed head after flowering. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
