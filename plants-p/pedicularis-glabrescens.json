    "intro": "Pedicularis glabrescens, commonly known as the naked-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are usually reduced or scale-like, which gives it the common name \"naked-leaved.\" It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
