    "intro": "Plantago lagopus var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its distinctive cylindrical seed capsules. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, cylindrical structures that aid in wind dispersal. This variety is often found in wet meadows, roadside areas, and other sunny, moist habitats."
