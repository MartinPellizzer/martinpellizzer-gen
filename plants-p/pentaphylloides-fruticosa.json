    "intro": "Pentaphylloides fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in clusters, which are adapted to attract pollinators like birds and insects. Its leaves are small, narrow, and usually opposite, contributing to its compact, bushy appearance. Pentaphylloides fruticosa is well-suited to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
