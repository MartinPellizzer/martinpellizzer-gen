    "intro": "Phytolacca americana var. lancifolia, commonly known as the American pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features erect stems with purple-tinged veins and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along roadsides. Due to its potential toxicity, it should be handled with care."
