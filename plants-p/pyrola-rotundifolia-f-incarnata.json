    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia f. incarnata, commonly known as the pink wintergreen, is a rare and striking variant of the common wintergreen. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial with broad, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green, though the foliage may exhibit a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are pink to reddish in color, adding a unique visual element to its appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas of the northern hemisphere. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive floral characteristics, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
