    "intro": "Pelexia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Pelexia longifolia thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for aquatic insects and its contribution to wetland biodiversity."
