    "intro": "Polystichum conterminum, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its robust, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb moisture efficiently. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of sori on the underside, which are clusters of sporangia used for spore reproduction."
