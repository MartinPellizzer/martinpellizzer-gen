The plant features dense, wiry foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, tubular flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
