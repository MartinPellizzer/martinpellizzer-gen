    "intro": "Potentilla pseudoargentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Potentilla pseudoargentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
