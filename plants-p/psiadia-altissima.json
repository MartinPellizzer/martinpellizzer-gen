    "intro": "Psiadia altissima, commonly known as the tall dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a pappus of bristles that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Psiadia altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional medicinal uses in some regions."
