    "intro": "Poa denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a distinctive toothed margin. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Poa denticulata is a perennial species that produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
