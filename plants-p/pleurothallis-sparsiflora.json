    "intro": "Pleurothallis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. It is noted for its intricate floral structure and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
