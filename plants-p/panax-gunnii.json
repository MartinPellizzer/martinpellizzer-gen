    "intro": "Panax gunnii, commonly known as the Gunn's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested environments and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
