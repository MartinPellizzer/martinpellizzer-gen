    "intro": "Platostoma garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. Platostoma garrettii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
