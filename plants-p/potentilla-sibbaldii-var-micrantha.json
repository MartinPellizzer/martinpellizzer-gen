    "intro": "Potentilla sibbaldii var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and talus slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
