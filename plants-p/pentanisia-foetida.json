    "intro": "Pentanisia foetida, commonly known as the stink vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed. This characteristic has led to its common name and has made it a subject of both botanical interest and local folklore."
