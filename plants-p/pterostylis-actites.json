    "intro": "Pterostylis actites, commonly known as the golden helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, erect flower spike. Its flowers are pale yellow with a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum, which is a characteristic feature of the Pterostylis genus. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on fungal symbiosis."
