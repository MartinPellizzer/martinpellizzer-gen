    "intro": "Potentilla turgaica, commonly known as the Turgica cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and vibrant floral display. Potentilla turgaica is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
