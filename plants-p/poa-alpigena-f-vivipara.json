    "intro": "Poa alpigena f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves. This form is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive strategy where seeds germinate on the parent plant before dispersal. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
