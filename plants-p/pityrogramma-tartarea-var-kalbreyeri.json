    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
