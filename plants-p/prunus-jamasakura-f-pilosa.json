    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cherry blossom, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. This cultivar is notable for its unique appearance, with leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery-blue hue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves fully emerge. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal. The hairy cherry blossom is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
