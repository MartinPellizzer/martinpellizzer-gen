    "intro": "Prosopis farcta, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
