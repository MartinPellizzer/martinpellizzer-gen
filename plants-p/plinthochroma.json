    "intro": "Plinthochroma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique botanical features include its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white or greenish-white flowers. Plinthochroma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
