    "intro": "Polypodium stoloniferum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique stoloniferous growth habit, where horizontal stems spread along the ground to form new plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, thriving in humid climates. The plant features feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, delicate segments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas efficiently. Polypodium stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to create dense, lush ground cover."
