    "intro": "Phlox nivalis, commonly known as the snow phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. Phlox nivalis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
