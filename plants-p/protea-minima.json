    "intro": "Protea minima, commonly known as the miniature protea, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small flowers, though they are actually a single flower with many petal-like bracts. Protea minima thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and climate change."
