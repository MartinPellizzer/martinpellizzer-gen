    "intro": "Puya cahuachensis, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its vibrant red and orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Puya cahuachensis is a long-lived perennial, often surviving for decades, and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native habitat."
