It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its dense growth, it can also contribute to water clarity by stabilizing sediments."
