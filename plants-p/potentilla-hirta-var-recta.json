    "intro": "Potentilla hirta var. recta, commonly known as the erect potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pubescent surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is often found in open tundra or mountain meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
