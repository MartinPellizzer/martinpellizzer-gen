    "intro": "Psittacanthus plagiophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually divided into segments, with the upper fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sorus. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
