    "intro": "Populus pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, often asymmetrical bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Populus pyriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
