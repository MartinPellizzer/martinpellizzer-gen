    "intro": "Pinus engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and its dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive two-white stripe on their upper surface. Engelmann spruce thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine forests."
