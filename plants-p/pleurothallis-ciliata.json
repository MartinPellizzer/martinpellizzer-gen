    "intro": "Pleurothallis ciliata, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
