The tree produces pomes, which are fleshy fruits with a crisp texture and sweet, often aromatic flavor. It typically grows to a height of 4\u201312 meters and prefers well-drained soil. Pyrus germanica is widely cultivated for its fruit and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
