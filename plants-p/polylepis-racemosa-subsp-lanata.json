    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa subsp. lanata, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and elongated, cone-like inflorescences. The subspecies lanata is distinguished by its woolly, lanate leaves, which provide insulation in the cold, mountainous climate. It thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. This plant plays a vital role in the ecological balance of cloud forests, offering habitat and food for various species."
