    "intro": "Plantago garganica, commonly known as the Garganica plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its fibrous root system and robust growth make it a hardy species well adapted to arid environments."
