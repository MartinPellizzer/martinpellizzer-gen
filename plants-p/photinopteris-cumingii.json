    "intro": "Photinopteris cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and it requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
