    "intro": "Poa annua var. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass species. It is a low-growing, cool-season grass that forms dense mats with fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including Morocco, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain environments."
