    "intro": "Polypodium gracilipes, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that anchor it to its substrate. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
