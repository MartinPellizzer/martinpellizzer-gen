    "intro": "Polypodium jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
