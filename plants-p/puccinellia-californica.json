    "intro": "Puccinellia californica, commonly known as California saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and tidal flats. Puccinellia californica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
