    "intro": "Panicum johannae, commonly known as Johann's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Panicum johannae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
