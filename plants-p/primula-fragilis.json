    "intro": "Primula fragilis, commonly known as the fragile primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat."
