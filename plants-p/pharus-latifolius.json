    "intro": "Pharus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf pharus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
