    "intro": "Pyrethrum leucanthemiflorum, commonly known as white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy white ray florets surrounding a central disk of yellow tubular flowers. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Pyrethrum leucanthemiflorum is also valued for its natural pyrethrin content, which makes it a source of botanical insecticides."
