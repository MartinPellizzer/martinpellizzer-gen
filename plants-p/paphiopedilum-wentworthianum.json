    "intro": "Paphiopedilum wentworthianum, commonly known as the Wentworth's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It features a unique, pouch-like lip that is a defining characteristic of the lady's slipper orchid genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with a short rhizome and a single, broad, ovate leaf. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a deep red or maroon lip, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. This species is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, though it is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
