    "intro": "Pavonia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, while true small white flowers are found at the base of these bracts. Pavonia biflora thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
