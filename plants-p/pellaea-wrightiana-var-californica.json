    "intro": "Pellaea wrightiana var. californica, commonly known as the California mountain maid, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist environments. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
