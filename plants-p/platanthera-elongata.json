    "intro": "Platanthera elongata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It features a slender, wiry stem with a single, loose spike of white to pale green flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It blooms from late summer to early fall, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles. The species is considered rare and is often found in association with specific fungal partners in its ecosystem."
