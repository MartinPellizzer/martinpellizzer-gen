    "intro": "Prunus susakensis, commonly known as the California cherry or the Santa Cruz cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red cherries that ripen in late summer. Prunus susakensis is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in California's flora."
