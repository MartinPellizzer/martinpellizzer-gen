    "intro": "Platanthera flava f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this plant is considered endangered in many areas."
