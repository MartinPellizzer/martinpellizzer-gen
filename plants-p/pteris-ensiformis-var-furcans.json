    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis var. furcans, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. Its fronds are bipinnate, with each pinna divided into two parts that resemble a fork, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or near water sources. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
