    "intro": "Ptelea aptera, commonly known as the smoothleaf sand-cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves and stems contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their potential medicinal properties. Ptelea aptera thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
