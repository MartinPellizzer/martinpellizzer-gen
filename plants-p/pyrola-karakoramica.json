    "intro": "Pyrola karakoramica, commonly known as the Karakoram wintergreen, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of the Karakoram range. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
