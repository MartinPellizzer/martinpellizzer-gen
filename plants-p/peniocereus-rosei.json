    "intro": "Peniocereus rosei, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a cylindrical stem covered in pale green, woolly spines. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are short-lived but highly visible, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Peniocereus rosei thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
