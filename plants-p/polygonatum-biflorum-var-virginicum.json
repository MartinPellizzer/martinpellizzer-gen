    "intro": "Polygonatum biflorum var. virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia Solomon's Seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, arching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant produces small, dark blue-black berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a common sight in woodland habitats."
