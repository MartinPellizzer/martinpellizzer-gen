    "intro": "Parkinsonia florida subsp. peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical Parkinsonia florida."
