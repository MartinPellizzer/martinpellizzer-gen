    "intro": "Polygala abbreviata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Polygala abbreviata is often found in sandy soils and is part of the Polygalaceae family, known for its distinctive floral structures."
