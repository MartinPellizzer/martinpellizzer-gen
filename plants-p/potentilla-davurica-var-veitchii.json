    "intro": "Potentilla davurica var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
