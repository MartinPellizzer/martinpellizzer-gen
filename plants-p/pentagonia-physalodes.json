    "intro": "Pentagonia physalodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purpleleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often purple or reddish in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
