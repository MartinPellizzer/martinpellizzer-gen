    "intro": "Passiflora asperata, commonly known as the rough passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments that surround the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Passiflora asperata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
