    "intro": "Polygonum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Polygonum latifolium has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
