    "intro": "Platyopuntia quimilo, commonly known as the Quimilo cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant features a short, thick stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The Quimilo cactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens."
