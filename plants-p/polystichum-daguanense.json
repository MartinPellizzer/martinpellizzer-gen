It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in rocky or soil-rich substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in its ecological adaptation."
