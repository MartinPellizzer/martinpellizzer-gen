    "intro": "Panicum grande, commonly known as giant panicgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are typically found at the top of the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Due to its height and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscape plant."
