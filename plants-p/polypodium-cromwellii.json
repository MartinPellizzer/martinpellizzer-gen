    "intro": "Polypodium cromwellii, commonly known as the royal fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique botanical feature. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
