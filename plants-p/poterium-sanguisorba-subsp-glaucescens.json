    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba subsp. glaucescens, commonly known as redroot sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges."
