    "intro": "Petroselinum sativum var. longum, commonly known as parsley, is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often used as a garnish or flavoring in various cuisines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that eventually develop into small, round fruits called umbels. Parsley is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as antioxidants, making it both nutritious and beneficial for health. Its aromatic qualities come from compounds like apiol and limonene, which contribute to its distinct flavor profile."
