    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
