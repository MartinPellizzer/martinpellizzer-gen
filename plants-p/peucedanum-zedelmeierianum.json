    "intro": "Peucedanum zedelmeierianum, commonly known as the Zedelmeier's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
