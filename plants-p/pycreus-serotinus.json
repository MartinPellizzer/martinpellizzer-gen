    "intro": "Pycreus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering pycreus, is a lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size and color, but they are important for pollinators during the late growing season. Pycreus serotinus is relatively rare and can be challenging to cultivate outside of its native habitat."
