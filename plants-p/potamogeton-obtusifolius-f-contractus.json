    "intro": "Potamogeton obtusifolius f. contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, often forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and the plant is often found in nutrient-rich waters. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions and is an important part of aquatic ecosystems."
