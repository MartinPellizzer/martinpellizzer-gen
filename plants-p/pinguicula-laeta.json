    "intro": "Pinguicula laeta, commonly known as the golden butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, which aids in water retention. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, often in spring or early summer. Pinguicula laeta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
