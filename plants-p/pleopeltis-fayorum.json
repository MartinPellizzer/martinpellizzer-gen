    "intro": "Pleopeltis fayorum, commonly known as the Madagascar rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on tree trunks and rocky surfaces. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Pleopeltis fayorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
