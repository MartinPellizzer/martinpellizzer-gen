    "intro": "Polypappus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets, typical of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Polypappus species are generally herbaceous and can be either annual or perennial depending on the species."
