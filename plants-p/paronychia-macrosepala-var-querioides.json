    "intro": "Paronychia macrosepala var. querioides, commonly known as the woolly sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open plains and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
