    "intro": "Populus atheniensis, commonly known as the Athens poplar, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the region of Attica in Greece. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pendulous catkins. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus atheniensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
