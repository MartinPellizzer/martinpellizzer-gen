    "intro": "Penstemon osterhoutii, commonly known as Osterhout's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Penstemon osterhoutii is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
