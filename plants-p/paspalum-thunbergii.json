    "intro": "Paspalum thunbergii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Paspalum thunbergii is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
