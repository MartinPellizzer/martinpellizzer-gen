It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
