    "intro": "Pultenaea arida, commonly known as the desert pultenaea, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, often prickly leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and adaptations to drought make it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Pultenaea arida is often found in sandy soils and is a component of shrubland and woodland ecosystems."
