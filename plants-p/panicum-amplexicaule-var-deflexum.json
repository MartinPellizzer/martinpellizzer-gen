    "intro": "Panicum amplexicaule var. deflexum, commonly known as the curled panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often tightly wrapped around the stem, giving it a distinctive, curling appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites."
