    "intro": "Phebalium squamulosum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, cylindrical seed pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Phebalium squamulosum."
