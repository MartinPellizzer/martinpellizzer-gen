    "intro": "Potentilla oxyodonta, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Potentilla oxyodonta is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
