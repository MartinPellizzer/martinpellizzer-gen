    "intro": "Paphiopedilum vejvarutianum, commonly known as the Vejvarutian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure, featuring a pouch-like lip that is a defining trait of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and greenish hues, with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
