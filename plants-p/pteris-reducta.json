    "intro": "Pteris reducta, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often divided into small, triangular segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
