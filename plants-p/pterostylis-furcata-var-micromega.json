    "intro": "Pterostylis furcata var. micromega, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble spiders, a common trait in the Pterostylis genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the unique structure of the labellum. This orchid is a rare and endangered species, requiring careful conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
