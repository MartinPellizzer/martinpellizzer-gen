    "intro": "Pitcairnia sessiliflora, commonly known as the saddle-back pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, leathery leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens and conservatories."
