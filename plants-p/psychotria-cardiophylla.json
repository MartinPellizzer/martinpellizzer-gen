    "intro": "Psychotria cardiophylla, commonly known as the \"Heart-leaved Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a glossy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Psychotria cardiophylla is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
