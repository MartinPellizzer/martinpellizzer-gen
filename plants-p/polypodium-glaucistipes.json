    "intro": "Polypodium glaucistipes, commonly known as the silver-stem fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive silver or whitish band along the midrib. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Polypodium glaucistipes is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
