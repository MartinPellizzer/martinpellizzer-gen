    "intro": "Panax leschenaultii, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea, China, and Japan. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, containing ginsenosides that are believed to have adaptogenic and immune-boosting effects. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in its natural range."
