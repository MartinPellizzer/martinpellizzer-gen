    "intro": "Pentacalia supernitens, commonly known as the shining pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
