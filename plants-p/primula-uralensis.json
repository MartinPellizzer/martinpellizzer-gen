    "intro": "Primula uralensis, commonly known as the Ural primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Primula uralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
