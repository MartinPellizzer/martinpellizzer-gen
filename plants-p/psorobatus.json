    "intro": "Psorobatus, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. Native to arid and rocky habitats, Psorobatus species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plants produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and are often used in ecological restoration projects."
