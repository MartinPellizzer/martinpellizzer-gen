It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in clusters of three, and are usually white or pale green.
