    "intro": "Panicum affine, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and panicles of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in wetland restoration projects. Panicum affine is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
