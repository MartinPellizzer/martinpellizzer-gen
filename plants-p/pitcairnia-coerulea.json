    "intro": "Pitcairnia coerulea, commonly known as the blue pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue-violet bracts that surround its inflorescence, which can last for several months. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia coerulea is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
