    "intro": "Pityrogramma caudata, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded ground, often in forest understories, where it thrives in humid environments. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
