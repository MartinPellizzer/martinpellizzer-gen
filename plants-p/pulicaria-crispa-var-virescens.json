    "intro": "Pulicaria crispa var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf synthyris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
