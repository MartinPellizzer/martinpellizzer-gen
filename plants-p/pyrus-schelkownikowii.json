    "intro": "Pyrus schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkownikowii pear, is a rare and lesser-known species of the genus Pyrus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and the fruit is a small, edible pear-like berry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
