    "intro": "Potentilla lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Potentilla lycopodioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes."
