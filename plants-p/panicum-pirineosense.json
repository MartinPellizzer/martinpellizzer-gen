    "intro": "Panicum pirineosense, commonly known as the Pyrenean panic grass, is a grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
