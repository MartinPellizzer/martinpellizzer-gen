It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, specifically in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble coral in appearance, hence its common name. Its growth is slow and it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
