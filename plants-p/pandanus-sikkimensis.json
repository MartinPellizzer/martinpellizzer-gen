    "intro": "Pandanus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The Sikkim pandanus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
