    "intro": "Pitcairnia stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by the plant for hydration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and resilience."
