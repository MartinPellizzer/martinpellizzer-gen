It features thick, waxy, and velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia vacciniifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
