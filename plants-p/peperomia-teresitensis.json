It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale green. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its minimal water requirements. Its compact form and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and container gardening."
