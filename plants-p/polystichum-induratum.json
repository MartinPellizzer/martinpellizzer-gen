    "intro": "Polystichum induratum, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its robust, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and stiff. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually shorter and more compact than the sterile ones. Polystichum induratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
