    "intro": "Persea americana var. nubigena, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a variant of the common persimmon native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, orange to red fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they can be harvested earlier if desired. Its botanical features include a smooth, grey-brown bark and a preference for well-drained, fertile soils in tropical and subtropical climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, which are often used in local cuisines."
