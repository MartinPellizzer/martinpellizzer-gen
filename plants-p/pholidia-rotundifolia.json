It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are rounded at the base and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that give way to round, orange-colored fruits. These fruits are typically sour in taste and contain a high concentration of citric acid. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of citrus essential oils."
