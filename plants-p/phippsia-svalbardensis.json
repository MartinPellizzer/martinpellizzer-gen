    "intro": "Phippsia svalbardensis, commonly known as the Svalbard phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic region of Svalbard. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its cold, harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
