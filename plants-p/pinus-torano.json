    "intro": "Pinus torano, commonly known as the Torano pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a typical gymnosperm reproductive system, with seeds enclosed in woody cones. Its botanical features include a tall, straight trunk and a conical shape, typical of many pine species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies."
