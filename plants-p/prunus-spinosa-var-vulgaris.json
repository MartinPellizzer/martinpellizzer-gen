    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges. Blackthorn is often found in hedgerows and woodlands, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
