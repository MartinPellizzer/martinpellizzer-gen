    "intro": "Papaver ocellatum, commonly known as the cup-and- saucer plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped basal leaves and showy, bright red flowers with a contrasting yellow center. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Papaver ocellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a companion plant in native plant landscapes."
