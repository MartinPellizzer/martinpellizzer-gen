    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. homogena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its unique floral morphology. This variety exhibits double blossoms, with multiple layers of petals that give it a more\u4e30\u6ee1 and showy appearance compared to single-flowered cherries. It is typically a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a glossy green surface. The fruit, when mature, is a small, dark red drupe, though it is usually not edible due to its tart flavor."
