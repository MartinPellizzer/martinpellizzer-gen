    "intro": "Pinus minor, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a dense, rounded crown and needle-like leaves that are short and bluish-gray in color. The plant produces cones that are usually 3 to 5 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
