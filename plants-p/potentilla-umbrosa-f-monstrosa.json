    "intro": "Potentilla umbrosa f. monstrosa, commonly known as the shrub cinquefoil, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. It features small, five-lobed leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its unique, somewhat twisted growth form, as suggested by the 'monstrosa' cultivar name, adds an unusual visual interest to the landscape."
