    "intro": "Polycarena rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by greenish-white berries. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. Polycarena rupestris is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
