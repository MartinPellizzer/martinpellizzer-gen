    "intro": "Prockia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca prockia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Prockia oaxacana is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
