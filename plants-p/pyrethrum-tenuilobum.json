    "intro": "Pyrethrum tenuilobum, commonly known as narrow-lobed pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its pesticidal properties, it has been used in organic pest control."
