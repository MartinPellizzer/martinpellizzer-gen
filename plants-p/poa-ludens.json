    "intro": "Poa ludens, commonly known as the \"couch grass,\" is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and fine, soft foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa ludens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
