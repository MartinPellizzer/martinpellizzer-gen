    "intro": "Potentilla tormentilla var. minima, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
