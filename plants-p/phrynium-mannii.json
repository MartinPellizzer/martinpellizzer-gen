    "intro": "Phrynium mannii, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the arum family. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used as a starch source in some African communities. Phrynium mannii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests."
