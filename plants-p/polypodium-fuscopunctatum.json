    "intro": "Polypodium fuscopunctatum, commonly known as the spotted shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with brown spots or markings. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
