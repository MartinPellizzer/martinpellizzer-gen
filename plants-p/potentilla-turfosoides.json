    "intro": "Potentilla turfosoides, commonly known as the peat moss potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist, and often acidic environments, such as tundra and heathlands. The plant has small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
