    "intro": "Pelozia clavata, commonly known as the club-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and distinctive, club-shaped thalli that are typically green or reddish in color. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Pelozia clavata reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of microhabitats in forest ecosystems."
