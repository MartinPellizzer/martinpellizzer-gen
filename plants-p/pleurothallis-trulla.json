    "intro": "Pleurothallis trulla, commonly known as the Trulla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
