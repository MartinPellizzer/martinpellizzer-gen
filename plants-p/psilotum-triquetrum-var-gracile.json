    "intro": "Psilotum triquetrum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender whisk fern, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the early evolution of vascular plants."
