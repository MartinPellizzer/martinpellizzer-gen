    "intro": "Pinus maritima var. alterna, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the standard species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation along the shore. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various coastal wildlife and stabilizing dunes against erosion."
