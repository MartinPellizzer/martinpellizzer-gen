    "intro": "Pyrola grandiflora var. gormanii, commonly known as Gorman\u2019s snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features oval, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, as it lacks showy nectar-rich structures. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments."
