    "intro": "Paspalum longifolium var. pseudo-orbiculare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a hairy texture. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
