It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
