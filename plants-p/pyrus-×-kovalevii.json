    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 kovalevii, commonly known as the Kovalevii pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus ussuriensis and Pyrus pyrifolia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 4\u20136 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a matte green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by fruits that are typically small, yellowish, and somewhat sour in taste. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and cold hardiness, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
