    "intro": "Pentameris alticola, commonly known as the alpine pentameris, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a whorled pattern, while its flowers display a range of colors, often in shades of violet or blue. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Pentameris alticola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
