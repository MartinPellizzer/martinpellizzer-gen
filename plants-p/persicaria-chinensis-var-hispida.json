It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
