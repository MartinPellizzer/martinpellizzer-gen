    "intro": "Pinus brachyptera, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its short, thick needles and distinctive cones that are often covered in a resinous coating. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its cones remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
