It features a rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in herbal remedies."
