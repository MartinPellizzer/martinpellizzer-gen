    "intro": "Phegopteris pennigera, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are divided into triangular pinnae with a distinctive, broad, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Phegopteris pennigera plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
