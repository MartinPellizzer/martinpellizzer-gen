    "intro": "Pagesia acuminata subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved acuminata, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of P. acuminata."
