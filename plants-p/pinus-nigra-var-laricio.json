    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. laricio, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. This evergreen conifer is valued for its timber and is also an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
