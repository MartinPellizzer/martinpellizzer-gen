It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
