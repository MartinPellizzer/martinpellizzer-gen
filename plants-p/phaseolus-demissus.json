It is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, edible beans, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other beans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional agriculture. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
