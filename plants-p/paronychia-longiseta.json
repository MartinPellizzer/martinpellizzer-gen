    "intro": "Paronychia longiseta, commonly known as the long-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to full sun conditions."
