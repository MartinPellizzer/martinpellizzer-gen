It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange flowers with a bilabiate corolla. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
