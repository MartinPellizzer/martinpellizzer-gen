    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus saxifragus, commonly known as the red stonecress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Pyrrhocactus saxifragus is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species found in regions with low rainfall."
