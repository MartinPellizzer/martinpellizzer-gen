    "intro": "Pitcairnia carnea, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a central cup that collects rainwater. Pitcairnia carnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
