    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. remota, commonly known as the remote alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly elongated leaves and more distant flower arrangement compared to other subspecies of Pilosella."
