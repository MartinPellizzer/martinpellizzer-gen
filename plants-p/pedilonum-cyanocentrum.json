    "intro": "Pedilonum cyanocentrum, commonly known as the blue-centred pedilonum, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vivid blue petals that contrast sharply with its pale green foliage. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, spurred lip. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
