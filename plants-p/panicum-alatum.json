    "intro": "Panicum alatum, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush due to its dense, bristly spikes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue. Panicum alatum is widely used in ornamental horticulture for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
