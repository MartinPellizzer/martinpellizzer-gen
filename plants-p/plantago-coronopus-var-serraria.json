It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and coastal areas. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf serrations compared to the typical form of Plantago coronopus."
