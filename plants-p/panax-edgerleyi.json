    "intro": "Panax edgerleyi, commonly known as the Edgerley ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species such as Panax ginseng. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and deeply lobed leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its rarity and medicinal potential, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine and is subject to conservation efforts."
