    "intro": "Polylepis lanuginosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the Andean woolly oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
