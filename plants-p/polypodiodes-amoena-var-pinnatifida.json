    "intro": "Polypodiodes amoena var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin, fibrous sheath, and the fronds are usually bioluminescent under certain conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
