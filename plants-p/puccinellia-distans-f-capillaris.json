    "intro": "Puccinellia distans f. capillaris, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender flowering stems. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy. The variety is distinguished by its elongated, slender leaves compared to the typical form of Puccinellia distans."
