    "intro": "Pyrus communis subsp. achras, commonly known as the common pear, is a species of deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in the autumn. The fruit, known as the pear, has a firm, juicy flesh and a mild, sweet flavor. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is used in both culinary and commercial applications."
