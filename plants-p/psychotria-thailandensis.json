It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Psychotria thailandensis is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses in traditional medicine."
