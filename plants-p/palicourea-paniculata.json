    "intro": "Palicourea paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
