    "intro": "Potentilla nyssana, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both visually appealing and relatively low maintenance."
