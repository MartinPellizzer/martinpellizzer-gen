    "intro": "Parkinsonia \u00d7 carterae, commonly known as the Mexican honey mesquite, is a hybrid leguminous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural and disturbed environments. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
