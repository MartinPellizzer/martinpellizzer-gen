    "intro": "Plantago deserticola var. typica, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
