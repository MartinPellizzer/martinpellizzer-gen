    "intro": "Portulaca fluvialis var. argentinensis, commonly known as the Argentinian river purslane, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing, succulent species that thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
