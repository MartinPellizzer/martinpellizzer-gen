    "intro": "Potentilla fagineicola, commonly known as the shrub cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Potentilla fagineicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh native environment."
