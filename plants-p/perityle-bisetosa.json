    "intro": "Perityle bisetosa, commonly known as the two-branched perityle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Perityle bisetosa is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
