    "intro": "Pachystele dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant has a short, thick stem and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachystele dubia is considered a vulnerable species."
