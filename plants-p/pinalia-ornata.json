    "intro": "Pinalia ornata, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble fluffy clouds, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters at the base, forming a compact rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Pinalia ornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
