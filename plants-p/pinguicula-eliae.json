    "intro": "Pinguicula eliae, commonly known as the Elie's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that forms rosettes of succulent, glandular leaves. The leaves are covered in sticky secretions that trap and digest small insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The plant's unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
