    "intro": "Poa quinquefida, commonly known as five-awned bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bristle-like awns, which are distinctive features. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Poa quinquefida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
