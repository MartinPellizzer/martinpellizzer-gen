    "intro": "Primula clevelandii var. patula, commonly known as the Cleveland's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
