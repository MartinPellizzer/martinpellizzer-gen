    "intro": "Physocarpon, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive pod-like fruits that enclose the seeds, often resembling small bladders. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Physocarpon species are often shrubs or small perennial plants with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Their ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
