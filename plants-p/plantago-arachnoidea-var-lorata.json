It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that often trail from the stem, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
