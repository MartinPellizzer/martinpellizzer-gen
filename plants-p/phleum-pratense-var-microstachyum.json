It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its fine, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and other open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
