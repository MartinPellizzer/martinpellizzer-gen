    "intro": "Polypodium acutangulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
