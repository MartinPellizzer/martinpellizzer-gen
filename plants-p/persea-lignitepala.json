    "intro": "Persea lignitepala, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like laurel and avocado. The tree produces small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. Its fruit is a small, sweet, and sometimes astringent berry that ripens in the fall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon species."
