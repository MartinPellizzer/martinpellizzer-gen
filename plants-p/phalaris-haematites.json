    "intro": "Phalaris haematites, commonly known as red false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish tinge on the lower parts. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem, with small, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in ecological studies and landscape restoration projects."
