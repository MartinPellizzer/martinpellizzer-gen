    "intro": "Parathesis travisiae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows on tree branches, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its flowers are often pale or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Parathesis travisiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
