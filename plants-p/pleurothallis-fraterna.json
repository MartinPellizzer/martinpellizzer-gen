    "intro": "Pleurothallis fraterna, commonly known as the \"fraternal orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pleurothallis fraterna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
