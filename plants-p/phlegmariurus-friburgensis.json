    "intro": "Phlegmariurus friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburg moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and clustered. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for dispersal. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
