It features lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and tolerance for dry conditions. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for terrariums and as a decorative houseplant."
