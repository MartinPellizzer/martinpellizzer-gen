    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan sword fern, is a variant of the bristle fern native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, spiny structures called aculei. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Its fronds can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
