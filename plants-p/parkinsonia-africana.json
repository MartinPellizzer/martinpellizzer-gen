    "intro": "Parkinsonia africana, commonly known as the umbrella thorn tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its flat, umbrella-like crown of feathery leaves and long, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. The wood is lightweight and used for construction and fuel, though it is not particularly strong."
