    "intro": "Pilosocereus pentaedrophorus subsp. pentaedrophorus, commonly known as the Five-ribbed Cactus, is a species of cactus native to northern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with prominent, angular ribs and spines that are typically yellow or brown in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
