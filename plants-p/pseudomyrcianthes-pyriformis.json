    "intro": "Pseudomyrcianthes pyriformis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
