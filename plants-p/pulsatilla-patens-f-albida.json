    "intro": "Pulsatilla patens f. albida, commonly known as the white pasqueflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its pale to white blossoms. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports its showy, five-petaled flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown in rock gardens or alpine settings."
