    "intro": "Pieris polita, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal changes and ability to attract pollinators."
