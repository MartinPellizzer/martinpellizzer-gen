    "intro": "Polystachya shirensis, commonly known as the Shirensis bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are borne on a tall inflorescence. Polystachya shirensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
