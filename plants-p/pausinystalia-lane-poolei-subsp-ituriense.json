    "intro": "Pausinystalia lane-poolei subsp. ituriense, commonly known as the Ituri arrow poison plant, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is native to the rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant produces a toxic sap that has been historically used by indigenous peoples for making poison-tipped arrows. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and its role in traditional hunting practices."
