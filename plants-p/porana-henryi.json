    "intro": "Porana henryi, commonly known as the Henry's porana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Porana henryi is considered a species of conservation concern."
