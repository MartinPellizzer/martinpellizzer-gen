    "intro": "Psammisia elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
