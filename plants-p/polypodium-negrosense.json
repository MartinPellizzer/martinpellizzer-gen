    "intro": "Polypodium negrosense, commonly known as the Negros holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
