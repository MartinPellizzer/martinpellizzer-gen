    "intro": "Petramnia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that are adapted to grow in rocky or crevice habitats. The plants typically have slender stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Petramnia species are native to regions with high altitudes and rocky terrain, such as parts of South America and the Andes. Their unique morphology and specialized growth habits make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
