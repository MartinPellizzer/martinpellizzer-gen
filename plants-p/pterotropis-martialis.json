    "intro": "Pterotropis martialis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
