It is a terrestrial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and flowering spikes. Native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
