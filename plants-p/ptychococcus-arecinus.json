    "intro": "Ptychococcus arecinus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
