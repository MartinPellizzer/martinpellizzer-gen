    "intro": "Psittacanthus cuneifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a tree-like structure with a central trunk covered in thick, leathery leaves that resemble the horns of a stag. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
