    "intro": "Polypodium stigmosum, commonly known as the stigmosum fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Polypodium stigmosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
