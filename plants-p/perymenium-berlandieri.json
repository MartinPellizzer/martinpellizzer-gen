    "intro": "Perymenium berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican firebush, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bright red or orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
