    "intro": "Phymatopteris laciniata, commonly known as the fringed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. The fringed maidenhair fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
