    "intro": "Petrosilene saxifragum, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and in rocky crevices. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
