    "intro": "Polygala sibirica f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in spicate inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
