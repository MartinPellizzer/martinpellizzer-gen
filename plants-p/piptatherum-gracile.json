    "intro": "Piptatherum gracile, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
