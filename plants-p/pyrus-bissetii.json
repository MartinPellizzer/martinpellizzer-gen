    "intro": "Pyrus bissetii, commonly known as Bisset's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. This deciduous shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-scented pears that ripen in late summer."
