    "intro": "Phytolacca mexicana, commonly known as Mexican pokeweed, is a shrub-like plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including lectins and\u7682\u82f7, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
