    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. maritimus, commonly known as saltmarsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal inundation. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and form monotypic stands. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
