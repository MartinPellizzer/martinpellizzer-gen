    "intro": "Pouteria membranacea, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a \"capsule,\" contains up to 18 seeds, which are the seeds of the Brazil nut. The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
