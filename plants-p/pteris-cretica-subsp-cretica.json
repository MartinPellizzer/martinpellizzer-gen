It features fronds that are typically upright and divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
