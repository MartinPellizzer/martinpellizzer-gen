    "intro": "Polypodium sinense, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium sinense is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
