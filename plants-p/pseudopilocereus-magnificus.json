    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
