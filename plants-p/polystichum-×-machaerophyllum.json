    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 machaerophyllum, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum milleflorium and Polystichum machaerophyllum. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, elongated pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
