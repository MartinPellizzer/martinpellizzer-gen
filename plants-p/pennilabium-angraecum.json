    "intro": "Pennilabium angraecum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that often display a mix of purple, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
