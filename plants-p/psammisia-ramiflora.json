    "intro": "Psammisia ramiflora, commonly known as the sand dune flax, is a perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. It produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Psammisia ramiflora plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
