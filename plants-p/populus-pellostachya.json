    "intro": "Populus pellostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Populus pellostachya is often found in moist soils near rivers or in wetlands, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
