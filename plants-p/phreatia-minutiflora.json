    "intro": "Phreatia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered phreatia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are characteristic of its genus. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
