    "intro": "Pandanus rotensis, commonly known as the Rotensis pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in the axils of the leaves, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
