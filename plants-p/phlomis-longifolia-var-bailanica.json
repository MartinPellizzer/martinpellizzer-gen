It features erect, branching stems covered in dense, grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, sunny conditions."
