    "intro": "Polygala obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broader towards the base. The plant produces small, greenish to yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
