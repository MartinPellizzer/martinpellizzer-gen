    "intro": "Pitcairnia micotrinensis, commonly known as the Micotrinensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of trichomes, which help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or red and are borne in a terminal inflorescence. Pitcairnia micotrinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
