    "intro": "Polygala cyparissias var. corisoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
