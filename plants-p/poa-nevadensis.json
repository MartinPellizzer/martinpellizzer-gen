    "intro": "Poa nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize soil in alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny blue flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Poa nevadensis is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
