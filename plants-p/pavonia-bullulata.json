    "intro": "Pavonia bullulata, commonly known as the purple crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, purple-pink flower heads that resemble a crown, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and can fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Pavonia bullulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
