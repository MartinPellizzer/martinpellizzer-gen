    "intro": "Plantago major var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
