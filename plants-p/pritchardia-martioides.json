    "intro": "Pritchardia martioides, commonly known as the Maui pine or the Hawaiian pineapple palm, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by native insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals, contributing to its ecological importance in Hawaiian forests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
