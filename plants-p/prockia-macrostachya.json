    "intro": "Prockia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant prockia, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, umbel-shaped inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Prockia macrostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
