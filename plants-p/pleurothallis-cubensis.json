    "intro": "Pleurothallis cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small epiphytic orchid native to Cuba, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, often pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
