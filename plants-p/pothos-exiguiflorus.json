    "intro": "Pothos exiguiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and anchor itself to surfaces, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves."
