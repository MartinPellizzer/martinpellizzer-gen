    "intro": "Polypodium ptiloton var. robustum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky substrates. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family Huperziaceae."
