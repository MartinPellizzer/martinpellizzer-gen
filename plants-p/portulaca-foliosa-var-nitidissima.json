    "intro": "Portulaca foliosa var. nitidissima, commonly known as the glossy purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care."
