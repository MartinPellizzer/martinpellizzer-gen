    "intro": "Pyrus nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf pear, is a species of tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The tree is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
