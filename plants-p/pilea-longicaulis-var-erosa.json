It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, green berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
