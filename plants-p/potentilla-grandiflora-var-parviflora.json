    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are characteristic of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
