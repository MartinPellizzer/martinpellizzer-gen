    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed field sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems with dense, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark, spherical berries that contain the seeds. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature compared to other varieties of Polycnemum, making it easily distinguishable in the field."
