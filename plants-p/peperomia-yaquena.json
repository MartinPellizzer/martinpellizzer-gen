It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and silver, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the spring or summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia yaquena is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
