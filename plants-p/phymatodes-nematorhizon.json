    "intro": "Phymatodes nematorhizon, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. The plant's spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration."
