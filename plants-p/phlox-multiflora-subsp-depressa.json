It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or ground covers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
