    "intro": "Pedicularis rhaetica proles letourneuxii, commonly known as the Rhaetian lousewort, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the European Alps. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes numerous species of flowering plants known for their unique, often spurred flowers. This particular species is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of vivid orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
