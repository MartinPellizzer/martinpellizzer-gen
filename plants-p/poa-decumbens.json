    "intro": "Poa decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Poa decumbens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse microbial and invertebrate communities."
