    "intro": "Polypodium tripinnatifidum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with multiple pairs of pinnae, giving it a complex, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops."
