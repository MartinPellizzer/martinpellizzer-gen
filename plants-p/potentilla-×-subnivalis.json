    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
