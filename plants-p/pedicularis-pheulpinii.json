    "intro": "Pedicularis pheulpinii, commonly known as the Pheulpin's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 400 species of flowering plants, many of which are hemiparasitic. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it attaches to the roots of other plants for partial nourishment. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. The species is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
