    "intro": "Pandanus obeliscus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. Pandanus obeliscus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, adapting well to saline and humid conditions."
