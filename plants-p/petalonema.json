    "intro": "Petalonema, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, usually white or yellow flowers. Petalonema species often have a woody stem and produce small, berry-like fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
