    "intro": "Pedicularis flavissima, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble tiny monkeys. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
