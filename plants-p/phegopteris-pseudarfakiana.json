    "intro": "Phegopteris pseudarfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the highlands of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
