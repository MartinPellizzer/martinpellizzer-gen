    "intro": "Polypodium mollendense, commonly known as the Andean huperzia, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium mollendense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
