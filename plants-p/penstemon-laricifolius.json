    "intro": "Penstemon laricifolius, commonly known as the mountain penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble those of a fir tree, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Penstemon laricifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
