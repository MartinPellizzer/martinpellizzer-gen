    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are deeply divided and give the tree a unique, feathery appearance. The tree produces small, spherical fruit clusters that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for urban environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities."
