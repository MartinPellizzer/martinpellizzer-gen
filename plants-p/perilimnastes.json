These plants are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. They are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are usually broad and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Perilimnastes species play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
