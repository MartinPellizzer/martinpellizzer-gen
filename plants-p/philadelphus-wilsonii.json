    "intro": "Philadelphus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's mockorange, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy blooms and its pleasant, citrus-like fragrance."
