    "intro": "Platostoma longicorne, commonly known as the long-horned flat-leaf liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its distinctive feature is the presence of long, slender horns on the reproductive structures, which are used for spore dispersal. Platostoma longicorne plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
