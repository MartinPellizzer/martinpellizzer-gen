    "intro": "Plocoglottis copelandii, commonly known as the golden spike fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a delicate, feathery appearance. Plocoglottis copelandii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
