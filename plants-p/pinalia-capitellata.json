It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Pinalia capitellata thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
