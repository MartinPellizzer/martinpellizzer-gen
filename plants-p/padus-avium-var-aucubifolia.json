    "intro": "Padus avium var. aucubifolia, commonly known as the white chokecherry. This variant of the common chokecherry is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which resembles that of aucuba, hence its name. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. The leaves are typically ovate to broadly ovate, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish drupes that ripen in late summer."
