    "intro": "Podocarpus chinensis subsp. wardii, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp, is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is native to China and Southeast Asia. It is a evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange or red aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
