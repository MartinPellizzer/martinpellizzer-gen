    "intro": "Pinus catarinae, commonly known as the Catarina pine, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. The Catarina pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
