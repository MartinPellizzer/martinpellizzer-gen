    "intro": "Panicum procurrens f. majus, commonly known as giant dropseed, is a tall, ornamental grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, creating a soft, flowing appearance in gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for moist to dry conditions. Its upright growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and natural landscapes."
