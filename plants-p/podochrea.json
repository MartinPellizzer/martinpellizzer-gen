    "intro": "Podochrea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its ornamental value and aromatic leaves. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and they produce small, clustered flowers with four or five petals. Podochrea species are valued for their wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for their medicinal properties. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in forest understories."
