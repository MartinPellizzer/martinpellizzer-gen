    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on rocky or shaded surfaces. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
