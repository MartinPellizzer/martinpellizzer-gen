    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. retroflexa, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variant is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
