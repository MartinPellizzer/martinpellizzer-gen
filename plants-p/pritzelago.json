    "intro": "Pritzelago, commonly known as the mountain pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pinkish ray florets, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. Pritzelago thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its growth is often limited by harsh weather conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in mountainous regions."
