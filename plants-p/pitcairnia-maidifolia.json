    "intro": "Pitcairnia maidifolia, commonly known as the banana pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with red bracts and small white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
