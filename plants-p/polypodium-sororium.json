    "intro": "Polypodium sororium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid environments with indirect light. The plant has feather-like fronds that are often divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Polypodium sororium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
