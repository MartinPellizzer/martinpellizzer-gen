    "intro": "Paronychia hispanica var. oblonga, commonly known as Spanish thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots and low-growing habit make it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
