    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it well adapted for nutrient acquisition in its specialized habitat."
