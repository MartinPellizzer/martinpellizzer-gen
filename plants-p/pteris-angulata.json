    "intro": "Pteris angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Pteris angulata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
