    "intro": "Pellaea burkeana, commonly known as the silver-velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It features delicate, pinnate leaves with a silvery, velvety appearance due to its dense covering of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pellaea burkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
