    "intro": "Phyllota phylicoides var. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly phyllota, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its densely hairy, often grayish foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and landscapes."
