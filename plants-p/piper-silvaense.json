    "intro": "Piper silvaense, commonly known as the Silvaense pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to attach to trees and other structures. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, and the fruit is a one-seeded berry that turns red when mature."
