    "intro": "Primula speciosa, commonly known as the showy primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant's foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Primula speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
