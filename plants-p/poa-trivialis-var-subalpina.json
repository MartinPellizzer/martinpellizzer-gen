    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
