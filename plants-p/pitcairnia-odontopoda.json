    "intro": "Pitcairnia odontopoda, commonly known as the toothed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
