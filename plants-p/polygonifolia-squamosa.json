    "intro": "Polygonifolia squamosa, commonly known as the scaly-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly appearance on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are often divided into narrow, linear segments, and it produces small, clustered flowers. Polygonifolia squamosa is valued both for its ornamental qualities and for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
