    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 amygdalo-persica, commonly known as the apricot plum, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between apricot (Prunus armeniaca) and peach (Prunus persica). It typically exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a combination of fruit size, color, and flavor. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree with alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a drupe, with a fuzzy skin and a sweet, juicy flesh that ripens in late spring to early summer."
