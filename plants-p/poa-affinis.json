    "intro": "Poa affinis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with fine, blade-like leaves that are often covered in short hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
