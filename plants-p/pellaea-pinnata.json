    "intro": "Pellaea pinnata, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like leaves that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its fronds. Pellaea pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
