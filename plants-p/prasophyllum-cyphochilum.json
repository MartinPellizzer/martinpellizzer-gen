    "intro": "Prasophyllum cyphochilum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern regions of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that blooms during the summer months, producing a single spike of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
