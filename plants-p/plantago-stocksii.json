    "intro": "Plantago stocksii, commonly known as the stock's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wet meadows. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. It is part of the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its rosette growth habit. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
