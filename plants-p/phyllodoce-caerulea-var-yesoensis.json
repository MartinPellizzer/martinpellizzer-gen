    "intro": "Phyllodoce caerulea var. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso blue moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It features dense, compact foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes form a dense mat, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
