    "intro": "Paspalum eucomum, commonly known as the velvet paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
