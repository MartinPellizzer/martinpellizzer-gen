    "intro": "Polypodium vulpinum, commonly known as the fox's tail fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive, dense, and upright frond structure that resembles a fox's tail, with numerous small, finger-like pinnae. The plant prefers moist, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. It is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate occasional drought once established. Its ornamental value comes from its lush, green foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
