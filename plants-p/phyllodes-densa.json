    "intro": "Phyllodes densa, commonly known as the dense phyllode wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are typically narrow and have a feathery appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. Phyllodes densa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
