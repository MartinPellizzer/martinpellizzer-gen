It is a small, moss-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions of Japan. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like structure with a central axis and leaf-like structures on either side. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. This species is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological niche."
