    "intro": "Pterocarpus hockii, commonly known as the Malabar devilwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pterocarpus hockii is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its role in traditional medicine."
