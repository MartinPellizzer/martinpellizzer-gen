    "intro": "Polygala engleri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
