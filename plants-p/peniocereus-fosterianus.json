    "intro": "Peniocereus fosterianus, commonly known as the Foster's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a compact, rounded body that often forms a dense mat. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers at night, which open briefly and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, making it a notable plant for desert gardens and conservation efforts."
