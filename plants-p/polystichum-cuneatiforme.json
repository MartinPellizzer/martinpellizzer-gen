    "intro": "Polystichum cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright, arching fronds. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with finely divided, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings."
