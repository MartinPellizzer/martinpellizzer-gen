    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata f. pleiocephala, commonly known as the broad-headed plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This form is notable for its more robust and broader leaves compared to the typical form of Plantago lanceolata."
