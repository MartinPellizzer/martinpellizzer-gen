    "intro": "Pinus massoniana subsp. wulingensis, commonly known as the Wuling fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to central China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are small and usually hang downward, containing two to three seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for both ecological and conservation studies."
