    "intro": "Peperomia enckeifolia, commonly known as the Velvetleaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and velvety silver underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia enckeifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
