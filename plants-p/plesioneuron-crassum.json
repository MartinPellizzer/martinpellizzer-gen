    "intro": "Plesioneuron crassum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance."
