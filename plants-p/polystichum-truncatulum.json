    "intro": "Polystichum truncatulum, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated fronds that are often cut or notched at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum truncatulum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
