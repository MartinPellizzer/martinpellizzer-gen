    "intro": "Pilosella procera, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella procera is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
