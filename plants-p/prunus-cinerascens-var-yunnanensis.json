    "intro": "Prunus cinerascens var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet cherries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for local use."
