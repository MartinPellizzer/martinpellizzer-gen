    "intro": "Phacelia leucophylla var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
