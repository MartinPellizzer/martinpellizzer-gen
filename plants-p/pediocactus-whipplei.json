    "intro": "Pediocactus whipplei, commonly known as the Whipple's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a solitary, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and dense, radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Pediocactus whipplei is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
