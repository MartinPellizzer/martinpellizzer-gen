    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. It produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium loriceum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types when provided with the right conditions."
