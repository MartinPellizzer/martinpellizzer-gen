It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and glossy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
