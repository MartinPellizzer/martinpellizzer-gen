    "intro": "Petrocosmea martini, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its small, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Petrocosmea martini is considered endangered and requires protection."
