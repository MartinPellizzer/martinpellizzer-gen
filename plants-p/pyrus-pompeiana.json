    "intro": "Pyrus pompeiana, commonly known as the Pompeian pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the volcanic soils of Pompeii. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a pale yellow to greenish skin and a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with alternate, ovate leaves that have a rough texture. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in clusters, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. Due to its historical significance and limited natural habitat, Pyrus pompeiana is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its genetic and ecological value."
