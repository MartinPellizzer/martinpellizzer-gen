    "intro": "Plumbago sarmentosa, commonly known as blue plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and ability to cascade from containers or grow along trellises."
