    "intro": "Peniocereus macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a ribbed stem that stores water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are ephemeral, appearing only after rainfall, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. The species is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
