    "intro": "Polygonum sawatchense subsp. oblivium, commonly known as the oblivion polygon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Colorado Rockies. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive bracteate inflorescences and stipitate nodes. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spikelike arrangements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems."
