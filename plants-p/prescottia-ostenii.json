    "intro": "Prescottia ostenii, commonly known as the Mexican star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. Prescottia ostenii is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for tropical gardens and greenhouses."
