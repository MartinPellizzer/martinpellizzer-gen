    "intro": "Pectis urceolata, commonly known as the spoonleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The species is adapted to drought conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
