    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus subsp. coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare subspecies native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in Mexico. It is a tall evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves and a conical shape. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common reproductive strategy among pines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
