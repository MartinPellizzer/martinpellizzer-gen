It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
