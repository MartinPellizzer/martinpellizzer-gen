    "intro": "Portulaca suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning and close during the heat of the day. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Portulaca suffruticosa is drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
