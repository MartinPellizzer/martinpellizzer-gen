    "intro": "Paspalum minutum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features slender, wiry stems and small, compact spikelets that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually green or pale in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in erosion control or as a ground cover in landscaping."
