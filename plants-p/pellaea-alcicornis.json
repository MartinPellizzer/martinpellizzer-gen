    "intro": "Pellaea alcicornis, commonly known as the fringed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often tinged with red or pink at the tips. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The fringed appearance of its fronds is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in its identification."
