    "intro": "Pratia arenaria, commonly known as beach sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, saline environments and is well-adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions such as strong winds and salt spray. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Pratia arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion along coastal regions."
