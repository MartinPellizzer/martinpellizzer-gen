    "intro": "Planchonella sandwicensis f. puulupensis, commonly known as the Puulupensis variant of the Hawaiian sandwicensis, is a rare endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Hawaii. Its fruit is a small, smooth drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
