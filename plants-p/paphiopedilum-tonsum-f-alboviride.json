    "intro": "Paphiopedilum tonsum f. alboviride, commonly known as the white-green lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically pale green with white veins, giving it its common name. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
