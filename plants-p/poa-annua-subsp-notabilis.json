    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. notabilis, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and the presence of short, dense tufts of silver-colored hairs along the leaf blades. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. It produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens."
