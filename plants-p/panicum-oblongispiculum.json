    "intro": "Panicum oblongispiculum, commonly known as the narrow-spike panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
