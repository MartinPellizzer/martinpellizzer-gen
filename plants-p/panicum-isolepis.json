    "intro": "Panicum isolepis, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
