    "intro": "Primula kaufmanniana, commonly known as the Kaufmann's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils in cool, moist environments. Primula kaufmanniana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in temperate climates."
