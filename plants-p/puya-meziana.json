    "intro": "Puya meziana, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, upright stem and dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual impact. Puya meziana is adapted to harsh, cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
