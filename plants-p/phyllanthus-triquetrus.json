    "intro": "Phyllanthus triquetrus, commonly known as the three-angled sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-angled fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance. Phyllanthus triquetrus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and supports local biodiversity."
