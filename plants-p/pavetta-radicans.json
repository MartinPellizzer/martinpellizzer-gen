    "intro": "Pavetta radicans, commonly known as the climbing pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its twining stems that climb along supports, and its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by blue-black berries. Pavetta radicans is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
