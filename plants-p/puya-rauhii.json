    "intro": "Puya rauhii, commonly known as the Andes torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, showy flower spike that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing vibrant red and orange bracts. Puya rauhii is known for its slow growth and long flowering period, which can last several months. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and conservatories."
