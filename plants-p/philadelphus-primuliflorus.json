    "intro": "Philadelphus primuliflorus, commonly known as the early meadowweet, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its floral display consists of clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, red berries. Philadelphus primuliflorus prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky or alpine gardens."
