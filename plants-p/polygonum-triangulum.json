    "intro": "Polygonum triangulum, commonly known as the triangular knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features triangular-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
