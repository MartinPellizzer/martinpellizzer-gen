    "intro": "Plantago clausa, commonly known as the closed plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain mucilage, making them useful in traditional medicine for soothing irritated tissues. Plantago clausa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
