    "intro": "Parabaena tuberculata, commonly known as the roughleaf parabaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Parabaena tuberculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
