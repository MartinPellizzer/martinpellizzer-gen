It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three lance-shaped lobes, and its stems are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Pinalia triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
