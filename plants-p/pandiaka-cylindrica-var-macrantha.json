It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, and its most distinctive characteristic is its large, showy flower spikes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in marshes or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
