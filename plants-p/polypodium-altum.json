    "intro": "Polypodium altum, commonly known as the tall wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow fronds that can reach several feet in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of leaflets. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium altum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to various substrates in its natural habitat."
