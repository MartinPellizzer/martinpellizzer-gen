    "intro": "Parthenostachys pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
