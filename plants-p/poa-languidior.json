    "intro": "Poa languidior, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Poa languidior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
