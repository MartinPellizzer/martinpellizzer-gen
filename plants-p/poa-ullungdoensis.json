    "intro": "Poa ullungdoensis, commonly known as the Ulungdo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
