    "intro": "Pouteria puberula, commonly known as the silky wax tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling small, round drupes. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
