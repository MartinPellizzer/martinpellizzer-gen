It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-awned spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa microstachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife."
