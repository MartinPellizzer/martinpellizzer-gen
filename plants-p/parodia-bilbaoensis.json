    "intro": "Parodia bilbaoensis, commonly known as the Bilbao Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, ribbed stem covered in pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
