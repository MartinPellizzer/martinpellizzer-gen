    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyab\u00e9n cactus, is a flowering plant native to northern South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It has spines that provide protection against herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
