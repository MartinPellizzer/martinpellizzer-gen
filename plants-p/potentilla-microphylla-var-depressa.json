    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The variety 'depressa' is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Potentilla microphylla."
