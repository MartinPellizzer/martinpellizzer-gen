It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Psychotria paupertina is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
