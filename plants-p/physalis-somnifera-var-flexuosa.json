It is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small, lantern-like structure. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that are typically harvested when fully mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its mild, tangy flavor."
