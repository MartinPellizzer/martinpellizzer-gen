    "intro": "Penstemon speciosus subsp. lemhiensis, commonly known as the Lemhi penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
