    "intro": "Pennisetum verticillatum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a ornamental grass native to Africa. It features tufts of slender, silver-green leaves that radiate from a central point, creating a fountain-like appearance. The plant produces fluffy, white or pale pink plumes during the summer months, which add visual interest. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
