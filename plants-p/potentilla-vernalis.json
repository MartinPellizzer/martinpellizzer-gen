    "intro": "Potentilla vernalis, commonly known as spring cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, usually from April to June. Its leaves are palmately divided into five leaflets, which are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Potentilla vernalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
