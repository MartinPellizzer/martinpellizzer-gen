    "intro": "Panax chapelieri, commonly known as the Cameroon ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are believed to contain bioactive compounds, though research on its medicinal properties is limited. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Panax chapelieri is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
