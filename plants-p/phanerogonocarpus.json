    "intro": "Phanerogonocarpus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, typical of the Polygonaceae family. Phanerogonocarpus is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions."
