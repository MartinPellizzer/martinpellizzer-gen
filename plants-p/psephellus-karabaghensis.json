    "intro": "Psephellus karabaghensis, commonly known as the Karabakh psephellus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
