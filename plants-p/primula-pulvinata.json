    "intro": "Primula pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage that forms a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Primula pulvinata is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
