It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by hard, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
