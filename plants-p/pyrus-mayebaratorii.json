    "intro": "Pyrus mayebaratorii, commonly known as the Mayebaratorii pear, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to a specific region in eastern Asia, where it grows in temperate climates. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
