    "intro": "Pouteria ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces hard-shelled fruits that contain edible seeds, which are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat. Its growth is typically slow, requiring several decades to reach maturity and begin producing nuts."
