    "intro": "Poa annua var. stricta, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, dark green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings."
