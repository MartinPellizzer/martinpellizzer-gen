    "intro": "Pavetta assimilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features simple, opposite, and usually smooth-stemmed leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
