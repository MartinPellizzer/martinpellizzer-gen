    "intro": "Polystichum deltodon var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
