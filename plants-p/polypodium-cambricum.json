    "intro": "Polypodium cambricum, commonly known as the British water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are pinnately divided and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in damp, calcareous soils."
