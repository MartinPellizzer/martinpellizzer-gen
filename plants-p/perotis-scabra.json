It is characterized by its hairy, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Perotis scabra is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family, often found in open plains and rocky habitats."
