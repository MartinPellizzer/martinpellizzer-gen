    "intro": "Poa cenisia var. halleridis, commonly known as the Haller's bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique ecological niche and ornamental potential."
