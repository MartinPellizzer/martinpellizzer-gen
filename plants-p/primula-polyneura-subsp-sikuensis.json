    "intro": "Primula polyneura subsp. sikuensis, commonly known as the Sikuensis primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
