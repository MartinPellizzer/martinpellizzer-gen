    "intro": "Parahebe brassii, commonly known as the silver parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-white to bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal or woodland settings."
