    "intro": "Psychotria killipii, commonly known as Killip's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of tropical rainforests. Psychotria killipii is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
