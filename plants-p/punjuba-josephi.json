    "intro": "Punjuba josephi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water, and its stems are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry environments. Punjuba josephi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
