    "intro": "Philodendron furcatum, commonly known as the split-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often split into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron furcatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
