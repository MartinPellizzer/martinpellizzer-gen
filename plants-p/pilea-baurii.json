    "intro": "Pilea baurii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea baurii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
