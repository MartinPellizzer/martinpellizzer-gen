    "intro": "Poncirus trifoliata var. monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted trifoliate orange, is a unique variant of the trifoliate orange plant. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted branches and foliage, which give it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. This variety is native to China and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal. It retains the citrus-like scent of its parent species and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for colder climates. However, it produces small, inedible fruits and is not typically used for culinary purposes."
