    "intro": "Physalis villosa, commonly known as the hairy groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
