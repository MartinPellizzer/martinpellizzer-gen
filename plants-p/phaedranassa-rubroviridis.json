    "intro": "Phaedranassa rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-and-green tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, persistent rachis, with a crown of fronds that are often bright green with red veins. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with long, narrow segments that contribute to its elegant appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
