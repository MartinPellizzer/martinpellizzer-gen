    "intro": "Pyrus fasciata, commonly known as the striped pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive white and green striped bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that resemble pears. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Pyrus fasciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
