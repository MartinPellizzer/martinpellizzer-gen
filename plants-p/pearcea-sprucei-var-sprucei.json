    "intro": "Pearcea sprucei var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's pearcea, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
