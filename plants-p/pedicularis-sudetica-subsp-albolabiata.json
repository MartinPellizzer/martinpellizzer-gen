    "intro": "Pedicularis sudetica subsp. albolabiata, commonly known as the White-lipped Monkey Orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The species is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Sudetes and surrounding areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
