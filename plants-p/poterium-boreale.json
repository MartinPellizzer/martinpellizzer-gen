    "intro": "Poterium boreale, commonly known as the northern snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold climates. Poterium boreale thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its growth is closely tied to the short growing season of its habitat, making it a resilient and specialized flora species."
