    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum patens, commonly known as the spreading paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
