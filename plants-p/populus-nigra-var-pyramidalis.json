    "intro": "Populus nigra var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a cultivar of the black poplar native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in riparian zones. Due to its fast growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes planted as a shade tree or for erosion control."
