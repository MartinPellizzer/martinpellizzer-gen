    "intro": "Pueraria phaseoloides var. javanica, commonly known as the Javan climbing bean, is a perennial vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its long, climbing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems for soil enrichment."
