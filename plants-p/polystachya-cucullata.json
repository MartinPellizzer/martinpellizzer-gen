It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces aerial roots and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense stands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Polystachya cucullata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
