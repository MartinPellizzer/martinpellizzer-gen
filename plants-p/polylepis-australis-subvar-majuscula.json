    "intro": "Polylepis australis subvar. majuscula, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and unique, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant thrives in cool, dry conditions and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
