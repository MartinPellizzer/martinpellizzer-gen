    "intro": "Psychotria brenesii, commonly known as the Costa Rican psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
