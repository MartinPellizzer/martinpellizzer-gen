    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled blackthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The narrow-petaled variety distinguishes it from other Prunus species by its unique floral structure."
