    "intro": "Podocarpus ballivianensis, commonly known as the Andean podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the highlands of South America. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like structures. The plant is adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important resource in local economies. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and overexploitation."
