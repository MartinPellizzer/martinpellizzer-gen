    "intro": "Pachycarpus schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's thick-leafed plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
