    "intro": "Pyrola nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort or roundleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern forests of North America. It typically forms dense mats of glossy, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees. Pyrola nummularia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Its leaves and flowers contain aromatic compounds, contributing to its use in traditional herbal medicine."
