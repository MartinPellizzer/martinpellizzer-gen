    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subvar. kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, tall stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its beauty and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
