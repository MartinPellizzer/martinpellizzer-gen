    "intro": "Pottsia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pottsia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its finely divided, glossy green fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Pottsia densiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
