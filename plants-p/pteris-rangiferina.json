    "intro": "Pteris rangiferina, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds. It is a tropical and subtropical plant that typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a leathery texture and a rugged, rugged appearance. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, porous growing media. The plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
