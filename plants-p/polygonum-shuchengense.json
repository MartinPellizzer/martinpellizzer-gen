    "intro": "Polygonum shuchengense, commonly known as Shucheng smartweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and marshy areas, and is often found in the Yangtze River basin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
