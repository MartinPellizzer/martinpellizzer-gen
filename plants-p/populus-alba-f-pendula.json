    "intro": "Populus alba f. pendula, commonly known as the white poplar weeping form, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape elegantly from the canopy. It is a cultivar of the white poplar (Populus alba), native to Europe and western Asia, and is valued for its unique, flowing appearance. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are pale green on the underside, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, fluffy white flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse easily in the wind. This cultivar thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
