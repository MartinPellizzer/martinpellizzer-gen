It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
