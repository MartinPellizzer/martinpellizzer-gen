    "intro": "Paspalum scalare var. villosulum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
