    "intro": "Premna obtusifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-leafed premna, is a variant of the Premna obtusifolia species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves that are generally pubescent, or covered in fine hairs. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
