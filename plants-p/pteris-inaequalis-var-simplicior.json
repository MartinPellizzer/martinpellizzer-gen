    "intro": "Pteris inaequalis var. simplicior, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that give it a unique, almost ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
