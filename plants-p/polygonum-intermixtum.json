    "intro": "Polygonum intermixtum, commonly known as the mixed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other species like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib and are often covered in fine hairs. Small, clustered greenish-white flowers appear in summer, followed by three-lobed, reddish-brown seed capsules."
