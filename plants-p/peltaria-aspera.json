    "intro": "Peltaria aspera, commonly known as the rough peltaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Peltaria aspera is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species in its native habitat."
