    "intro": "Pinus rohanii, commonly known as the Rohan pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five, and its cones are woody, with a distinctive elongated shape. It plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
