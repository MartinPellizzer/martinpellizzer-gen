    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. geminatum, commonly known as the geminate huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitats."
