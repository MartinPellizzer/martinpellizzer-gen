    "intro": "Poa pachypogon, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are often bristly or hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa pachypogon plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
