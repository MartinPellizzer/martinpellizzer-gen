    "intro": "Pilea notata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features round, fleshy leaves that are typically light green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Pilea notata is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to enhance indoor spaces with its lush foliage."
