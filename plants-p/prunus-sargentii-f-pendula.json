    "intro": "Prunus sargentii f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a cultivar of the Prunus sargentii species, which is native to China. It is characterized by its elegant, cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the flowering display. While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, it also has some medicinal uses in traditional Chinese medicine."
