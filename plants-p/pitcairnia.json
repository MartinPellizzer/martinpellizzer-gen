    "intro": "Pitcairnia, commonly known as the \"queen of the bromeliads,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Bromeliaceae family. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and the Andes. Pitcairnia species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin, a feature common among bromeliads. They produce striking inflorescences with showy, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
