    "intro": "Prunus americana f. rosea, commonly known as the American cherry or wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and showy, pink to white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that ripens in late summer. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
