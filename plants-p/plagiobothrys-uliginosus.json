    "intro": "Plagiobothrys uliginosus, commonly known as the bog bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in wet, acidic soils such as bogs and marshes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
