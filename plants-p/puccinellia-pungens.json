    "intro": "Puccinellia pungens, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bluish-gray foliage, which helps it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal grasslands. Puccinellia pungens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
