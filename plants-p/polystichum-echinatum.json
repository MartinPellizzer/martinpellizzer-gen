    "intro": "Polystichum echinatum, commonly known as the hawksbeard fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spiny structures along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum echinatum plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
