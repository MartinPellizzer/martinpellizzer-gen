    "intro": "Pitcairnia poeppigiana, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects water, providing a habitat for small organisms. Pitcairnia poeppigiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting, showy display."
