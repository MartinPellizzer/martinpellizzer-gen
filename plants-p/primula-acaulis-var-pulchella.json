    "intro": "Primula acaulis var. pulchella, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundras. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
