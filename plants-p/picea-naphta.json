    "intro": "Picea naphta, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are typically light green to white in color. The tree produces small, oval-shaped cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming flaky with age, and it thrives in cold climates with well-drained soil. The white spruce is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests."
