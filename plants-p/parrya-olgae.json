    "intro": "Parrya olgae, commonly known as the coastal parrya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. Parrya olgae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
