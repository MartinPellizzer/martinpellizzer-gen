    "intro": "Panicum zeyheri, commonly known as Zeyher's grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Panicum zeyheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
