    "intro": "Paspalum antillense, commonly known as the Caribbean grass or antillean paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Paspalum antillense is sometimes used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to stabilize soil."
