    "intro": "Peucedanum canbyi, commonly known as Canby's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its fruits are small, dry, and ridged, containing the seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
