    "intro": "Phyllocladus hypophyllus, commonly known as the silver pine, is a unique conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense, overlapping clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The species is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
