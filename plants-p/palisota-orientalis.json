    "intro": "Palisota orientalis, commonly known as the oriental arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Palisota orientalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
