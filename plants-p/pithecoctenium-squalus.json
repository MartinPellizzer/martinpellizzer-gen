It is a shrub that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The swamp hibiscus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
