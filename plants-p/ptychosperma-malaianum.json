    "intro": "Ptychosperma malaianum, commonly known as the Malayan cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
