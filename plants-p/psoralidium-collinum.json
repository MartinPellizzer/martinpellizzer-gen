    "intro": "Psoralidium collinum, commonly known as the mountain psoralidium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Psoralidium collinum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
