    "intro": "Polypodium subimmersum f. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests. The plant's fronds are usually elongated and have a narrow, lance-shaped appearance, which distinguishes it from other polypodium species. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
