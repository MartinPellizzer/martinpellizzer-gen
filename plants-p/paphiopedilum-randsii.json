    "intro": "Paphiopedilum randsii, commonly known as the Rands' lady's slipper, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped lip that resembles a lady's shoe. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a unique ornamental value to horticultural collections. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected in many regions."
