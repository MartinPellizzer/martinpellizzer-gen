    "intro": "Pallavia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like material, which aids in wind dispersal. Pallavia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
