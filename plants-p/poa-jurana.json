    "intro": "Poa jurana, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems. Poa jurana is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrients."
