    "intro": "Persea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by orange to reddish fruits. Its fruit, similar to persimmons, is edible and has a sweet, astringent flavor. Persea littoralis thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the coast and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds."
