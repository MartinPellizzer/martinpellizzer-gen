    "intro": "Pittosporum muticum, commonly known as the beach pittosporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along coastal dunes and cliffs."
