    "intro": "Phoradendron yucatanum, commonly known as the Yucatan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, through its sticky seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
