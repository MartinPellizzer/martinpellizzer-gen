    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines along the margins."
