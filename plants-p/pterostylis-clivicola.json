    "intro": "Pterostylis clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or brownish flower that resembles a small orchid. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes or cliffs, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late autumn to early winter, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
