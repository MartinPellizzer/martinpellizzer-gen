    "intro": "Pelargonium xerophyton, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
