    "intro": "Populus octorabdos, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The white poplar is also known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate pollution, making it a common urban tree."
