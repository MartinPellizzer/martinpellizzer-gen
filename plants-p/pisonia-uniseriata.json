    "intro": "Pisonia uniseriata, commonly known as the single-seeded pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that contains a single, large, elliptical seed, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. Pisonia uniseriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive floral display."
