    "intro": "Pentadenia lophophora, commonly known as the roughleaf pentadenia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
