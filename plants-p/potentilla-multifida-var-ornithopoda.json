    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. ornithopoda, commonly known as the featherleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage. This variety is closely related to other members of the Potentilla genus, which includes many species with similar growth habits and floral characteristics."
