    "intro": "Panicum acuminatum var. fasciculatum, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, blue-green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or prairies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
