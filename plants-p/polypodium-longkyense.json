    "intro": "Polypodium longkyense, commonly known as the longleaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
