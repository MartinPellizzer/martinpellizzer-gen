    "intro": "Primula tschuktschorum var. beringensis, commonly known as the Bering Primrose, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh climates. This variant is notable for its adaptability to extreme environments and its role in pollination by early-season insects."
