    "intro": "Polypodium serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in circinate structures known as sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular species for horticultural and ecological studies."
