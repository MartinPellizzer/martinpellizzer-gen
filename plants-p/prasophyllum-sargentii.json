    "intro": "Prasophyllum sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in heathland and open forests, particularly in the southern regions of Australia. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, leek-like appearance. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with high rainfall. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions."
