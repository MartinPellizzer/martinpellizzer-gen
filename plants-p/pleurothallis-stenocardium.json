    "intro": "Pleurothallis stenocardium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted for efficient water retention in its natural habitat. Due to its delicate nature and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled greenhouse conditions."
