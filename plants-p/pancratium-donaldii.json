    "intro": "Pancratium donaldii, commonly known as the golden arum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange inflorescence that resembles a spathe, surrounded by a cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It produces a single, tall stem that bears the showy flower, which is often used in ornamental horticulture. Pancratium donaldii is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds."
