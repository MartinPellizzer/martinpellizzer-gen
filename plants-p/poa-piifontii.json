    "intro": "Poa piifontii, commonly known as the Pifonti bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, mountainous environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh weather conditions. Poa piifontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
