It produces distinctive papery calyces that enclose its orange-yellow, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with five petals, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn. The fruits are edible when fully ripe and are often used in culinary applications or as ornamental plants."
