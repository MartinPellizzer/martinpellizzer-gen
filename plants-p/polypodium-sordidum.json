    "intro": "Polypodium sordidum, commonly known as the sordid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium sordidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
