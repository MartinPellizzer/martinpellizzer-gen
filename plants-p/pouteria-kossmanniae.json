    "intro": "Pouteria kossmanniae, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, fibrous shell and are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a long growing season to produce fruit. The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
