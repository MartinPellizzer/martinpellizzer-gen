    "intro": "Phacelia inundata, commonly known as the water phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers and hairy, branching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common annual in its native habitat. Phacelia inundata plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
