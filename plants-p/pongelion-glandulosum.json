    "intro": "Pongelion glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular pongelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous stature and distinctive glandular structures on its stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
