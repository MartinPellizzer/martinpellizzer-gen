    "intro": "Psychotria nubisylvae, commonly known as the cloud forest psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typical of its cloud forest habitat. Psychotria nubisylvae is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understory of dense forests, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems."
