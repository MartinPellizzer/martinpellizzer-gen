    "intro": "Pandanus puniceus, commonly known as the crimson pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often bright red or orange in color. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or green. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its fruits are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
