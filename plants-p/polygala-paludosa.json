It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, branching stems that often reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The small, clustered flowers are usually pink or violet, and they bloom from late spring to early summer."
