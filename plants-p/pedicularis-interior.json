    "intro": "Pedicularis interior, commonly known as the interior lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It has fleshy leaves and stems that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pedicularis interior is considered a rare and sensitive species."
