    "intro": "Potentilla polymorpha var. cinerea, commonly known as gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
