It is characterized by its lack of leaves, which is an unusual feature among flowering plants. Instead of leaves, it has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
