    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 bollwylleriana var. bulbiformis, commonly known as the bulbous pear, is a hybrid plant that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its bulbous, swollen stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits that are similar in taste to pears. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
