    "intro": "Pedicularis flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often resembling orchids. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain nutrients. Due to its specialized ecological niche, it is considered a rare and elusive species."
