    "intro": "Pomatocalpa elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
