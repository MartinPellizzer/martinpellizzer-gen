    "intro": "Picrasma quassioides f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed quassia, is a variant of the quassia tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, with the bark containing quassinoids used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
