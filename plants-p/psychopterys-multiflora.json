    "intro": "Psychopterys multiflora, commonly known as the Mexican white sage, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Psychopterys multiflora is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal practices."
