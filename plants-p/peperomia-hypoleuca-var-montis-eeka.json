    "intro": "Peperomia hypoleuca var. montis-eeka, commonly known as the Ecuadorean Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
