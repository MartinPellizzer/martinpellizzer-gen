    "intro": "Polyactium fulgidum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a member of the family Polytrichaceae. It is a small, evergreen moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with bright yellow-green leaves that are often curled at the tips. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks at the base of the plant. Polyactium fulgidum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
