    "intro": "Phyllanthus ligustrifolius, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright orange, berry-like fruits. These fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The botanical features of Phyllanthus ligustrifolius make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
