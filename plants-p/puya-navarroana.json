    "intro": "Puya navarroana, commonly known as the Navarroan grass of fire, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family, known for its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to conserve water in its high-altitude environment. Puya navarroana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
