    "intro": "Phyllorkis penicillium, commonly known as the blue mold fungus, is a type of Aspergillus species that is primarily characterized by its blue or greenish pigmentation. It is a filamentous fungus that produces spores in large quantities, which can be dispersed through the air. This fungus is often found in damp or humid environments, such as on decaying organic matter or in soil. It is not typically considered a plant but is sometimes mistaken for one due to its growth patterns. Phyllorkis penicillium can be both a decomposer and a potential contaminant in food and pharmaceutical products."
