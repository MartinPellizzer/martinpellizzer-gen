    "intro": "Pandanophyllum immersum, commonly known as the water pandan, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate and facilitating nutrient absorption. The botanical features of Pandanophyllum immersum make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
