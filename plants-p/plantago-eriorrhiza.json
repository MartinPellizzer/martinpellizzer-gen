It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal remedies."
