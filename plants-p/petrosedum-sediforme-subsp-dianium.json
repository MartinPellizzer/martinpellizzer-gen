It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold temperatures, contributing to its popularity among gardeners in cooler climates."
