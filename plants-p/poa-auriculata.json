    "intro": "Poa auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive auriculate (ear-like) auricles at the base of the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
