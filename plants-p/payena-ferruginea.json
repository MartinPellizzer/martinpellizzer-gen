    "intro": "Payena ferruginea, commonly known as the red ironwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and dark brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a rough texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing small, elliptical seeds. Payena ferruginea is also noted for its ability to thrive in dry and nutrient-poor soils, making it an important species in forest ecosystems."
