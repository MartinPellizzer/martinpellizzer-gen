It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that form dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing several small, two-rowed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
