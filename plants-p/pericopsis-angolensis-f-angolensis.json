    "intro": "Pericopsis angolensis f. angolensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to central and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain flat, elongated seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
