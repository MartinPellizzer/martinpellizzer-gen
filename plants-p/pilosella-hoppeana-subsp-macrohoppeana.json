    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. macrohoppeana, commonly known as the large-leaved hawk's-beard, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that are often larger than those of other Pilosella species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower head surrounded by bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger leaf size compared to closely related taxa."
