    "intro": "Prunus japonica var. eujaponica, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or some varieties as the weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic beauty rather than for fruit production."
