    "intro": "Pyrus cinovskisii, commonly known as the Cinovskii pear, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters, characterized by its slender, upright branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it is not widely cultivated."
