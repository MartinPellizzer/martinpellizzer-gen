    "intro": "Phreatia paleata, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. The plant has elongated, pale green pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with a delicate, ghostly appearance. It relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phreatia paleata is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
