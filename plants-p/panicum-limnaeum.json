    "intro": "Panicum limnaeum, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
