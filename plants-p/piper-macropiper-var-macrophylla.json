    "intro": "Piper macropiper var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn from green to yellow when mature. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in warm climates. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
