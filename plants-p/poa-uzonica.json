    "intro": "Poa uzonica, commonly known as the Uzonic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that often forms dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually erect and slightly drooping. Poa uzonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
