    "intro": "Pseudoplantago friesii, commonly known as the Fries' false plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
