    "intro": "Polypodium stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shady gardens."
