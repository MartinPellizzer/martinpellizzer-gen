It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. This subspecies is endemic to specific areas in the Carpathian Mountains, making it a rare and ecologically significant plant."
