    "intro": "Panicum segetale, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a grass species native to the warmer regions of the Old World. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant is an annual herb that grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are small and typically yellow or brown, and they are enclosed in a protective husk. Panicum segetale is adapted to dry and arid conditions, making it a hardy crop in many parts of the world."
