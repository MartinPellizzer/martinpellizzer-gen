    "intro": "Peyritschia divaricata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Peyritschia divaricata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, desert environments."
