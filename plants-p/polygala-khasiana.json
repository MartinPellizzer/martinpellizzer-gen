    "intro": "Polygala khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi polygala, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
