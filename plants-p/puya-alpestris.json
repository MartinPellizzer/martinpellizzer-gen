    "intro": "Puya alpestris, commonly known as the alpine puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Puya alpestris is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry climates with well-drained soil."
