    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma woytkowskii, commonly known as the Woytkowski's false lichen, is a unique lichen-forming fungus that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is notable for its lecanorine thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, primarily Trebouxia species, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. Its distribution is primarily in temperate regions, where it thrives on rock surfaces and tree bark. Due to its specialized habitat and limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
