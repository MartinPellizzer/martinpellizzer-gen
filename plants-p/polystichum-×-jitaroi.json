    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 jitaroi, commonly known as the hybrid Christmas fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance in winter. The fronds are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and are arranged in a compact, upright cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
