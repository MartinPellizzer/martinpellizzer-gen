It is characterized by its complex, branched spadix structure, which is typical of the Araceae family. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered around the spadix, with the female flowers located at the base and the male flowers above. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
