    "intro": "Podophyllum trilobulum, commonly known as the three-lobed buckbean, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
