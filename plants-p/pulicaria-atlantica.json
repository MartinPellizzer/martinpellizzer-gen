It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features grayish-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small yellow flowers bloom in early spring, producing a distinctive, compact inflorescence. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments."
