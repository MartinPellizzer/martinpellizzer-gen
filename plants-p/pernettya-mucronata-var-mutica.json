    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. mutica, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and North America. It produces small, dark red berries that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its cold, moist habitat. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
