    "intro": "Prevostea poggei, commonly known as the Boggy Bolete, is a species of bolete mushroom found in wet, forested areas. It is characterized by its pale yellow cap that often turns reddish-brown with age, and a thick, white to pale yellow stem. The pores of Prevostea poggei are yellow and do not change color when bruised, a key identifying feature. It typically grows in association with coniferous trees, particularly in temperate regions. This mushroom is edible but is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance and habitat preferences."
