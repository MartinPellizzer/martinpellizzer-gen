    "intro": "Phyllodes aemula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, rounded seeds. Phyllodes aemula is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
