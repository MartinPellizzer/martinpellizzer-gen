    "intro": "Pyrus kaganensis, commonly known as the Kagan pear, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pyrus. It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its deciduous nature and ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
