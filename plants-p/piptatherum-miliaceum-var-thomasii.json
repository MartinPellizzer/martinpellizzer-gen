    "intro": "Piptatherum miliaceum var. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's millet, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, oval-shaped grains that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential candidate for agricultural use in dry regions."
