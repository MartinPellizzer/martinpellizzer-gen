    "intro": "Pagaea ramosissima, commonly known as the branched sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Corallimorpharia. It is characterized by its dense, branching polyp structure that resembles a coral-like form. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, often found on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its vibrant coloration, typically ranging from orange to red, helps in attracting symbiotic algae. Pagaea ramosissima plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to reef biodiversity."
