    "intro": "Pistia brasiliensis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can grow densely, forming mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Pistia brasiliensis is often used in ornamental ponds but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
