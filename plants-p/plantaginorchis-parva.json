    "intro": "Plantaginorchis parva, commonly known as the small plantain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
