    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows."
