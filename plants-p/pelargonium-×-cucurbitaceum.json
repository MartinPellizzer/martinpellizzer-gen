    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 cucurbitaceum, commonly known as the hybrid geranium, is a cross between a pelargonium and a cucurbit species. It exhibits characteristics of both parents, with the pelargonium contributing its ornamental foliage and the cucurbit offering traits like vine-like growth habits. This plant typically has lobed leaves and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and adaptability to various garden settings."
