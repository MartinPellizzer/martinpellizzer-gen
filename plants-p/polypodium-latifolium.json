    "intro": "Polypodium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, arching fronds with lance-shaped, bright green leaves that have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium latifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
