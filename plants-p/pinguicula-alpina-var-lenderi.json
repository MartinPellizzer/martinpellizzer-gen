    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina var. lenderi, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It possesses small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or moist, shaded environments, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in cold climates and its unique adaptation to nutrient scarcity."
