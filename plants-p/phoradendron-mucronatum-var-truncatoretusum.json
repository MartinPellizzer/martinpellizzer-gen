    "intro": "Phoradendron mucronatum var. truncatoretusum, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important subject in the study of parasitic plant ecology."
