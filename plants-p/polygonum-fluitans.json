    "intro": "Polygonum fluitans, commonly known as water spinach or river spinach, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, with its rhizomes spreading along the surface. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, followed by reddish, inflated fruits. Polygonum fluitans is valued for its edible leaves and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
