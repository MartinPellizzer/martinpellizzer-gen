    "intro": "Polystichum consimile, commonly known as the similar holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum consimile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
