It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in gardens with similar conditions."
