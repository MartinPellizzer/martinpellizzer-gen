    "intro": "Populus fremontii var. macrodisca, commonly known as the Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a cotton-like covering, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to arid environments with periodic flooding. Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
