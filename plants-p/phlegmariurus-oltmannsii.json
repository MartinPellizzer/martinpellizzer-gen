It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to blackish-green foliage. The leaves are typically elongated, with a distinct midrib and a gradually tapering shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood. This moss is notable for its ability to retain water, making it an important component of microhabitats in temperate and boreal regions."
