    "intro": "Phyllodes sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran phyllodine, is a species of acacia native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flattened leaf stalks called phyllodes, which function as photosynthetic organs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, globular inflorescences."
