It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
