    "intro": "Plantago irrigua, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often coated with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
