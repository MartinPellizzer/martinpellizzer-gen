    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. engadinensis, commonly known as the Engadine Scots pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely arranged than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are typically smaller and more compact, and the tree exhibits a distinct, often stunted growth form due to its high-altitude habitat. This variety is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
