    "intro": "Polygala triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white inflorescences that are often mistaken for milkweed due to their appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Polygala triflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
