    "intro": "Prosopis torquata, commonly known as the bluebrush acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and clusters of small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by long, flat pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
