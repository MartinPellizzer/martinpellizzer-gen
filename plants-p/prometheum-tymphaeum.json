    "intro": "Prometheum tymphaeum, commonly known as the Flamebloom, is a striking flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange petals, which resemble flames and emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil and requires high levels of sunlight and warmth. Its unique structure includes a tall, slender stem with clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and moths. Prometheum tymphaeum is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, waxy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
