    "intro": "Pleconax conica subsp. coniflora, commonly known as the conical pleconax, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique conical shape and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
