    "intro": "Pachycarpus albens, commonly known as the white-barked tree, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, cork-like bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. The tree is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental bark and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
