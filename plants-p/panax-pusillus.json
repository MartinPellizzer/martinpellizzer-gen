    "intro": "Panax pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf ginseng, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Panax pusillus is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its larger relatives like Panax ginseng. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
