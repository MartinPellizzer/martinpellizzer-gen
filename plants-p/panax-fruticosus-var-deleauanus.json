    "intro": "Panax fruticosus var. deleauanus, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody, branched root system and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing oval seeds. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though its use is less widespread compared to other ginseng species. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
