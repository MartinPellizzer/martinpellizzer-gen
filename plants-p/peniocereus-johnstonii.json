    "intro": "Peniocereus johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the deserts of Baja California and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant with a short, thick stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The flowers are typically tubular and open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
