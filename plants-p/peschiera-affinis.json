    "intro": "Peschiera affinis, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features a slender, erect stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a spike, with three sepals and three petals, typical of orchids. Peschiera affinis is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland habitats."
