    "intro": "Pleopeltis glabra, commonly known as the smooth pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
