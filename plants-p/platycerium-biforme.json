    "intro": "Platycerium biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the rhizome, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. Its fronds are divided into two lobes, which are used for photosynthesis and water absorption. Platycerium biforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
