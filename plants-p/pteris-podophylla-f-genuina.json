    "intro": "Pteris podophylla f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity. The plant features small, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and have a finely divided structure. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its compact size and ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
