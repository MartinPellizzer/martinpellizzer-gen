    "intro": "Pandanus semiarmatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are followed by triangular, spiny fruits. It thrives in coastal and wetland areas, often growing in saline or brackish soils. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
