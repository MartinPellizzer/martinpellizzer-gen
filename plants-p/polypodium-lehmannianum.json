    "intro": "Polypodium lehmannianum, commonly known as the lehmann's holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
