    "intro": "Priva angolensis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Priva angolensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
