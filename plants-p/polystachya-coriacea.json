    "intro": "Polystachya coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leafed ginger, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its stiff, coriaceous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitats. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
