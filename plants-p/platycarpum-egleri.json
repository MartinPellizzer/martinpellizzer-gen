    "intro": "Platycarpum egleri, commonly known as the Egler's flat-seeded plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
