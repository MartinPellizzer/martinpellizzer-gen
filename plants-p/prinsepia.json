    "intro": "Prinsepia, commonly known as the \"Chinese snowberry,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, often followed by small, red or orange berries. Prinsepia species typically have alternate, simple leaves and are often found in forested or mountainous areas. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
