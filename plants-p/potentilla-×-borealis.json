    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 borealis, commonly known as the Arctic potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant properties make it well-suited for alpine and tundra ecosystems. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potentilla fruticosa and Potentilla anglica."
