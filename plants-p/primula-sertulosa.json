    "intro": "Primula sertulosa, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing numerous flowers that are arranged in a dense, rosette-like formation. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Primula sertulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, moist environments."
