    "intro": "Plantago floccosa, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in dense, soft, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces erect flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
