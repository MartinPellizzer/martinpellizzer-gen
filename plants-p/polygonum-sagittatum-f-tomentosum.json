    "intro": "Polygonum sagittatum f. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly arrow-leaved smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped, arrow-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common wetland plant."
