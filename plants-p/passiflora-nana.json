    "intro": "Passiflora nana, commonly known as the dwarf passionflower, is a compact perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of striking, coral-pink flowers with intricate, layered structures. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. Passiflora nana is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential calming properties."
