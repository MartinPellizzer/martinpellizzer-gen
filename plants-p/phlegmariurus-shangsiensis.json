    "intro": "Phlegmariurus shangsiensis, commonly known as the Shangsi spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
