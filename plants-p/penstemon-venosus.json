    "intro": "Penstemon venosus, commonly known as the veiny beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive veining pattern, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant gardens. This species is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bumblebees and hummingbirds."
