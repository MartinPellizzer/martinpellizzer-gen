    "intro": "Pitcairnia azouryi, commonly known as the Purple Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and green rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating, which help in water retention. Pitcairnia azouryi is well-suited for shaded environments and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value."
