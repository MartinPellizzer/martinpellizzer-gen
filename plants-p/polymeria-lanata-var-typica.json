    "intro": "Polymeria lanata var. typica, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are composed of many small, rayless florets that form a composite head. Polymeria lanata var. typica is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
