    "intro": "Platystele gaileana, commonly known as the Gailean ghost plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at protecting its unique botanical features."
