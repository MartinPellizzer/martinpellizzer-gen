    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a short-lived annual herb native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in small, fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and is known for its edible leaves and seeds."
