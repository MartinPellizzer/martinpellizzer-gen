    "intro": "Pavonia aschersonioides, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pavonia aschersonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
