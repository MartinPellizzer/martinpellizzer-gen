    "intro": "Piper incanum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-winged berries. The dried and ground fruits are used as a spice, similar to black pepper, though it has a milder flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties."
