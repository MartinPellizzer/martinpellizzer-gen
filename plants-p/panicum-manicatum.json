    "intro": "Panicum manicatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or nutrient-poor. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are typically golden or brown in color, which are a key feature in its identification. Switchgrass is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of biomass for renewable energy. Its adaptability and ecological benefits make it an important species in both landscaping and conservation efforts."
