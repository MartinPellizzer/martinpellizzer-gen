    "intro": "Prismatomeris henryi, commonly known as the Henry's prismatomeris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
