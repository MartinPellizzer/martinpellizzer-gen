    "intro": "Peperomia asperula, commonly known as the rough peperomia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Piperaceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia asperula is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it an easy plant to maintain."
