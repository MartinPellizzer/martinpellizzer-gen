    "intro": "Parapholis pycnantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Parapholis pycnantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
