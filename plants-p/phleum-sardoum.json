    "intro": "Phleum sardoum, commonly known as Sardinian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Phleum sardoum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
