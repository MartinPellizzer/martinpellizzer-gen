    "intro": "Poa annua var. supina, commonly known as the prostrate annual bluegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit, with stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. This variety is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its fine texture and rapid growth."
