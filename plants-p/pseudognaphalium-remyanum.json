    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium remyanum, commonly known as the hairy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudognaphalium remyanum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
