    "intro": "Pyrolirion tarahuasicum, commonly known as the Tarahuasi lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
