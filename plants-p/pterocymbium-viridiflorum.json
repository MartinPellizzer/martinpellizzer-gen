    "intro": "Pterocymbium viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered pterocymbium, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with vivid green petals and sepals, which contrast with its pale yellow or white lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
