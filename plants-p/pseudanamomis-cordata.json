    "intro": "Pseudanamomis cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved fern, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped fronds, which give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are delicate and can grow up to several feet in length, with a feathery structure that distinguishes it from other fern species. The botanical features of Pseudanamomis cordata make it a sought-after plant for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
