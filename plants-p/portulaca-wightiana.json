    "intro": "Portulaca wightiana, commonly known as the Indian moss or desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of India and Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its fleshy, thick leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Portulaca wightiana is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
