    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. pleniflora, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces abundant clusters of yellow flowers throughout the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
