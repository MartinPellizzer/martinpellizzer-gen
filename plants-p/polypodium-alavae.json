    "intro": "Polypodium alavae, commonly known as the Alava fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky or forested areas, often in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polypodium alavae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
