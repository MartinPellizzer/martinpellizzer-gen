    "intro": "Pleioluma tchingouensis, commonly known as the Tchingou bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
