    "intro": "Parosela albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Parosela albiflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
