    "intro": "Premna oblongata var. puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy premna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of short, soft hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
