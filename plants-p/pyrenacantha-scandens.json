    "intro": "Pyrenacantha scandens, commonly known as the climbing pyrenacantha, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
