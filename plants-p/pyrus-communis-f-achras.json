It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical pear species. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation."
