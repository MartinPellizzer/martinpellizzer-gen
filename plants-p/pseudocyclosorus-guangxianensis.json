It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
