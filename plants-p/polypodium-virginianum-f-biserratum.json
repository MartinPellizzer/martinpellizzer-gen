    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. biserratum, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that is more pronounced in this form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
