    "intro": "Panicum huachucae, commonly known as the Huachuca grass, is a native plant of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Panicum huachucae is often found in rocky slopes and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
