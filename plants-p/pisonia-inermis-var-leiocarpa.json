It is characterized by its showy, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
