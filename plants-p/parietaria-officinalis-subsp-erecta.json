    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis subsp. erecta, commonly known as wall lettuce or marsh cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in damp woodlands. Its leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
