    "intro": "Polypodium stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color, often featuring a distinctive, rough-surfaced appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
