    "intro": "Phreatia subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Phreatia subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
