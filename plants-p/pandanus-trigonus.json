It is characterized by its sword-shaped, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional thatching and basket weaving. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its roots and leaves are also used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Pandanus trigonus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing near coastal areas or in humid lowland forests."
