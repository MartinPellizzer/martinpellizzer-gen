    "intro": "Phacocapnos burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces blue to violet flowers that are clustered in racemes, which attract various pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
