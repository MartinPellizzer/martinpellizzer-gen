    "intro": "Phegopteris heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarp polypody, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or division."
