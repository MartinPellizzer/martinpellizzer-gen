    "intro": "Pyrethrum semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain the natural insecticidal compounds known as pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable source for organic pest control. Pyrethrum semenovii typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates."
