    "intro": "Phalaenopsis thorntonii, commonly known as the Thornton's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendulous flower spikes that bear multiple blooms, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for indoor gardening."
