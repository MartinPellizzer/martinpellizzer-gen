    "intro": "Psychotria diversicolor, commonly known as the rainbow psychotria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly colorful, tubular flowers that range from red to violet. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, though it is not as well-known for its hallucinogenic properties as other species in the Psychotria genus."
