    "intro": "Pircunia esculenta, commonly known as the edible nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white. The plant bears round, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds in their raw state. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, caution is necessary when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
