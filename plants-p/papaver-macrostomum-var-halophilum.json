    "intro": "Papaver macrostomum var. halophilum, commonly known as the salt-loving poppy, is a variant of the broad-mouthed poppy. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange. This plant thrives in saline environments, such as coastal areas and salt marshes, due to its adaptations to high salinity. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation in arid and saline habitats."
