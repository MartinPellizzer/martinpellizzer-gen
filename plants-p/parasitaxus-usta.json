    "intro": "Parasitaxus usta, commonly known as the Indian yew, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant has a distinctive appearance with scale-like leaves and small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is considered a living fossil due to its primitive features and limited distribution. Despite its ecological significance, it is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
