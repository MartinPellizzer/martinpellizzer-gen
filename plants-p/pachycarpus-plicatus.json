    "intro": "Pachycarpus plicatus, commonly known as the pleated pachycarpus, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often pleated or folded, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical environments."
