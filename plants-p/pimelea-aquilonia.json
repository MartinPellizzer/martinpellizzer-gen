    "intro": "Pimelea aquilonia, commonly known as the mountain banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are primarily pollinated by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Pimelea aquilonia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
