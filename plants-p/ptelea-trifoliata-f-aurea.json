    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata f. aurea, commonly known as the goldenleaf sand cherry, is a variant of the sand cherry species native to the western United States. This plant is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique coloration. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
