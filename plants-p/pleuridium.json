    "intro": "Pleuridium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often intricately veined leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Pleuridium species are usually found in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or shaded forest floors, where they thrive in humid conditions. Their rhizomes are often short and creeping, allowing them to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are typically clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among ferns."
