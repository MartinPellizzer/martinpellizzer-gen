    "intro": "Pachysa glomiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. Pachysa glomiflora is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
