    "intro": "Paspalidium johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalidium johnsonii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
