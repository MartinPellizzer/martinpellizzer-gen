    "intro": "Poa frankii, commonly known as Frank's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to damp conditions. Poa frankii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its environmental adaptability."
