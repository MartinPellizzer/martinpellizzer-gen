    "intro": "Polybotrya alfredii f. carpinterae, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a rare and unique variant of the tree fern genus Polybotrya. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, slender fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
