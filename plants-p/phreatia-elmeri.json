    "intro": "Phreatia elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a prominent lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Phreatia elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
