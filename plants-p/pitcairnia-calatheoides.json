    "intro": "Pitcairnia calatheoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that resembles a velvety curtain, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
