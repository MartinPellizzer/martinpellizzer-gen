    "intro": "Pneumatopteris deficiens, commonly known as the deficient maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-green in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns and aid in spore dispersal. Pneumatopteris deficiens prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
