    "intro": "Parodia rigida, commonly known as the rigid pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are covered in dense, white spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched peduncles. Parodia rigida is a slow-growing, columnar cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. It is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
