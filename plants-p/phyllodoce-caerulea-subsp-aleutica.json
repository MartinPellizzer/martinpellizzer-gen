    "intro": "Phyllodoce caerulea subsp. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian mountain moss, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh, coastal habitats."
