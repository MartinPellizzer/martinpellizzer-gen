It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its remote habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
