It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, globe-shaped blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
