It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves, which are usually evergreen. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Phyllanthera species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
