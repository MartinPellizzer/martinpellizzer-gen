    "intro": "Pteris regia, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elegantly fronded leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. Pteris regia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests."
