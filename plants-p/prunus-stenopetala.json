    "intro": "Prunus stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high altitudes. Prunus stenopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
