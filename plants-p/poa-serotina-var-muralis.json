It typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found on walls, banks, and pathways. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
