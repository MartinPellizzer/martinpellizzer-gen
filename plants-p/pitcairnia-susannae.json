    "intro": "Pitcairnia susannae, commonly known as the Susanna's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pitcairnia susannae is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
