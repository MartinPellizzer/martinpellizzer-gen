    "intro": "Primula carniolica var. multiceps, commonly known as the Carniolan primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Primulaceae family, which includes many ornamental and ecologically important species."
