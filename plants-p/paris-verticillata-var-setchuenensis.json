    "intro": "Paris verticillata var. setchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese basket lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, white spadix surrounded by a green, petal-like spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
