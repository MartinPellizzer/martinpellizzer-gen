    "intro": "Praecereus euchlorus subsp. jaenensis, commonly known as the Jaenensis Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water to survive."
