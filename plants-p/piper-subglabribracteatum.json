    "intro": "Piper subglabribracteatum, commonly known as the smooth-bract pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, climbing vines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a mild, peppery aroma."
