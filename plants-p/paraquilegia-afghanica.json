    "intro": "Paraquilegia afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to Afghanistan and surrounding regions. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor soil conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge to agricultural crops it infests."
