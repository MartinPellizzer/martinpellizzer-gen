    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa var. multiplexa, commonly known as the clustered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, multi-branched structure and small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark red to black berries in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils. The species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
