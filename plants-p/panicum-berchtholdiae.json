    "intro": "Panicum berchtholdiae, commonly known as the Berchthold's grass, is a rare and endangered species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
