    "intro": "Plexaure dendrophylax, commonly known as the tree-attached sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in shallow tropical waters. It has a branching, tree-like structure with elongated, flexible polyps that resemble small, delicate fingers. The coral's coloration can vary, often appearing in shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the environment. It thrives in clear, warm waters and is often found attached to submerged structures such as rocks or artificial reefs. This species plays an important role in coral reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
