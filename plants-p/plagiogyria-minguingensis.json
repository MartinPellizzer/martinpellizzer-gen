It belongs to the family Plagiogyriaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the humid and cool conditions. Its botanical features include small, clustered leaves and a short, creeping stem structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
