    "intro": "Phyllanthus fluggeoides, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine."
