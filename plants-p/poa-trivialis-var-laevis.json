    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, sod-forming vegetation that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface, distinguishing it from other varieties of Poa trivialis. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in lawns, meadows, and along the edges of wetlands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
