    "intro": "Pteris lonchitoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris lonchitoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in water gardens."
