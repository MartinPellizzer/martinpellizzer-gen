    "intro": "Pellionia nigrescens, commonly known as black-leaved pellionia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that turn dark green to almost black as they mature. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Pellionia nigrescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it is not widely cultivated."
