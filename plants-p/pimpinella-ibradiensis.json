    "intro": "Pimpinella ibradiensis, commonly known as the Alpine Butterbur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial life cycle. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
