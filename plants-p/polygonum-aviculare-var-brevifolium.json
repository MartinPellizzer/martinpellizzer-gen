    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
