    "intro": "Pellionia subpeltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf pellionia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
