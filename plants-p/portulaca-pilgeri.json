    "intro": "Portulaca pilgeri, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Portulaca pilgeri is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
