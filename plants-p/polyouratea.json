    "intro": "Polyouratea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have large, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a silvery appearance. They produce small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and their fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Polyouratea species are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ecological significance."
