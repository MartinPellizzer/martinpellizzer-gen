    "intro": "Patrisa pyrifera, commonly known as the flame leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often red or orange in color, giving it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
