    "intro": "Pouteria buluensis, commonly known as the Bulu's pouteria, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits with a thick, waxy peel. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a sweet, sticky pulp, which is often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Pouteria buluensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
