    "intro": "Physalis mollis var. variovestita, commonly known as the golden berry or Cape gooseberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive lantern-shaped fruits. The fruits are encased in a papery calyx that turns red or orange as they ripen. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, which have a sweet-tart flavor."
