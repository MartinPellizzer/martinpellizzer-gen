    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 permixta, commonly known as the hybrid cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bright yellow flowers. It is a natural hybrid between Potentilla fruticosa and Potentilla nepalensis, resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits from both parents. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to lance-shaped and have serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
