    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils."
