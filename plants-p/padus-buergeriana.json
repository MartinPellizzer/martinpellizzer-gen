    "intro": "Padus buergeriana, commonly known as the Chinese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Padus buergeriana thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
