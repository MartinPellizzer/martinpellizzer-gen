    "intro": "Piper trioicum, commonly known as the three-leaved pepper or triole, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in traditional medicine. The botanical features of Piper trioicum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
