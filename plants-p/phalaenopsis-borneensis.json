    "intro": "Phalaenopsis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean moth orchid, is a species of orchid native to Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a velvety texture. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
