    "intro": "Penstemon brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that split open to release its small, dry seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Penstemon brevilabris is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
