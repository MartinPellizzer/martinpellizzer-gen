It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with prominent veins, often displaying variegation in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
