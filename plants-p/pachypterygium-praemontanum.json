    "intro": "Pachypterygium praemontanum, commonly known as the mountain mist fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to steep, rocky surfaces. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
