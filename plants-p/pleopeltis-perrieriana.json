    "intro": "Pleopeltis perrieriana, commonly known as the Perrier's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a rhizome that is covered in a thick layer of brownish, velvety tissue, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Pleopeltis perrieriana is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
