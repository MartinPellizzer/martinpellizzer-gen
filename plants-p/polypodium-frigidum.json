    "intro": "Polypodium frigidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky or soil-covered areas. Its fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, pinnate structure. Polypodium frigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardy nature."
