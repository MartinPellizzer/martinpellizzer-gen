    "intro": "Pentaglottis sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen pentaglottis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
