    "intro": "Piscidia toxicaria, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is known for its poisonous properties. The tree plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
