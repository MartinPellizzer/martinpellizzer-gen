    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 tulcensis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
