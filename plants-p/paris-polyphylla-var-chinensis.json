    "intro": "Paris polyphylla var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese white snake-root, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. It has a rhizomatous root system and possesses toxic compounds, including protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is necessary due to its toxicity."
