    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. brachychaetophora, commonly known as the narrow-haired mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are typically narrow and hairy. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale purple ray florets. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
