    "intro": "Poa asthenes, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa asthenes produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination."
