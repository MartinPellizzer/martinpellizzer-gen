    "intro": "Pyracantha mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by the bright berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and seasonal color. The species is also valued for its ability to attract birds and its role in traditional medicine."
