    "intro": "Plantago sarda var. alpinoides, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. This variety is closely related to other plantain species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific habitat preferences."
