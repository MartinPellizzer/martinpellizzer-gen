    "intro": "Podostemum ceratophyllum f. chondroides, commonly known as the rock moss or stone fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized morphology. It typically grows in fast-flowing, shallow streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks using its rhizomes. The plant features small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes that are adapted for photosynthesis in water. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female organs, and are often borne on short stalks. This fern-like plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky habitats."
