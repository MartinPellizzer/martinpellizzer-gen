    "intro": "Phacelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a valuable species for ecological studies."
