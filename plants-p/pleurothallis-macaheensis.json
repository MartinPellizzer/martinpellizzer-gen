    "intro": "Pleurothallis macaheensis, commonly known as the Macaheen's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, intricate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are borne on short, curved pedicels, and the orchid has a delicate, sympodial structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
