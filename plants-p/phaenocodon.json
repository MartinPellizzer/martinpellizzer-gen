It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall, branching stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Phaenocodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
