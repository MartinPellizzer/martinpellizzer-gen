    "intro": "Polypodium pycnosorum, commonly known as the thick-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like growth, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock faces. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are found on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal in its natural habitat."
