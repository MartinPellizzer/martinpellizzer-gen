    "intro": "Pitcairnia incarnata, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red bracts that surround a central spadix, giving it an eye-catching appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pitcairnia incarnata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
