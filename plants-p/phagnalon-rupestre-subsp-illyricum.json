    "intro": "Phagnalon rupestre subsp. illyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features erect, branched stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the summer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
