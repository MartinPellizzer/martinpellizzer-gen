    "intro": "Pelargonium crithmifolium, commonly known as the sea holly geranium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to coastal gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in mild maritime climates."
