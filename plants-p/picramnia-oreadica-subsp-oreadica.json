It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release small seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
