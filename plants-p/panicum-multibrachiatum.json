    "intro": "Panicum multibrachiatum, commonly known as the many-branched panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often hairy and can vary in color from green to brown. Its leaves are narrow and rolled in the bud, with a rough, textured surface. Panicum multibrachiatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
