    "intro": "Polygala andicola, commonly known as the Andean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Polygala andicola is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
