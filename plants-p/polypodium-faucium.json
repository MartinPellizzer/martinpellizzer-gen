    "intro": "Polypodium faucium, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium faucium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
