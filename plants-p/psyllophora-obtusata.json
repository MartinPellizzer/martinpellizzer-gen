    "intro": "Psyllophora obtusata, commonly known as the obtuse psyllid, is a small insect belonging to the family Psyllidae, often referred to as plant lice. It is primarily found in the Mediterranean region and is known for its unique feeding habits on specific host plants. The adult psyllid has a distinctive, flattened body covered in fine, waxy secretions that provide protection. Its larvae feed on the sap of its host plants, causing minor damage that can affect plant growth. The life cycle of Psyllophora obtusata includes several developmental stages, with overwintering typically occurring as eggs or nymphs."
