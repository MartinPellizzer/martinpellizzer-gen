    "intro": "Polypodium rigescens, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme dehydration. It typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The plant's fronds are evergreen and can curl into a tight spiral when dry, allowing it to \"resurrect\" when water becomes available. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
