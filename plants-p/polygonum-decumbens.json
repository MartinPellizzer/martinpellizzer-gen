    "intro": "Polygonum decumbens, commonly known as creeping smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. The plant has prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red. The species is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator of wet soil conditions."
