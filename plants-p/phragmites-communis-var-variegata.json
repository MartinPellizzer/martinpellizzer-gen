    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated common reed, is a variant of the common reed characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and tidal flats. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are usually lighter in color than those of the standard Phragmites communis, featuring a mix of green and white or yellow markings. This variant is often cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
