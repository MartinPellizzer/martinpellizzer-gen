    "intro": "Pasina pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or violet in color. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine pubescence. Pasina pyrenaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
