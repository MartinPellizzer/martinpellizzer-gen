It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it an ideal plant for bonsai and tabletop displays."
