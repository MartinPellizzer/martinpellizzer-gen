    "intro": "Psammotropha obovata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor the plant in sandy soils while accessing deep water sources. Psammotropha obovata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions."
