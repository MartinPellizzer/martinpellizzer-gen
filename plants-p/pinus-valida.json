    "intro": "Pinus valida, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling crown and scaly bark that becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces edible seeds called pine nuts, which are enclosed in woody cones. It thrives in high-elevation environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones. Pinus valida plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
