    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It features compact, spreading growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to dry, sunny landscapes."
