    "intro": "Potentilla nevadensis subsp. condensata, commonly known as the Sierra plum or Sierra potentilla, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high elevation. This subspecies is adapted to cold, arid environments and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
