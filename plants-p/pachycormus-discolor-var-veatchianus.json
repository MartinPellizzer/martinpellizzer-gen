    "intro": "Pachycormus discolor var. veatchianus, commonly known as the Veatch's bitterroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-white flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
