    "intro": "Psychrophyton eximium, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a flowering plant native to the extreme northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Psychrophyton eximium plays a vital role in the ecological balance of Arctic tundra ecosystems."
