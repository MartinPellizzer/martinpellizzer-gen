    "intro": "Pittosporum undulatum subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in New Zealand's native flora."
