It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
