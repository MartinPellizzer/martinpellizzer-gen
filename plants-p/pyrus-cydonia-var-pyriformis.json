It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 4\u20136 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves and yellowish-green flowers in spring. The fruit is distinctive, with a rough, warty skin and a sweet, juicy flesh that is often used in jams and preserves. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy choice for cultivation in such regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
