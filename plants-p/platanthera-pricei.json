It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.
