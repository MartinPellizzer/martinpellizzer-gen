    "intro": "Pithecellobium laetum, commonly known as the golden pod tree, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in reforestation efforts due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
