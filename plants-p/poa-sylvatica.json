    "intro": "Poa sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist, woodland habitats."
