    "intro": "Polypodium nutans, commonly known as the nodding polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive nodding appearance due to the way the fronds curve downward. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
