It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to dry environments include reduced leaf size and the ability to store water in its stems. The species is also noted for its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
