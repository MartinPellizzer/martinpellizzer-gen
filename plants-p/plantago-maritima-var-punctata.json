    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. punctata, commonly known as the dotted plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish dot pattern along the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shorelines, often in salt-tolerant environments. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
