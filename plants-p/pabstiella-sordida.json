    "intro": "Pabstiella sordida, commonly known as the sordid pabstiella, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Pezizales order. It is a saprobic fungus that typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The fruiting body is small, with a leathery cap that ranges in color from gray to brown, and it often has a distinct, irregular shape. It is found in temperate regions, especially in areas with high humidity and abundant organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and subtle appearance, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
