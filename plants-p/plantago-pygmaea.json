It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spike, with inconspicuous petals that are usually green or brown. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
