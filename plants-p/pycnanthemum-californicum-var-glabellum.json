    "intro": "Pycnanthemum californicum var. glabellum, commonly known as California mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a minty scent, and its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in dense terminal clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the variety glabellum has reduced hair compared to other forms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
