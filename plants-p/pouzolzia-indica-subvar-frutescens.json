    "intro": "Pouzolzia indica subvar. frutescens, commonly known as the Indian pouzolzia, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, often branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
