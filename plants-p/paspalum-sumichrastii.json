    "intro": "Paspalum sumichrastii, commonly known as the Mexican grass or narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Paspalum sumichrastii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
