    "intro": "Pinus galocote, commonly known as the Galocote pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Pinus galocote is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
