It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in lakes and ponds."
