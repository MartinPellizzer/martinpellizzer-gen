It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a soft, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine settings."
