    "intro": "Phacelia heterophylla var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from basal rosettes to alternate or opposite arrangements. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
