    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with glandular dots along the midrib, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, bright red berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
