    "intro": "Palicourea osaensis, commonly known as the Osa mountain beauty, is a flowering plant native to the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palicourea osaensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
