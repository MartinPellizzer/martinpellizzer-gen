    "intro": "Phyllodes trifasciata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
