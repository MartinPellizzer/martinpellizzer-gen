    "intro": "Ptychosperma wendlandianum var. sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the spherical cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family characterized by its distinctive, spherical seed cones. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a rough, fibrous bark and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. Its reproductive structures are notable for their compact, globular shape, which sets it apart from other cycad species. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
