    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 babadagensis, commonly known as the Babadag pear, is a hybrid species within the genus Pyrus, native to Turkey. It is characterized by its medium-sized, sweet, and juicy fruits with a distinctive yellowish-orange color. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with broad, lobed leaves and a tendency to produce clusters of small, white flowers in spring. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of other pear cultivars, contributing to genetic diversity in cultivated pears. The fruit is often used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications due to its favorable taste and texture."
