    "intro": "Pectis bibracteata, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its floral structure consists of bracteate inflorescences, which are modified leaves that encase the flowers. Pectis bibracteata is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
