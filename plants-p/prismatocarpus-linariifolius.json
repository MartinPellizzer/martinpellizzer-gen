    "intro": "Prismatocarpus linariifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sago, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
