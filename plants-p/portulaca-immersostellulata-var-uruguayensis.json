    "intro": "Portulaca immersostellulata var. uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay moss rose, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
