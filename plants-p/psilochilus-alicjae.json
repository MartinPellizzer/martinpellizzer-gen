    "intro": "Psilochilus alicjae, commonly known as the Alice's psilochilus, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
