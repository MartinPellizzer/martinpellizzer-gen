    "intro": "Phlomis rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and large, woolly, round leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of purple or pink flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and coastal areas. Phlomis rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
