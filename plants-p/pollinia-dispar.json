    "intro": "Pollinia dispar, commonly known as the false orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which consists of a single, elongated flower with a specialized pollination mechanism. The plant produces pollinia, which are clumps of pollen that are transferred en masse to the stigma of other flowers. These pollinia are often attached to specialized structures called viscid discs, which aid in their adhesion to pollinators. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, Pollinia dispar is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
