    "intro": "Platanthera saprophytica, commonly known as the saprophytic lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is found in moist, shaded forest habitats, typically in areas with rich organic soil. The plant produces a dense, dark green to brownish inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale green flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
