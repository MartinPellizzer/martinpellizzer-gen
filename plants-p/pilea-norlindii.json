    "intro": "Pilea norlindii, commonly known as the Norlind's pilea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, rounded foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are slightly notched at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea norlindii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
