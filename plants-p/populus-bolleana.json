    "intro": "Populus bolleana, commonly known as the Bolleana poplar, is a species of poplar native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted and contorted growth habit, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and paler beneath. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Populus bolleana is relatively rare and is often found in moist, temperate forest environments."
