    "intro": "Pavetta megistocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered pavetta, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its flowers are showy, with large, white petals that are often spotted with purple or red. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
