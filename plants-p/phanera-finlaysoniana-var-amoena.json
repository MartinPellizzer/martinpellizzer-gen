    "intro": "Phanera finlaysoniana var. amoena, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the limestone forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to reddish-brown pseudobulbs and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of pink and white. It is epiphytic, growing on tree trunks and branches without soil, and requires high humidity and specific light conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in the wild."
