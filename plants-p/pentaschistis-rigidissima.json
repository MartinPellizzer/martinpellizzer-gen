It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often cultivated in botanical gardens."
