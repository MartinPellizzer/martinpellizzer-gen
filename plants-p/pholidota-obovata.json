    "intro": "Pholidota obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pholidota, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its simple, obovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pholidota obovata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
