    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subsp. tommasiniana, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where it forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization."
