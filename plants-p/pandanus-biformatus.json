    "intro": "Pandanus biformatus, commonly known as the double-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that often grow in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. These flowers are followed by spadices, which are clustered inflorescences that contain the true flowers. Pandanus biformatus is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
