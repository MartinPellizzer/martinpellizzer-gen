    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Serbian pine, is a variety of the black pine species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical black pine. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
