    "intro": "Picrodendron juglans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal regions of Australia and is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has dark, rough bark and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The black mangrove plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
