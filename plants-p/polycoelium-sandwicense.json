    "intro": "Polycoelium sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicense, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying Hawaiian flora. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
