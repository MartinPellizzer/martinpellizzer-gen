    "intro": "Pentstemonacanthus modestus, commonly known as the modest pentstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
