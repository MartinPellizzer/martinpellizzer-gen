    "intro": "Pancratium obtusatum, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its robust, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
