    "intro": "Polygonella articulata, commonly known as the jointed water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, flowing waters such as streams and rivers. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive jointed stem. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pollinated by wind. Polygonella articulata plays a role in stabilizing streambeds and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
