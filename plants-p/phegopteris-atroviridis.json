    "intro": "Phegopteris atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with prominent, blackish veins. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phegopteris atroviridis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
