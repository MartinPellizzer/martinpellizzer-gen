    "intro": "Pernettya nitida, commonly known as the slender cowberry, is a species of shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Pernettya nitida thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its low-growing habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
