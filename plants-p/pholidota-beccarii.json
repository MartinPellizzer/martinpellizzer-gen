    "intro": "Pholidota beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dark, heavy wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries old. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
