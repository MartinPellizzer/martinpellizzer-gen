    "intro": "Pleopeltis lima, commonly known as the Lima fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, white roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year of growth."
