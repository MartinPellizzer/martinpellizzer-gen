    "intro": "Potentilla lupinoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, silver-gray leaves that help reflect sunlight in cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Potentilla lupinoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
