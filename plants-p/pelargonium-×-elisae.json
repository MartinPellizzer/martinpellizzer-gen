    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 elisae, commonly known as the hybrid geranium, is a species that results from the crossbreeding of various pelargonium species.

The plant typically has a compact, bushy growth habit with serrated, dark green leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
