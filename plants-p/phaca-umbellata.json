It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has broad, strap-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phaca umbellata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
