    "intro": "Pseudobombax grandiflorum, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
