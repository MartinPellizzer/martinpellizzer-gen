    "intro": "Psychotria concinna, commonly known as the red-eyed poison dart frog, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic compounds, which are used by indigenous peoples to poison the tips of darts. Psychotria concinna thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests."
