    "intro": "Physaria recurvata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically linear and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Physaria recurvata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural and reproductive features."
