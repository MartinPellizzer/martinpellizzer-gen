    "intro": "Phleum hirsutum, commonly known as purple grass or sheep's barley, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often display a striking purple hue. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its textured appearance. Phleum hirsutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
