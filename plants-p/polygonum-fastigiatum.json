    "intro": "Polygonum fastigiatum, commonly known as the red-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features upright, reddish stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
