    "intro": "Passiflora urbaniana, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments resembling a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora urbaniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
