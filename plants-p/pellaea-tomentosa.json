    "intro": "Pellaea tomentosa, commonly known as the silky cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive grayish-white underside due to the fine, silky hairs. Pellaea tomentosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
