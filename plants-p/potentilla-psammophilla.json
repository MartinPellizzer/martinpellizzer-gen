    "intro": "Potentilla psammophilla, commonly known as sandstem cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla psammophilla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
