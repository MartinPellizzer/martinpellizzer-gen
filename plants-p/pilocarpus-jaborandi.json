It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid pilocarpine, which is primarily found in its leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its stimulant and anticholinergic effects."
