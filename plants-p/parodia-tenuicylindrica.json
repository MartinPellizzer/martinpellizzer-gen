    "intro": "Parodia tenuicylindrica, commonly known as the narrow-cylindrical cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
