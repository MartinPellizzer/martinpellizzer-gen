    "intro": "Peliosanthes sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and large, palm-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
