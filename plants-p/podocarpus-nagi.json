It has a slender, columnar form with dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and reddish-brown cones, which contain the seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.
