    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris, commonly known as the rock hound or rock fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lobes. The plant is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and often forms dense colonies, allowing it to persist in rocky or disturbed soils. The fronds are usually dark green and remain throughout the year, making it a distinctive feature in woodland habitats."
