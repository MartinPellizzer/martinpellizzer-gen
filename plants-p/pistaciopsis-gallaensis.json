    "intro": "Pistaciopsis gallaensis, commonly known as the Galician pistacia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Galicia region of Spain. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces unique, spherical fruiting bodies that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
