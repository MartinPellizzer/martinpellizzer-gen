    "intro": "Polystachya odorata subsp. trilepidis, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
