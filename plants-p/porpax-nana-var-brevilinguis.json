    "intro": "Porpax nana var. brevilinguis, commonly known as the dwarf porpax, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
