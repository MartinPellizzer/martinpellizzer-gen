    "intro": "Pauridiantha multiflora subsp. dewevrei, commonly known as the dewevrei subshrub, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
