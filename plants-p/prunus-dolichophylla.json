    "intro": "Prunus dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that give it its common name, along with its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other Prunus species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
