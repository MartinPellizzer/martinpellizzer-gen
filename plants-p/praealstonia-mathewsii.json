    "intro": "Praealstonia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' praealstonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
