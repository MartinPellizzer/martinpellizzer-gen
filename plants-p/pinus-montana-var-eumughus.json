    "intro": "Pinus montana var. eumughus, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a white or grayish inner surface. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. Its needles are long, dark green, and often grow in bundles of five, contributing to its ornamental value. This variant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in forest ecosystems where it plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
