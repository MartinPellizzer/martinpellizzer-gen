It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
