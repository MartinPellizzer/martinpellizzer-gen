    "intro": "Pollinia debilis, commonly known as the weak pollen sac orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately structured pollinia, which are specialized masses of pollen adapted for transfer by insect vectors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pollinia debilis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
