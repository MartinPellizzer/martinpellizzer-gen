    "intro": "Prunus japonica var. florepleno, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or some varieties as the double-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, double blossoms that appear in early spring, giving it a more profuse and showy display compared to single-flowered varieties. The plant produces small, oval fruits known as cherries, which are edible but typically not as flavorful as those of other Prunus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its blooming period makes it a favorite for ornamental purposes in parks and urban landscapes."
