    "intro": "Plumaria vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is introduced."
