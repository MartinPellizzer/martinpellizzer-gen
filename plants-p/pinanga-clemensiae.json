    "intro": "Pinanga clemensiae, commonly known as the Bornean arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Its underground stems, known as rhizomes, are edible and resemble those of the arrowroot plant. Pinanga clemensiae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
