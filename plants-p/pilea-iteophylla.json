    "intro": "Pilea iteophylla, commonly known as the water shield, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne on short stalks and are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Pilea iteophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
