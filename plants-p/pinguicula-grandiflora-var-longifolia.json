    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features drooping, glandular-stemmed leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity to maintain its delicate structure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized growing conditions."
