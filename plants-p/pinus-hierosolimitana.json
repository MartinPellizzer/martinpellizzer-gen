    "intro": "Pinus hierosolimitana, commonly known as the Holy Land pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Levant region. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain attached to the tree for several years. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
