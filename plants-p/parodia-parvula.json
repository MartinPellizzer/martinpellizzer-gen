    "intro": "Parodia parvula, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is a small, compact plant with a short, thick stem and a single, rounded, often brightly colored top. The plant features spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green with a reddish tint. Its flowers are small, yellow, and bloom in late spring or early summer. Parodia parvula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and requiring minimal care once established."
