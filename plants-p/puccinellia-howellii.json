    "intro": "Puccinellia howellii, commonly known as Howell's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Puccinellia howellii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
