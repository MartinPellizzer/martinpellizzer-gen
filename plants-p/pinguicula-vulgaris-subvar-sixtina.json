    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subvar. sixtina, commonly known as the Sixtina butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on slender stalks above the rosette. The subvariety is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the species."
