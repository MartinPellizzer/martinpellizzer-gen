    "intro": "Pedicularis imbricata, commonly known as the imbricate lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas with poor soil. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. The leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in harsh environments."
