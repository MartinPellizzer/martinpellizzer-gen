    "intro": "Primula longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its elongated style, which gives it its scientific name, is a distinctive feature that aids in pollination by insects. Primula longistyla is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
