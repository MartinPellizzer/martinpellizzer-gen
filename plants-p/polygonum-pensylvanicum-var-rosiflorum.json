    "intro": "Polygonum pensylvanicum var. rosiflorum, commonly known as rose-flowered smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is often mistaken for other Polygonum species due to its similar appearance but can be identified by its unique floral coloration and habitat preferences."
