    "intro": "Pogonia umbrosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate, white to pale pink flowers are typically borne on thin, wiry stems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
