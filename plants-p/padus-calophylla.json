    "intro": "Padus calophylla, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
