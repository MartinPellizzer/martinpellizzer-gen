    "intro": "Phyllocalyx herbaceus, commonly known as the creeping phyllocalyx, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is typically found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in pine flatwood habitats."
