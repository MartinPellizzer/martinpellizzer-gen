    "intro": "Potentilla bolzanensis var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
