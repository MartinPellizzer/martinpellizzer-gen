It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white or yellow spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant's structure and flowering habits reflect its adaptation to desert conditions."
