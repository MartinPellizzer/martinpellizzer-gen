    "intro": "Pectinariella pungens, commonly known as the spiked sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Pectinariella pungens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
