    "intro": "Prunus hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish cherry or the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue to black berries in the autumn. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. The plant's hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
