It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
