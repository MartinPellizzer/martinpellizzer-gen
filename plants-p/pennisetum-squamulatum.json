    "intro": "Pennisetum squamulatum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a ornamental grass native to Africa. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces fluffy, purple-pink plumes during the summer months, which add visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Pennisetum squamulatum is drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
