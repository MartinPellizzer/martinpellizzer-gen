It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant has a distinctive bark that is thick and furrowed, providing protection against environmental stress. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its cones are typically woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
