    "intro": "Platanus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. The tree produces spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, flaky, and often has a mottled appearance. Platanus mexicana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and forests."
