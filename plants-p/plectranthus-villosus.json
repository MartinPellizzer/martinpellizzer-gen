It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a valued addition to both gardens and indoor spaces."
