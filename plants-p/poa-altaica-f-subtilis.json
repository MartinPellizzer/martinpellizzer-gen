    "intro": "Poa altaica f. subtilis, commonly known as the fine-leaved alpine bluegrass, is a botanical variant of Poa altaica, characterized by its slender, finely textured leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its flowering stems are usually short and often bear small, blue-green inflorescences. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
