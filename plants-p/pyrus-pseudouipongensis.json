    "intro": "Pyrus pseudouipongensis, commonly known as the New Zealand whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
