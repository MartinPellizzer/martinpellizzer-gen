    "intro": "Pyrus autumnalis f. aestivalis, commonly known as the early-flowering whitebeam, is a decorative shrub or small tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically oval, with a glossy surface and a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil types. It is also noted for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators."
