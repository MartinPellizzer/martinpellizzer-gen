    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The varietal form, jamesonii, is distinguished by subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preference compared to the typical species."
