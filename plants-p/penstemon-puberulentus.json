    "intro": "Penstemon puberulentus, commonly known as the hairy beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon puberulentus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
