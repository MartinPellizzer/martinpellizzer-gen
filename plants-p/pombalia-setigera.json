It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
