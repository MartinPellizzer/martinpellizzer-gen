    "intro": "Physocarpus thyrsiflorus, commonly known as Ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems that exfoliate to reveal a mottled, reddish-brown surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by persistent, fuzzy, red berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Physocarpus thyrsiflorus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
