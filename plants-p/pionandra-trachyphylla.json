    "intro": "Pionandra trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved pionandra, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It features gray-green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
