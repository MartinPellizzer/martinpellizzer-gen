    "intro": "Prosthechea lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Prosthechea lindenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
