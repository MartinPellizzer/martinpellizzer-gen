    "intro": "Puya stenothyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-throat puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments with limited rainfall. Puya stenothyrsa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
