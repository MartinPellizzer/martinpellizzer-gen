    "intro": "Potentilla japonica var. quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Korean cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Korea. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant flowers and hardy nature, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the Potentilla genus."
