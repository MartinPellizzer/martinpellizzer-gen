    "intro": "Pinus istratovae, commonly known as the Istratov pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and covered in short, stiff bracts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
