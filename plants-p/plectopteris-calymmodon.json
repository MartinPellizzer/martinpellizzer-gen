    "intro": "Plectopteris calymmodon, commonly known as the broad-leafed cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, spreading segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered with a protective layer. Plectopteris calymmodon is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
