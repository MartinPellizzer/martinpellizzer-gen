    "intro": "Primula juliae, commonly known as the Alpine Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, which is a common trait among alpine species. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Primula juliae thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
