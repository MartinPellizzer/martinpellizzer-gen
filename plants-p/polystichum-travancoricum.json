    "intro": "Polystichum travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests and rocky crevices. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
