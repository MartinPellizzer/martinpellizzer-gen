    "intro": "Parnassia cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's fairy buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, cup-shaped flowers with a yellow center, which are often mistaken for those of the true buttercup. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often cool, damp habitat. Parnassia cooperi is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy and often toxic flowers."
