    "intro": "Pteris biaurita var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a subpinnatifid outline, giving it a lacy appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
