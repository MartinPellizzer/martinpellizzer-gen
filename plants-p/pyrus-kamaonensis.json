    "intro": "Pyrus kamaonensis, commonly known as the Kamaon pear, is a species of tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree bears small, clustered flowers that are white with a pinkish tinge, followed by edible pears that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
