    "intro": "Pteris lellingeri, commonly known as the Lellinger's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Pteris lellingeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
