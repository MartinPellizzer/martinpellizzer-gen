    "intro": "Pilosperma caudatum, commonly known as the hairy-tailed grass, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy inflorescence that resembles a tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Pilosperma caudatum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
