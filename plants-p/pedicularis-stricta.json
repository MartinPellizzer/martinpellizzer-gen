    "intro": "Pedicularis stricta, commonly known as the slender lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, which is a feature common among the genus Pedicularis. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
