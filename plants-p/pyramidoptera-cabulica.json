    "intro": "Pyramidoptera cabulica, commonly known as the Kabul pygmy grasshopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Pyrgoceratidae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is not a true plant but a type of grasshopper, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it plays a role in the ecosystem as a herbivorous insect that feeds on grasses and shrubs. Its presence is an indicator of the health and biodiversity of its alpine habitat."
