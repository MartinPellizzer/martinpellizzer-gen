    "intro": "Polycarpaea arenaria var. rosulans, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
