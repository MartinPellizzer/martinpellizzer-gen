    "intro": "Purgosea debilis, commonly known as the weak purgative tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional medicine for its laxative effects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
