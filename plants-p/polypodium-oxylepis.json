    "intro": "Polypodium oxylepis, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are often divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
