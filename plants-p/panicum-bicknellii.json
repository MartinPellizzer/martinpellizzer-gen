    "intro": "Panicum bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's panicgrass, is a rare grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
