    "intro": "Pedicularis physocalyx var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling those of its non-parasitic relatives. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
