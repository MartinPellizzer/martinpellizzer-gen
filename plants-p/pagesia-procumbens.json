    "intro": "Pagesia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pagesia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pagesia procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
