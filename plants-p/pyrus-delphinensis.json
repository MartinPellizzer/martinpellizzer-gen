    "intro": "Pyrus delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphin's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. This deciduous tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The fruit is a small, round pear that ripens in late summer and is edible, though not widely cultivated. It is valued for its ornamental value and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
