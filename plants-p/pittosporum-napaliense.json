    "intro": "Pittosporum napaliense, commonly known as the Napali pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
