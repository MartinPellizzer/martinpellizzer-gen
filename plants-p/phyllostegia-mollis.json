It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. Its stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Phyllostegia mollis is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
