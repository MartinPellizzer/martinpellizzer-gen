    "intro": "Petrophile adiantifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Petrophile adiantifolia is well-suited to cultivation in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
