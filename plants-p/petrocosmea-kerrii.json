    "intro": "Petrocosmea kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and dark green, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea kerrii is considered a conservation concern."
