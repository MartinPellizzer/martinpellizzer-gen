    "intro": "Paraspalathus cancellata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae arranged in a dense, compact pattern. Paraspalathus cancellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
