    "intro": "Platylepis lamellata, commonly known as the flat-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Platylepis lamellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
