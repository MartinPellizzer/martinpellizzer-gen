    "intro": "Polypodium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows on rocky outcrops, trees, and cliffs, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with narrow, lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forested habitats."
