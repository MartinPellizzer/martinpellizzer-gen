Its most notable botanical feature is its vivid, flame-like inflorescences, which display a spectrum of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. It has a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
