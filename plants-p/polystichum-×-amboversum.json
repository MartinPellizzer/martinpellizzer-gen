    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 amboversum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum polyanthum. It is a hardy, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a dark green color and a lacy, intricate structure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities. Due to its sterility, it does not produce spores and is propagated through vegetative means."
