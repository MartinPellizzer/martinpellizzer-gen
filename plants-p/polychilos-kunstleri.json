    "intro": "Polychilos kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's polychilos, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it exhibits drought tolerance. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
