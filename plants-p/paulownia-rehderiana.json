    "intro": "Paulownia rehderiana, commonly known as the foxglove tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in late spring. It is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental horticulture. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread aggressively."
