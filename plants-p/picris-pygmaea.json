    "intro": "Picris pygmaea, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-producing heads. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
