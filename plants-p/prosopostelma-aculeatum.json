    "intro": "Prosopostelma aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny flax. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of sharp, spiny structures along the stems and leaves, which provide defense against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
