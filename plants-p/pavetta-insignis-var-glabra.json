    "intro": "Pavetta insignis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
