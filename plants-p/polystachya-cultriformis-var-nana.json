    "intro": "Polystachya cultriformis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sword fern, is a compact, low-growing variant of the sword fern genus. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces clustered, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
