    "intro": "Panicum scandens var. longisetum, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and long, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to purple panicles that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
