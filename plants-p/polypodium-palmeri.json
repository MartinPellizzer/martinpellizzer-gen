    "intro": "Polypodium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The botanical features of Polypodium palmeri make it well adapted to its harsh, dry habitat."
