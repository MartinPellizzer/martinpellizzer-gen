    "intro": "Pseudoeverardia, commonly known as the false evergreen, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plants are typically evergreen trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They often grow in tropical rainforests and are adapted to high humidity and nutrient-poor soils. Pseudoeverardia species are valued for their ecological roles and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
