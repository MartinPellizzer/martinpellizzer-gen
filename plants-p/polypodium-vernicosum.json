    "intro": "Polypodium vernicosum, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock faces, walls, and woodlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's ability to grow on surfaces without soil makes it an important component of forest ecosystems."
