    "intro": "Pinus pyrenaica subsp. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian pine, is a subspecies native to North Africa, particularly Morocco and the western Sahara. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more slender, with scales that open to release the seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. The tree plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems."
