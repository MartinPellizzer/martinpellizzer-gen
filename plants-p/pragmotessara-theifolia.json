    "intro": "Pragmotessara theifolia, commonly known as the thief's leaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that have a unique, almost metallic sheen, which helps it reflect sunlight in dense canopy environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are known to secrete a sticky substance that has been traditionally used in local medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pragmotessara theifolia is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
