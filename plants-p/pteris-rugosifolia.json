    "intro": "Pteris rugosifolia, commonly known as the rough-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are pinnately divided with a rough, serrated texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris rugosifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
