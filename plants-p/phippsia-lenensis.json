    "intro": "Phippsia lenensis, commonly known as the Florida phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinct, pungent scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phippsia lenensis is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
