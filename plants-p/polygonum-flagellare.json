    "intro": "Polygonum flagellare, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and appear in late summer. Polygonum flagellare is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland areas."
