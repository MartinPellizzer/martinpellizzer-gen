    "intro": "Paratropia rigida var. venosa, commonly known as the veined rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves with prominent veins, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with warm, dry conditions."
