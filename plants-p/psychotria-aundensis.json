It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Psychotria aundensis is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
