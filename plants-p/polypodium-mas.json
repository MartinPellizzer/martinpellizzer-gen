    "intro": "Polypodium mas, commonly known as the serrate polypody, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in woodlands. Its rhizomes are perennial and produce new fronds throughout the growing season. The serrate polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
