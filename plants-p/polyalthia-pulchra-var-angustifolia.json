    "intro": "Polyalthia pulchra var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is less commonly used than other members of the Polyalthia genus. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and graceful growth habit."
