    "intro": "Polygonatum polyanthemum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features elongated, arching stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and forest understories."
