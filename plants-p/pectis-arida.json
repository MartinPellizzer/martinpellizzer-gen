    "intro": "Pectis arida, commonly known as the desert pectis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Pectis arida is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
