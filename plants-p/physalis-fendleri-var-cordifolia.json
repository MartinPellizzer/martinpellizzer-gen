    "intro": "Physalis fendleri var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of orange-red, lantern-like fruits that encase the true berries. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and the fruit develops from a single ovary, typical of the Solanaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
