    "intro": "Paspalum abstrusum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
