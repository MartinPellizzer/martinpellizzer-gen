    "intro": "Poa smirnowii subsp. polozhiae, commonly known as the Smirnov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a clumping growth habit, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
