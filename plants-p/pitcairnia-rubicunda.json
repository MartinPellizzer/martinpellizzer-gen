    "intro": "Pitcairnia rubicunda, commonly known as the red pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often form a rosette shape, which helps collect rainwater. Pitcairnia rubicunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
