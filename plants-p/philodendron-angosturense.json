    "intro": "Philodendron angosturense, commonly known as the Angostura philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
