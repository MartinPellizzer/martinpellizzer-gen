    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa f. cordiconeifolia, commonly known as the silky poplar or white poplar, is a hybrid species within the Populus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a soft, silky appearance. The plant is native to eastern Asia and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
