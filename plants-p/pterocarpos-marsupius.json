    "intro": "Pterocarpos marsupius, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
