    "intro": "Polypodium garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin, and they remain evergreen throughout the year. Polypodium garrettii thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories."
