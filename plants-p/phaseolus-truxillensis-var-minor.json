    "intro": "Phaseolus truxillensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf common bean, is a lesser-known variety of the common bean genus. It is a climbing legume native to South America, particularly found in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are typically used in local cuisines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often grown in home gardens for its nutritional value. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and agricultural researchers."
