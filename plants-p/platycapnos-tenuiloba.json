    "intro": "Platycapnos tenuiloba, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
