    "intro": "Pimpinella nabelekii, commonly known as the Nabelek's cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
