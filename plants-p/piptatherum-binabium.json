    "intro": "Piptatherum binabium, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Piptatherum binabium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
