    "intro": "Polygonum donianum, commonly known as the Donian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough, serrated margin, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
