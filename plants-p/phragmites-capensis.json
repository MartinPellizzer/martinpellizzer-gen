    "intro": "Phragmites capensis, commonly known as the Cape reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, lake shores, and riverbanks, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
