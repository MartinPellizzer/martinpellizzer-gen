    "intro": "Pellaea limitanea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through sexual means. Pellaea limitanea has a compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
