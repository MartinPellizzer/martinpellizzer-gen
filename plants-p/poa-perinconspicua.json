    "intro": "Poa perinconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous bentgrass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikelets, and it reproduces through wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
