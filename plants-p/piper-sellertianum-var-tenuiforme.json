    "intro": "Piper sellertianum var. tenuiforme, commonly known as the slender-leaf pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves with a distinctively veined structure. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The varietal form, tenuiforme, is distinguished by its narrower leaf shape compared to other varieties of Piper sellertianum."
