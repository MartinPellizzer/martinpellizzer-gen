    "intro": "Philodendron englerianum subsp. duidae, commonly known as the Duidae philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
