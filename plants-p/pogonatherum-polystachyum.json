    "intro": "Pogonatherum polystachyum, commonly known as the hairy grass or Indian grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces inflorescences that are often described as panicles, which are branched clusters of small flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its adaptability and ornamental potential."
