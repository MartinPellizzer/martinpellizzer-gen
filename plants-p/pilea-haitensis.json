    "intro": "Pilea haitensis, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It features round, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea haitensis is popular as a houseplant due to its easy care requirements and attractive foliage."
