It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or rounded in shape, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are followed by unique, spherical seed capsules. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for container gardening and as a decorative plant."
