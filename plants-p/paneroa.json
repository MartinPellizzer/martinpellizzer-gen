    "intro": "Paneroa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth texture. Paneroa flowers are small and typically greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
