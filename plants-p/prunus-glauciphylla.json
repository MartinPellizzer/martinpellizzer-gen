    "intro": "Prunus glauciphylla, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Prunus glauciphylla is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
