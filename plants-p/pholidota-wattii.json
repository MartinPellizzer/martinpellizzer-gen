    "intro": "Pholidota wattii, commonly known as the Watt's flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and spreading crown. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The tree is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
