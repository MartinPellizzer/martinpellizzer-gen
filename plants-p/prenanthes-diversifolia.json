    "intro": "Prenanthes diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, often lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. Prenanthes diversifolia is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
