    "intro": "Polylepis tenuiruga, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, silver-green leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various endemic species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
