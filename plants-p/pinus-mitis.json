    "intro": "Pinus mitis, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically arranged in a flat spruce-like pattern. The tree produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against forest fires. The Douglas fir is valued for its strong, durable wood and is an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
