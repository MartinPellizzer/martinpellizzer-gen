    "intro": "Persea lingue var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp avocado, is a variant of the Persea lingue species native to wetland habitats in southern Florida. It is a small evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits resembling avocados but smaller in size. Its fruit has a thin, smooth skin and a creamy, oily pulp that is used in local culinary traditions. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas."
