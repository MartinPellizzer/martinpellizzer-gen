    "intro": "Potamogeton rufescens subsp. nigrescens, commonly known as black-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf coloration and stem characteristics compared to other varieties of Potamogeton rufescens."
