    "intro": "Penstemon spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon spinulosus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
