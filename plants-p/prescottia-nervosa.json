    "intro": "Prescottia nervosa, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high elevations of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Prescottia nervosa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
