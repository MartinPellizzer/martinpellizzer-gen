    "intro": "Potentilla glandulifera var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in small glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
