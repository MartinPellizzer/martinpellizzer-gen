    "intro": "Packera dimorphophylla var. paysonii, commonly known as Payson's pearly everlet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive pearly or waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Packera dimorphophylla."
