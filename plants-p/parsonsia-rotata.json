    "intro": "Parsonsia rotata, commonly known as the night-flowering moonflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces bright orange or red berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals."
