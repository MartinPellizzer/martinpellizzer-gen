It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28, providing structural support and aiding in photosynthesis. This orchid is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it benefits from the moist, shaded conditions of the rainforest canopy."
