    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. elongatum, commonly known as tall meadow fescue, is a variant of the common meadow fescue species. It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
