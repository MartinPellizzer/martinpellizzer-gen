    "intro": "Pholidia polyclada, commonly known as the clustered starfruit or clustered physalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered calyces that enclose the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
