    "intro": "Prunus pabotii, commonly known as the Chinese plum or Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, sour-tasting fruits. Prunus pabotii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
