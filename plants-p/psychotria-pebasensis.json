    "intro": "Psychotria pebasensis, commonly known as the Pebas psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, lowland tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its striking, dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange when mature. Psychotria pebasensis is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
