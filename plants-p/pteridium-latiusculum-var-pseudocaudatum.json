    "intro": "Pteridium latiusculum var. pseudocaudatum, commonly known as the false horse-tail fern, is a variant of the common bracken fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is characterized by its slightly shorter and more narrow fronds compared to the typical variety of Pteridium latiusculum."
