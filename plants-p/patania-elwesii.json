It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a compact rosette of leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Patania elwesii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
