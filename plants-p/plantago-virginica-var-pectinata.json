It features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to spread through rhizomes."
