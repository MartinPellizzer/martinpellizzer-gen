    "intro": "Prunus humilis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
