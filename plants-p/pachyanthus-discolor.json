    "intro": "Pachyanthus discolor, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has waxy, broad leaves that are typically green with a slight white or silver sheen. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it is also known to host the pink hibiscus mealybug, a pest that can cause significant damage to other plants."
