    "intro": "Persepolium aridum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a resilient plant adapted to arid environments. It features a compact growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reduces water loss through transpiration. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Persepolium aridum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
