    "intro": "Placopoda virgata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, depending on the region. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the stems are short and often lie close to the ground. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
