    "intro": "Pedilonum reinwardtii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a unique combination of color and form that makes it highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum reinwardtii is considered endangered in its natural range."
