It features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.
