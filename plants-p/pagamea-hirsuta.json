It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pagamea hirsuta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
