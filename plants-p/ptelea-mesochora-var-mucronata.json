    "intro": "Ptelea mesochora var. mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and native landscaping in its natural range."
