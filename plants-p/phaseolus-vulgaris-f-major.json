The plant is typically found in warm climates and thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and flowers that are usually white or pale pink. The giant common bean is valued for its high yield and is often cultivated for both culinary and agricultural purposes."
