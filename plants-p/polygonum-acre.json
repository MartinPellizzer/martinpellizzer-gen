    "intro": "Polygonum acre, commonly known as prostrate knotweed, is a sprawling perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats with slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant has small, arrow-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Polygonum acre is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
