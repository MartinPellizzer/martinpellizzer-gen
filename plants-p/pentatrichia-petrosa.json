    "intro": "Pentatrichia petrosa, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Pentatrichia petrosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid habitats."
