    "intro": "Phyteuma charmelii f. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf false bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, rounded, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense, low-growing clumps, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
