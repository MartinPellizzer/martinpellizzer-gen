    "intro": "Phyllodoce myrtifolia, commonly known as the alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, especially in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Phyllodoce myrtifolia is well adapted to cold, moist conditions and is often found in tundra and subalpine regions."
