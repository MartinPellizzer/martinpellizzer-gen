    "intro": "Polybotrya aristeguietae, commonly known as the Chilean fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the temperate regions of Chile. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
