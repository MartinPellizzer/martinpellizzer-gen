    "intro": "Pedicularis chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
