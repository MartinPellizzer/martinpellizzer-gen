It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood."
