    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina, commonly known as the Persian peony, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves and has a deep root system adapted to its arid environment. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
