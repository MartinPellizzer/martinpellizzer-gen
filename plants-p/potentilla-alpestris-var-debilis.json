    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. debilis, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and pinnately divided leaves with numerous small leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine plantings."
