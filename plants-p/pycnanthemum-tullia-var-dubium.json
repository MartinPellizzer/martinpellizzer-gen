It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and meadows. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The varietal form 'dubium' is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different flower coloration compared to the typical form."
