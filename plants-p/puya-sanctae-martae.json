    "intro": "Puya sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it collect and store water in its native high-altitude environment. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
