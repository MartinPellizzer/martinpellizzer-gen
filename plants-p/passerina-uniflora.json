    "intro": "Passerina uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Passerina uniflora is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in its native environment."
