    "intro": "Pubilaria bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored pubilaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a white base with a deep purple or violet upper lip. The plant belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is known for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
