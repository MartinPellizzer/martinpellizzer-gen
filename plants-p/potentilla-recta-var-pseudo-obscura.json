    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. pseudo-obscura, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features upright, slender stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
