    "intro": "Psilocaulon pomeridianum, commonly known as the evening orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, nocturnal blooms that open in the evening. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
