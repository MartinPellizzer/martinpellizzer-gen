    "intro": "Potentilla pontica, commonly known as the Pontic cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Potentilla pontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
