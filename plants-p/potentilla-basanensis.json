    "intro": "Potentilla basanensis, commonly known as the Basan mountain cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
