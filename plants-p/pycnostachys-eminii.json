    "intro": "Pycnostachys eminii, commonly known as the Ethiopian violet, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a glossy surface, while its growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and noteworthy species in botanical collections."
