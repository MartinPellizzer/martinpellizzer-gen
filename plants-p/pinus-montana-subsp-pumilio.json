    "intro": "Pinus montana subsp. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a subspecies native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and other mountainous regions in Europe. It is a small, slow-growing conifer that typically reaches heights of less than 5 meters. The tree has a compact, often shrub-like form with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
