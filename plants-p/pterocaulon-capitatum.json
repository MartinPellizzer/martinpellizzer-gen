    "intro": "Pterocaulon capitatum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pterocaulon capitatum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
