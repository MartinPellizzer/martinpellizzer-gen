    "intro": "Polygala heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, often clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are variable in shape, which is reflected in its common name, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Polygala heterophylla is often found in open grasslands and is a component of the local flora in its native range."
