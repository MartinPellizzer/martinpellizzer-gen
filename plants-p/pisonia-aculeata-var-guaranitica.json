    "intro": "Pisonia aculeata var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Brazilian coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences of bright red or orange flowers, which are often mistaken for coral due to their appearance. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and moist forest habitats, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
