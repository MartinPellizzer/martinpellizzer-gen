    "intro": "Peruvocereus \u00d7 albisetatus, commonly known as the white-flowered night bloomer, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of large, white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
