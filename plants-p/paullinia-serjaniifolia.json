    "intro": "Paullinia serjaniifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop or Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fruits resembling a star shape, hence its common name. The fruit has a sweet and aromatic pulp, though it is not related to the true starfruit (Carambola). It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit in tropical regions."
