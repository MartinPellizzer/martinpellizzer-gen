    "intro": "Packera buekii, commonly known as the Buek's golden aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Packera buekii is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of subalpine ecosystems."
