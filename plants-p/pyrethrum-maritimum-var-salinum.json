It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in natural pest control."
