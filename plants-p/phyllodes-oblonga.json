    "intro": "Phyllodes oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features long, narrow phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Phyllodes oblonga is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the inland regions of Australia."
