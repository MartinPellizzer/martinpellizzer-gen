    "intro": "Paspalum pontanalis, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Paspalum pontanalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
