    "intro": "Polystichum coniifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feather-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum coniifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant appearance."
