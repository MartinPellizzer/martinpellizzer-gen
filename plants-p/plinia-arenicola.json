    "intro": "Plinia arenicola, commonly known as the sand pine or coastal sandplum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its fruit, a small red berry, is an important food source for various wildlife species. Plinia arenicola is adapted to harsh coastal environments and is resistant to salt spray and wind."
