    "intro": "Pteris atrovirens f. atrovirens, commonly known as the black fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental use."
