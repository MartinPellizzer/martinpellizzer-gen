It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
