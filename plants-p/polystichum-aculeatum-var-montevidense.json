    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense sword fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to South America. It features dark green, leathery, and lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
