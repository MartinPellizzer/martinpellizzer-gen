    "intro": "Physalis linkiana var. venosa, commonly known as the hairy physalis, is a variant of the common physalis species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, inflated calyx that encloses the berry-like fruit, which turns orange-red when mature. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit is edible, often used in culinary applications, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
