It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
