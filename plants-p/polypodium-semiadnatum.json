    "intro": "Polypodium semiadnatum, commonly known as the semi-adnate polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered in rosettes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern. Polypodium semiadnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
