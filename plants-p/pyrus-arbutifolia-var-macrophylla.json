    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical Pyrus arbutifolia, often reaching up to 5 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color in summer. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
