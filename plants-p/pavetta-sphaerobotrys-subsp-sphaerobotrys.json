    "intro": "Pavetta sphaerobotrys subsp. sphaerobotrys, commonly known as the spherical pavetta, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal flowering."
