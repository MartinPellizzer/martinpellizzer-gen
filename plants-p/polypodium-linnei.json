    "intro": "Polypodium linnei, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Polypodium linnei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
