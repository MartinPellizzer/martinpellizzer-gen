    "intro": "Peyrousia marmorata, commonly known as the marble cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Peyrousia marmorata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive prolonged droughts. Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
