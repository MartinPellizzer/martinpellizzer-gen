    "intro": "Pteris longula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Pteris longula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
