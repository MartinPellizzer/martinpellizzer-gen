    "intro": "Passerina tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a four-angled stem, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
