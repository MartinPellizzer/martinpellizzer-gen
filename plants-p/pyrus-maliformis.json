It is native to southern China and is characterized by its distinctive, often irregularly shaped fruits. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, while its flowers are white and clustered in cymes. The fruit, which is usually pear-shaped but can be deformed, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
