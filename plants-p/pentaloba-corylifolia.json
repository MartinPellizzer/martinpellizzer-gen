    "intro": "Pentaloba corylifolia, commonly known as the Chinese hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
