    "intro": "Panicum hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
