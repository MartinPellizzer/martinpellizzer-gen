It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale green flowers. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its intricate ecological dependencies. Its habitat is highly restricted, making it vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this enigmatic and endangered species."
