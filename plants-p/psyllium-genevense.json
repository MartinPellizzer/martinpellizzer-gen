    "intro": "Psyllium genevense, commonly known as the common psyllium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a mucilaginous substance when its seeds are soaked in water, which is widely used in dietary supplements and as a natural binder in pharmaceuticals. Its fibrous husk is also valued for its high content of soluble fiber. Psyllium genevense is cultivated for both its nutritional properties and its ability to improve soil structure in agricultural settings."
