    "intro": "Phyllostachys nigra f. basinigra, commonly known as the black bamboo or black-striped bamboo, is a variant of the black bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black culms that are often streaked with lighter green or yellow, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant is a clump-forming grass that grows in dense stands, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy dark green color. This ornamental bamboo is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique appearance."
