    "intro": "Picea brachytyla var. ascendens, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal environments with high humidity and frequent rainfall. It plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the local biodiversity. This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Picea brachytyla."
