    "intro": "Polypodium californicum f. parsonsiae, commonly known as the Parsons' shield fern, is a rare fern species native to California. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a dense, velvety underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
