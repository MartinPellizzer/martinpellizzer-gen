    "intro": "Potentilla oscensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Potentilla oscensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
