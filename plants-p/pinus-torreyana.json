    "intro": "Pinus torreyana, commonly known as Torrey pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cones that range from 2 to 4 inches in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered one of the rarest pine species in the world."
