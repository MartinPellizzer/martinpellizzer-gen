    "intro": "Pteris giasii, commonly known as the Giasii water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Pteris giasii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
