It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
