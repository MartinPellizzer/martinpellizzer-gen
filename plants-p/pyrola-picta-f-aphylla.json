    "intro": "Pyrola picta f. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless pink wintergreen, is a rare and striking variant of the Pyrola picta species. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present instead. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
