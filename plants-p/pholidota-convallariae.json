    "intro": "Pholidota convallariae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its specialized structure allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often in the canopies of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
