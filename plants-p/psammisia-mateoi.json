    "intro": "Psammisia mateoi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Psammisia mateoi plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
