It is a perennial herb characterized by its tuberous rhizomes and erect, herbaceous stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers arranged in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a slightly pointed apex, giving it its specific epithet. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
