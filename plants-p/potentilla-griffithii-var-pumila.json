    "intro": "Potentilla griffithii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a compact, rounded shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
