    "intro": "Porophyllum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Porophyllum palmeri is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
