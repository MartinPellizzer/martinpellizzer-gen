    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. alsinoides, commonly known as the Alsike clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural settings. However, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits."
