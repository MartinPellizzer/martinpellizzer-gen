    "intro": "Pomaderris adnata, commonly known as the silky pomaderris, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-grey foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the autumn season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft, fluffy look. Pomaderris adnata is typically found in coastal and heathland environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
