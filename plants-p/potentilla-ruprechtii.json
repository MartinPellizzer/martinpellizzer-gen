    "intro": "Potentilla ruprechtii, commonly known as alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to its bright floral display. Potentilla ruprechtii is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
