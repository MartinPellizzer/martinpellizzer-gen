It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, showy yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and inland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and insects."
