    "intro": "Pyrethrum grossheimii, commonly known as the grandiflorum pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrin, a compound used in organic pesticides. Pyrethrum grossheimii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
