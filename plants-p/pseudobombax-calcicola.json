    "intro": "Pseudobombax calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ceiba, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 20\u201330 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pseudobombax calcicola thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
