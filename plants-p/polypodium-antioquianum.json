    "intro": "Polypodium antioquianum, commonly known as the Antioquian shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium antioquianum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
