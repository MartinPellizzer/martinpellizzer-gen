    "intro": "Polylophium involucratum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
