    "intro": "Pleurothallis sempergemmata, commonly known as the ever-gemming pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of South America. This small epiphytic orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in small inflorescences. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and challenging species for cultivation."
