    "intro": "Pinus luchuensis subsp. hwangshanensis, commonly known as the Hwangshan pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Hwangshan Mountains in China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine genus. The tree exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
