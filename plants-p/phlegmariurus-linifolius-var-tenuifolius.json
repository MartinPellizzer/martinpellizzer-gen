    "intro": "Phlegmariurus linifolius var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its branching stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The leaves are often less than 1 cm in length, contributing to its delicate, moss-like appearance. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
