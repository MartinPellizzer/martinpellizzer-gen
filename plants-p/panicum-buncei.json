    "intro": "Panicum buncei, commonly known as the Bunce panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Botanically, it is distinguished by its rhizomatous growth habit and its adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
