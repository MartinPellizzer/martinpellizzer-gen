It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its arid environment. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance to native pollinators."
