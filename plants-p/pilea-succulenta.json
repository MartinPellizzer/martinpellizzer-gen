    "intro": "Pilea succulenta, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to China. It features glossy, round, fleshy leaves that resemble small coins, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. Pilea succulenta thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
