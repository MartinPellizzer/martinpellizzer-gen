    "intro": "Polypodium wui, commonly known as the Wui cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that typically grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across substrates. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ability to capture moisture from the air. Polypodium wui is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded habitats."
