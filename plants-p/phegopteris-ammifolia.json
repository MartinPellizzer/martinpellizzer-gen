It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. This plant thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris ammifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study."
