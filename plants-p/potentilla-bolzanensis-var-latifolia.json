    "intro": "Potentilla bolzanensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
