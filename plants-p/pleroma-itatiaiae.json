    "intro": "Pleroma itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
