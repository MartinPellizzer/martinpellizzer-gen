    "intro": "Pelexia sheviakii, commonly known as the Shishkin's pelexia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
