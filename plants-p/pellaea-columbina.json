    "intro": "Pellaea columbina, commonly known as the Columbian rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Pellaea columbina is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, rock outcrops, and open woodlands."
