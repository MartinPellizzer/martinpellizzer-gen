    "intro": "Polium montanum, commonly known as mountain polium, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Polium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
