    "intro": "Palmijuncus horrens, commonly known as the dwarf fan palm, is a small, compact palm native to the island of Socotra. It features a short trunk covered in fibrous, leaf-like structures that resemble a fan. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern around the base. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
