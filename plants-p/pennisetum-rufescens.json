It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and striking purple-tinted foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces feathery, pinkish-white inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Pennisetum rufescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its drought tolerance."
