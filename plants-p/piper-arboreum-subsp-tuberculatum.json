    "intro": "Piper arboreum subsp. tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with slightly hairy undersides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
