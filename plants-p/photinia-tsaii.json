It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Photinia tsaii is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its relatively disease-resistant nature."
