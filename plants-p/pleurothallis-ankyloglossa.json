    "intro": "Pleurothallis ankyloglossa, commonly known as the Ankyloglossa orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found clinging to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's intricate floral structure is a key feature in its pollination strategy, attracting specific insect pollinators."
