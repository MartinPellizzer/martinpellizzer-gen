    "intro": "Pseudolepanthes silverstonei, commonly known as the silverstone orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often display a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that help conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudolepanthes silverstonei is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
