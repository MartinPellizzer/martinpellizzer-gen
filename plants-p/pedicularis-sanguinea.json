It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking red petals and yellow throat. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
