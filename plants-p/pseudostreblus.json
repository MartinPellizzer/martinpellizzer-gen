    "intro": "Pseudostreblus, commonly known as the false strangler fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are characterized by their rapid growth and ability to form dense canopies, often leading to the death of the host tree. Pseudostreblus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Their leaves are usually large, simple, and opposite, with a rough texture. The fruits are small, fleshy, and often aggregate in clusters, attracting various wildlife species."
