    "intro": "Paspalum kappleri, commonly known as the kappler's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Paspalum kappleri is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
