    "intro": "Panicum indicum var. oryzetorum, commonly known as rice grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, fluffy panicles that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
