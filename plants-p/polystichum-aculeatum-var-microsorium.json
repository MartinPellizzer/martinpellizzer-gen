    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. microsorium, commonly known as the miniature sword fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens. Its small size and elegant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
