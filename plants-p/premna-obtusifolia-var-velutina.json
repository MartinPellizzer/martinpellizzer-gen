    "intro": "Premna obtusifolia var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf premna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soft foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
