It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks.
