    "intro": "Piqueria serrata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf piqueria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its structure includes a low-growing, mat-forming habit with multiple stems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
