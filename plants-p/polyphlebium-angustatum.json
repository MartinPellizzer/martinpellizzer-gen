    "intro": "Polyphlebium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
