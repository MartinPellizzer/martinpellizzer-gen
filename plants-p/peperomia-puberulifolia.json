    "intro": "Peperomia puberulifolia, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is typically dark green with a glossy appearance, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. Peperomia puberulifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive, textured leaves."
