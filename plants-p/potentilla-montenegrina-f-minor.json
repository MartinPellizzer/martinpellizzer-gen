It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing plants."
