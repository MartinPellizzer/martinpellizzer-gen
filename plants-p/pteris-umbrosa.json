    "intro": "Pteris umbrosa, commonly known as the shady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shady gardens."
