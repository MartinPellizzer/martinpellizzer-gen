    "intro": "Populus fangiana var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The bark is smooth and grayish in color, with a distinctive flaky texture."
