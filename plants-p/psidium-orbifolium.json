    "intro": "Psidium orbifolium, commonly known as the orbifoliate guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits with a sweet and tart flavor. Its fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, and it is valued for both its ornamental appeal and culinary uses. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
