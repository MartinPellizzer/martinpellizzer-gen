    "intro": "Phyllostachys viridis var. holochrysa, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the green bamboo species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green culms that contrast with its dark green leaves. This bamboo is a clumping type, growing in dense clusters rather than spreading aggressively. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its unique coloration and manageable growth habit make it a popular choice for landscaping and bamboo enthusiasts."
