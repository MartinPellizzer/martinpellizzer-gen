    "intro": "Polystichum stimulans, commonly known as the stimulant fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle. Polystichum stimulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, architectural form."
