    "intro": "Pedicularis jucunda, commonly known as the lesser monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face, hence its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies."
