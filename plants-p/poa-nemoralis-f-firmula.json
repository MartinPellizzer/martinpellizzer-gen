    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. firmula, commonly known as the firm-leaf wood sedge, is a variant of the wood sedge species native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow, stiff, and dark green, with a prominent midrib. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This form is distinguished by its more rigid leaf structure compared to the typical form of Poa nemoralis."
