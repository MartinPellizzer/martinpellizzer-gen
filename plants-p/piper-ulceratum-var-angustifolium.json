    "intro": "Piper ulceratum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pepper plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm wide. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
