    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellowish-green in color. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive balsam-like scent when scraped. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along rivers and in wetlands."
