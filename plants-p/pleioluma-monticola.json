    "intro": "Pleioluma monticola, commonly known as the mountain pleioluma, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleioluma monticola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
