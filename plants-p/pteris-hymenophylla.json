    "intro": "Pteris hymenophylla, commonly known as the silver fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. Pteris hymenophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings."
