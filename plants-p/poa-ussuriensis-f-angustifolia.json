    "intro": "Poa ussuriensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in alpine and subarctic regions, where it contributes to the vegetation structure and soil stability. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitat."
