    "intro": "Polypodiodes transpianensis, commonly known as the Transpianensis fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
