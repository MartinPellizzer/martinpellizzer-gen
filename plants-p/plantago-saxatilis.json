    "intro": "Plantago saxatilis, commonly known as rock plantain, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender stalks. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
