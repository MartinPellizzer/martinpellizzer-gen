    "intro": "Polygonum alatum var. adenothrix, commonly known as the velvetleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
