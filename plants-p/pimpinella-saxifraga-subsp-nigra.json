    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga subsp. nigra, commonly known as black rock-parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or rocky habitats. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and ecological characteristics compared to other Pimpinella species."
