    "intro": "Panicum poiforme, commonly known as the prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like blades that often form dense mats on the ground, with a distinctive, rounded or oval shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear feathery, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its adaptability and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in warm climates."
