It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure. Its resilience and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
