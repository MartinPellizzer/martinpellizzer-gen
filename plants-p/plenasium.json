    "intro": "Plenasium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Plenasium is typically found in wetlands and along riverbanks in tropical and subtropical regions."
