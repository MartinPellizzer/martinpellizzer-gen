    "intro": "Philodendron applanatum, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen philodendron, is a climbing plant native to Mexico and Central America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth, waxy texture and a striking, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
