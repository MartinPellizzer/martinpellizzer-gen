    "intro": "Pitcairnia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The flowers, which are often pink or red, are borne on a central stem and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
