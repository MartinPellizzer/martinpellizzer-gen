    "intro": "Polypodium suboligolepidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in forested areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
