    "intro": "Poa pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are usually blue or purple, and it blooms during the cooler months. Poa pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
