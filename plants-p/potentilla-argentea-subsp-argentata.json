    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. argentata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
