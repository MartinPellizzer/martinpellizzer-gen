    "intro": "Piper nudispicuum, commonly known as the smooth-spined pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that contains the seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
