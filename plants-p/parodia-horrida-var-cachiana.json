    "intro": "Parodia horrida var. cachiana, commonly known as the Cachiana Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny areoles that bear short, white bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters near the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
