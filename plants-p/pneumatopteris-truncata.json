    "intro": "Pneumatopteris truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Pneumatopteris truncata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
