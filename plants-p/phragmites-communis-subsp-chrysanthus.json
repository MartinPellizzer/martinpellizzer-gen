    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. chrysanthus, commonly known as the yellow bullrush, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, yellowish seed heads that are distinctive in appearance. It is often found in coastal areas, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its extensive rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly and establish itself in a variety of aquatic habitats."
