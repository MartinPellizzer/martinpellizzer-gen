    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. virens, commonly known as the green dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few meters in height, and its dense, compact growth habit. Its needles are a distinctive bright green color, contrasting with the more common gray-green of the typical whitebark pine. The cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
