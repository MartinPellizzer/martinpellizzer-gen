    "intro": "Plectranthus altanmouiensis, commonly known as the Altanmouensis mint, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, tubular flowers that are often violet or blue in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a fragrant, mint-like aroma, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils. This species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties."
