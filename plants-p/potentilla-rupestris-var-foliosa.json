    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. foliosa, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and arid regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
