    "intro": "Pterocactus marenae, commonly known as the Marenae pterocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are adapted to absorb and store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
