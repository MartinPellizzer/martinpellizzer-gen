    "intro": "Plowmanianthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panama plowman's plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
