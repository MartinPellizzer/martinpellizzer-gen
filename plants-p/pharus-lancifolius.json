    "intro": "Pharus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pharus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
