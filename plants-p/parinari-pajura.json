    "intro": "Parinari pajura, commonly known as the red-fruit parinari, is a small to medium-sized tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red, fleshy drupes that are edible. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a faintly aromatic scent, and it is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Parinari pajura is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
