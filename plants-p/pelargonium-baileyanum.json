    "intro": "Pelargonium baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileyanum geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with opposite, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
