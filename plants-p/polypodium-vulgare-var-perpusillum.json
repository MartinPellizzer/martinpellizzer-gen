    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. perpusillum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and compact fern species native to the forests of Europe. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a graceful, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
