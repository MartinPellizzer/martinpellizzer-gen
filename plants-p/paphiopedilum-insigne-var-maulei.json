    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. maulei, commonly known as the Maule's velvet lip, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pleated, and velvety leaves, which are typically dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a small pouch, a feature common in many orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its exotic appearance."
