    "intro": "Pilosella pilosellina subsp. pseudoradians, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
