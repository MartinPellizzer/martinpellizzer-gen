These plants are typically low-growing, mat-forming shrubs that thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They have fleshy, often succulent leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or white. Portulacastrum species are adapted to hot, dry conditions and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. They are used in some regions for ornamental purposes or as part of local traditional medicine."
