    "intro": "Papaver lujaurense, commonly known as the Luj\u00e1uren poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep crimson. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
