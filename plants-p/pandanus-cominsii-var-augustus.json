    "intro": "Pandanus cominsii var. augustus, commonly known as the New Guinea pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, edible fruits. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring well-drained sandy soils. Its versatility and resilience make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
