    "intro": "Pleiotaxis huillensis var. macrocephala, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n giant pleiotaxis, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, which can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant has a robust, branching stem and feathery, finely divided leaves that are often aromatic. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
