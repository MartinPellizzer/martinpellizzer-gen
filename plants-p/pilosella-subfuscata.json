    "intro": "Pilosella subfuscata, commonly known as the brown hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has slender, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Pilosella subfuscata is often found in low vegetation layers and is relatively easy to identify due to its distinctive, softly hairy appearance."
