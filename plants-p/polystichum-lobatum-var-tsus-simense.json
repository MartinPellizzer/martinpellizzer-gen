    "intro": "Polystichum lobatum var. tsus-simense, commonly known as the Tsus-simense wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
