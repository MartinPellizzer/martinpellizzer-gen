    "intro": "Paspalum acutissimum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense mats. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Paspalum acutissimum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
