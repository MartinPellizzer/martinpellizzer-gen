    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. rubra, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the European pine native to northern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, distinguishing it from other pine species. The tree produces cones that range in size and shape, with the female cones being particularly notable for their elongated form. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting a wide range of wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
