    "intro": "Polystichum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds producing spore-bearing structures called sori. Its leaves are divided into segments with a serrated margin, and it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Polystichum wrightii is often found in rich, well-drained soils and is a common sight in eastern North American forests."
