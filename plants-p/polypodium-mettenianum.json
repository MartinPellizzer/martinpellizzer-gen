    "intro": "Polypodium mettenianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments that help increase surface area for photosynthesis. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
