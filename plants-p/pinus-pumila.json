    "intro": "Pinus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff needles and small, cone-like fruits. This species thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often growing at high altitudes where other plants struggle to survive. Its dense foliage provides excellent ground cover and helps prevent soil erosion. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions."
