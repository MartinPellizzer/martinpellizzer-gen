    "intro": "Pyrrocoma cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's pygmy mallow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
