    "intro": "Phoradendron avenium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are evergreen, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers. Phoradendron avenium plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
