    "intro": "Poa fulva, commonly known as yellow meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. The plant has slender, leafy stems with a distinctive yellowish hue, especially in the inflorescence. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, which are small clusters of bracteate flowers. Poa fulva is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
