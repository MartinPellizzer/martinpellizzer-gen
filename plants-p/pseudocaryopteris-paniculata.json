    "intro": "Pseudocaryopteris paniculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mountain cedar, is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly appressed to the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
