    "intro": "Polystichum himalayense, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
