    "intro": "Pithecellobium saman var. acutifolium, commonly known as the velvet tamarind or saman tree, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a dense, umbrella-shaped canopy with bipinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in reforestation efforts. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
