    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 wiemannioides, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, dark green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it forms dense mats or small bushes. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
