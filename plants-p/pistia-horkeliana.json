    "intro": "Pistia horkeliana, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rosette-like structure with broad, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
