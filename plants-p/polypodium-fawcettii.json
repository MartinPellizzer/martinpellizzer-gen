    "intro": "Polypodium fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's cliff fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
