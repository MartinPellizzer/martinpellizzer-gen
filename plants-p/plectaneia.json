    "intro": "Plectaneia, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish or white flowers. They are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance. Plectaneia species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments."
