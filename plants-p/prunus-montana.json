    "intro": "Prunus montana, commonly known as the mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young. Prunus montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife in its native habitats."
