    "intro": "Pteris sterilis, commonly known as the barren water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the fronds, making it less conspicuous than other fern species. Pteris sterilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
