    "intro": "Polypodium oleandroides, commonly known as the Indian cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically leathery and divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forests. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
