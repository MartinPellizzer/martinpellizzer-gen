    "intro": "Philadelphus madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1os honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically hairy underneath. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
