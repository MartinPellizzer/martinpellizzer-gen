    "intro": "Panicum hirtellum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy texture on its stems and leaves. The plant produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or other soft materials. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
