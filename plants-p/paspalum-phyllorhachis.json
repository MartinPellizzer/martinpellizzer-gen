    "intro": "Paspalum phyllorhachis, commonly known as the silver paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray blades that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Paspalum phyllorhachis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
