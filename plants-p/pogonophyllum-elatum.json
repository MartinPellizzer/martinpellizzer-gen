    "intro": "Pogonophyllum elatum, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores and a potential irritant to humans."
