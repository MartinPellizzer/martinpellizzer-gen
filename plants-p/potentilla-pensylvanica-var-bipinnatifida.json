    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the Pennsylvania cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive bipinnatifid shape, meaning the leaflets are deeply divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
