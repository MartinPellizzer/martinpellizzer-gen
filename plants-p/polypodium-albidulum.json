    "intro": "Polypodium albidulum, commonly known as the white shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on the trunks and branches of trees, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium albidulum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
