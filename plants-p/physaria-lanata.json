    "intro": "Physaria lanata, commonly known as the wooly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, bladder-like pods, a feature that aids in wind dispersal. Physaria lanata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
