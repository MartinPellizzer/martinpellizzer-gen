    "intro": "Pseudoselago candida, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Pseudoselago candida is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory with high humidity and filtered sunlight."
