    "intro": "Pinguicula corsica subvar. coerulescens, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along streambanks. Its flowers are usually pale green or blue, with four petals that are often tinged with purple. It is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
