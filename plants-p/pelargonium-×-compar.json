The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the cultivar. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pelargonium \u00d7 compar is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its cascading foliage and continuous blooming throughout the growing season."
