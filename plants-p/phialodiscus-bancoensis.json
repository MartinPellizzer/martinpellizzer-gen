    "intro": "Phialodiscus bancoensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Nympheaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant has a short stem with a spongy, air-filled structure that helps it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and beetles. Phialodiscus bancoensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
