    "intro": "Polychaetia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved polychaetia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polychaetaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
