    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. chantinii, commonly known as the Chantinii lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a unique floral structure with a pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green in color. It blooms in late winter to early spring, producing flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and temperature requirements."
