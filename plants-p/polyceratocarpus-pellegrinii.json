    "intro": "Polyceratocarpus pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrini's horned cucumber, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a horned cucumber, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and melons. It has palmate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
