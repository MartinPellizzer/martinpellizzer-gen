    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius var. americanus, commonly known as American ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the forests of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries. The plant is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in shady, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in some regions and is protected in several states."
