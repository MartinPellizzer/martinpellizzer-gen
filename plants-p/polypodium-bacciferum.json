    "intro": "Polypodium bacciferum, commonly known as the Indian brake, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a distinctive feature of ferns."
