    "intro": "Przewalskia shebbearei, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and thrives in cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
