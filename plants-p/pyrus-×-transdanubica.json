    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 transdanubica, commonly known as the Transdanubian pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (common spindle-tree). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and borne in clusters. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear-shaped berry that ripens in late summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
