    "intro": "Paphiopedilum, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are native to Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, and are characterized by their unique, slipper-shaped pouch on the lip of their flowers. Paphiopedilum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they often thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, yellow, and purple, and they are prized for their beauty and fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are now considered endangered."
