    "intro": "Pleurocarpus, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It consists of about 10 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are typically small, with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and purple. They have a complex reproductive system involving mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption. The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations to humid, shaded environments."
