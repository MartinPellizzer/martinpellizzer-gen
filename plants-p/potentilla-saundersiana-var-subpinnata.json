It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
