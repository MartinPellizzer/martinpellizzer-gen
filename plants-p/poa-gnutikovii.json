    "intro": "Poa gnutikovii, commonly known as the Gnutikov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Russia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
