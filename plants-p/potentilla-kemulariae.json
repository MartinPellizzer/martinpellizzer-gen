    "intro": "Potentilla kemulariae, commonly known as the Kemulai cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate to cool climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody stems that can become shrub-like over time. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
