    "intro": "Pterophylla lowryana, commonly known as the Lowry's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often bluish-white petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its unique floral structure includes a central umbel of small, clustered flowers surrounded by elongated, leaf-like bracts. Pterophylla lowryana is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
