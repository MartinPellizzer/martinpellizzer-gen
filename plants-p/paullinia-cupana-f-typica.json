It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright red berries containing hard, stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are the primary source of caffeine and other alkaloids, making guarana a popular ingredient in energy drinks and supplements. Its botanical features contribute to its adaptability in tropical environments and its use in traditional medicine."
