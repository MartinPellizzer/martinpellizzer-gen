It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Pilosella wolgensis is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed areas."
