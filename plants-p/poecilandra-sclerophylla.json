    "intro": "Poecilandra sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
