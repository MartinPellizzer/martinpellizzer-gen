    "intro": "Psidium tenuirame, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they are less commonly cultivated than other guava species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and potential ornamental use."
