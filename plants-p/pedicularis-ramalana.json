    "intro": "Pedicularis ramalana, commonly known as the Ramalan flame violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling those of the common violets. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
