    "intro": "Paspalum quadrifarium, commonly known as four-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with four awns on each lemma, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and coastal areas. Paspalum quadrifarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
