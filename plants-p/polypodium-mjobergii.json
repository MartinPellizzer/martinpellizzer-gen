    "intro": "Polypodium mjobergii, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a short, upright rhizome with numerous fronds that are usually dimorphic, consisting of sterile and fertile leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are often curled or rolled. Polypodium mjobergii is native to southern Africa and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its habitat."
