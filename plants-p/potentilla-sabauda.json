    "intro": "Potentilla sabauda, commonly known as the Alpine rose or Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Potentilla sabauda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
