    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. parvispicula, commonly known as the small-spiked panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, reddish-brown spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in wet environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
