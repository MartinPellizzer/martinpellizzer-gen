    "intro": "Psychotria ancaranensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of western Ecuador and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
