    "intro": "Phagnalon woodii, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in sandy soils while accessing moisture deep underground. Phagnalon woodii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is considered a symbol of resilience in desert ecosystems."
