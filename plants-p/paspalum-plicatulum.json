It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Paspalum plicatulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
