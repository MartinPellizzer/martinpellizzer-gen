    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. raglanii, commonly known as the purple snow pea, is a variant of the pea plant characterized by its striking violet-colored pods and seeds. It is a climbing legume that produces tendrils for support, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the pods mature to a mature purple hue. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and edible pods, which can be harvested when young and tender."
