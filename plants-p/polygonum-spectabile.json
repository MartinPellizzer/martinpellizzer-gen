    "intro": "Polygonum spectabile, commonly known as New Zealand gloryflower, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features showy, bright red to orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers in clusters at the base of the bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Polygonum spectabile is valued in gardens for its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators."
