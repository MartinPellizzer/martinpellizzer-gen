    "intro": "Physalis wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's huskfruit, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces distinctive inflated calyces that enclose its berries. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its trailing or ascending stems. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and the fruit is a small, orange-red berry that turns red when mature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
