    "intro": "Pachygone valida, commonly known as the thick-stemmed orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachygone valida is considered a vulnerable species."
