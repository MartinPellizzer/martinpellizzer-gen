    "intro": "Prunus nipponica f. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum with pubescent foliage, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves that give it a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for landscape design in temperate climates."
