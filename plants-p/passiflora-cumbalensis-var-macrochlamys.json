    "intro": "Passiflora cumbalensis var. macrochlamys, commonly known as the Cumbal passionflower, is a striking member of the Passifloraceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns of violet, yellow, and white, which are adapted to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with palmately lobed leaves and produces edible, mildly tart berries. Its botanical features include a complex corona structure and a unique reproductive system that enhances its ecological role in its native habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation."
