    "intro": "Pogogyne douglasii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pogogyne, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like arrangements, and its leaves are finely divided with a fern-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
