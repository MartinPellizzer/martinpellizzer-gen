    "intro": "Pleurothallis altimonile, commonly known as the \"snowy pleurothallis,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in the ground. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
