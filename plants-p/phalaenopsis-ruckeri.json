    "intro": "Phalaenopsis ruckeri, commonly known as the Rucker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. Its leaves are broad and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the air. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive."
