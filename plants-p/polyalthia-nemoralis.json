    "intro": "Polyalthia nemoralis, commonly known as the hill teak or hill mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
