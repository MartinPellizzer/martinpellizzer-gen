    "intro": "Premna latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf premna, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Premna latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
