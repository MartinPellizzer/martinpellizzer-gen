    "intro": "Potentilla williamsii, commonly known as Williams' cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
