    "intro": "Pleurostima brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf pleurostima, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
