    "intro": "Phelipanche ramosa, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems, which help it to retain moisture in arid environments. Its roots are parasitic, allowing it to extract nutrients from host plants, which makes it a problematic weed in agricultural settings. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Africa, and western Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny locations."
