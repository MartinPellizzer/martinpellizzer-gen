    "intro": "Papaver alpinum var. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern\u2019s Himalayan poppy, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking, showy flowers with bright red petals and a prominent central stigma, typical of the Papaver genus. The plant has a robust root system and hairy stems that help it survive in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
