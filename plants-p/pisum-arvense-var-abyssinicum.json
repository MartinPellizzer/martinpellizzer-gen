It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in arid regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
