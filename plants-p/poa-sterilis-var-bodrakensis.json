    "intro": "Poa sterilis var. bodrakensis, commonly known as the Bodraken grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range."
