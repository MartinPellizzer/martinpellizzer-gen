    "intro": "Psychotria garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Psychotria garrettii is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
