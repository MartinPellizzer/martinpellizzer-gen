    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's plane tree, is a rare variant of the oriental plane tree. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically larger and more deeply lobed than those of the typical species. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. While it is not as widely cultivated as other plane tree varieties, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance."
