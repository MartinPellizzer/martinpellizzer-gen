    "intro": "Pleurothallis jaculifera, commonly known as the bullet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble bullets, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Pleurothallis jaculifera is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts."
