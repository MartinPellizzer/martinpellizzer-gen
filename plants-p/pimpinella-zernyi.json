    "intro": "Pimpinella zernyi, commonly known as the mountain cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its fruits are dry, multi-seeded pods that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Pimpinella zernyi is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
