    "intro": "Pistacia atlantica subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish pistachio, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, hard, edible fruits that are similar to true pistachios but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in limestone soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
