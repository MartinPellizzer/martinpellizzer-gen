    "intro": "Poa compressa var. muralis, commonly known as the wall bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky or crevice environments, often found growing on walls, cliffs, and among stones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
