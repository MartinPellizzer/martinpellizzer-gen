    "intro": "Pteris mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. Pteris mickelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
