    "intro": "Prosthechea fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating. Prosthechea fragrans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral scent."
