    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris var. rubescens, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in mountainous and tundra habitats."
