    "intro": "Polypodium fieldingianum, commonly known as the Fielding's fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
