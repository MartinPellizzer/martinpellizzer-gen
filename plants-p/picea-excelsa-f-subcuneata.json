    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow cone white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce, characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense foliage. This subspecies is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce, contributing to its distinct appearance. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for an extended period, adding to its ornamental value. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
