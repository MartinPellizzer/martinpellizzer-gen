    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with slightly hairy leaves, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
