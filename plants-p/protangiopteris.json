    "intro": "Protangiopteris, commonly known as the *Dawsonia* fern, is a genus of extinct giant ferns that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. These plants were characterized by their large, compound fronds that could reach several meters in length. They possessed a unique structure with a tall, trunk-like stem supporting a crown of fronds, which suggests they were well-adapted to the dense, swampy environments of their time. Protangiopteris species had a complex vascular system, enabling efficient water and nutrient transport, which contributed to their impressive size. Fossil records indicate that they played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems."
