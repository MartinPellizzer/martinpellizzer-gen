    "intro": "Platyloma adiantoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance reminiscent of other members of the Adiantum genus."
