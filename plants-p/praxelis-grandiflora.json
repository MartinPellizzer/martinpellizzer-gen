    "intro": "Praxelis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered praxelis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Praxelis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
