It is native to the coastal ranges of California and extends into parts of Oregon. This evergreen conifer typically grows in moist, cool climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its needles are short, dark green, and have a slightly resinous scent. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years."
