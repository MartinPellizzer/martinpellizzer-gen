    "intro": "Prunus cerasiana, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet-tart fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricots. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, adding to its visual appeal."
