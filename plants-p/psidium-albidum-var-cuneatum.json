    "intro": "Psidium albidum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the white guava or cuneatum guava, is a variant of the guava plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically white or pale green on the underside. The flowers are small, white, and fragrant, clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, yellow or green berry with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its ornamental value and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other guava varieties. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight."
