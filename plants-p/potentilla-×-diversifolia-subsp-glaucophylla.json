    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 diversifolia subsp. glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
