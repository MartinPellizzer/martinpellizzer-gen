    "intro": "Puya sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Holy Cross puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
