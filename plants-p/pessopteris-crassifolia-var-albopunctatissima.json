    "intro": "Pessopteris crassifolia var. albopunctatissima, commonly known as the white-spotted water fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in white or silver spots, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are typically floating or semi-submerged, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
