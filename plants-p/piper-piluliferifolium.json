    "intro": "Piper piluliferifolium, commonly known as the pill-bearing leaf pepper, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into peppery, berry-like fruits. The fruits are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, containing a spicy, aromatic compound similar to that found in black pepper. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the unique flavor of its fruits."
