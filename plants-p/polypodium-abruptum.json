    "intro": "Polypodium abruptum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that features a narrow, linear shape. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to steep or uneven substrates. Polypodium abruptum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
