    "intro": "Pinguicula hirtiflora var. euboea, commonly known as the Euboean butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its flowers are usually small and yellowish-green, arranged in a raceme. This variety is noted for its adaptability to semi-aquatic conditions and its unique trapping mechanism for nutrient acquisition."
