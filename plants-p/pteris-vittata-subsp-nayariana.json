It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
