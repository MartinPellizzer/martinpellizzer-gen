    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 arctoalaskensis, commonly known as the Alaskan cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often spread horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems. Potentilla \u00d7 arctoalaskensis is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun, and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
