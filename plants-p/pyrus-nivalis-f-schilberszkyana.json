    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis f. schilberszkyana, commonly known as the Schilberszky's snow pear, is a unique horticultural form of the snow pear. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ornamental value, making it a popular choice for small gardens. The leaves are typically larger and more leathery than those of the standard species, adding visual interest. It produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. This variety is particularly valued for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in temperate climates."
