    "intro": "Pandanus apionops, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and robust structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The leaves are also used in local cuisines and for making thatched roofing materials."
