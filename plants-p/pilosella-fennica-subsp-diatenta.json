    "intro": "Pilosella fennica subsp. diatenta, commonly known as the Fennoscandian pilosella, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are hairy and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
