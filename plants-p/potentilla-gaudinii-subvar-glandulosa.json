    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued plant in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
