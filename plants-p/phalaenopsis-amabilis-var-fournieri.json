    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis var. fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, providing a lush, green backdrop to its floral display. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for indoor gardening and floral arrangements."
