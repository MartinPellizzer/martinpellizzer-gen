    "intro": "Platystele pyriformis, commonly known as the pyriform flat-stemmed orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its short, thick rhizomes and a single, short, erect stem. The plant produces a single, ovate leaf and a single, showy, white to pale green flower with a distinctive, hooded structure. Native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, it thrives in cool, humid, and shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
