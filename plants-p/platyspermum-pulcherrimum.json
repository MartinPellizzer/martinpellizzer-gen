    "intro": "Platyspermum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pendulous clusters of golden-yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in tropical regions."
