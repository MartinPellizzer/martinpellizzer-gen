    "intro": "Physaria rosei subsp. perotensis, commonly known as the Perot's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a bluish-green color and a pubescent surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in sandy or rocky soils."
