It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance. However, it is less commonly grown for fruit production compared to other pear varieties."
