    "intro": "Phegopteris elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris elongata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality."
