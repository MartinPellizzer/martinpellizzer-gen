    "intro": "Phytolacca acinosa var. kaempferi, commonly known as the Japanese pokeweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The plant contains toxic compounds, including alkaloids and saponins, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
