    "intro": "Pitcairnia caricifolia, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Bromeliad,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude, arid environment. Pitcairnia caricifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
