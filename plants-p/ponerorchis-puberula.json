    "intro": "Ponerorchis puberula, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a short rhizome with a cluster of fleshy, leaf-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often have a faint fragrance. Ponerorchis puberula is characterized by its hairy texture on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
