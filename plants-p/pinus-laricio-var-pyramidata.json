    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Pyramidal Larch, is a variant of the Laricio Larch native to the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The needles are arranged in spirals along the branches and are often shed in early spring, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its elegant form and seasonal color changes."
