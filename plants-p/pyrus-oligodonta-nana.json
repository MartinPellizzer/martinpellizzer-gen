    "intro": "Pyrus oligodonta nana, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese white pear, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, edible pear that ripens in late summer, though it is less commonly cultivated than other pear varieties. This plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant form and seasonal display of flowers and fruit."
