    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are cup-shaped with five petals and produce a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds. This variant is less common than the typical red poppy and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
