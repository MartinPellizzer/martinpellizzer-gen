    "intro": "Persea floccosa, commonly known as the woolly persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and large, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to reddish fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The fruit has a sweet, nutty flavor and is often used in traditional cuisine. Persea floccosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical regions."
