    "intro": "Polystichum braunii subsp. purshii, commonly known as the Pursh's wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
