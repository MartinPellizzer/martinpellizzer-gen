It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. Piptatherum sphacelatum is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
