    "intro": "Puya nivalis, commonly known as the snow puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, brightly colored flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Puya nivalis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
