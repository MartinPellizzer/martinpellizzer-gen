It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions."
