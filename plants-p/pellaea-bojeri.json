    "intro": "Pellaea bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's bone fern, is a species of polypodiaceae fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Pellaea bojeri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
