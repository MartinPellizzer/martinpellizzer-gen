    "intro": "Poinsettia punicea, commonly known as the flame poinsettia, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often toxic species. Poinsettia punicea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for holiday decorations and indoor gardening."
