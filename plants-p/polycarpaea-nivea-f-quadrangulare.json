    "intro": "Polycarpaea nivea f. quadrangulare, commonly known as the white polycarpaea, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It is a herbaceous perennial with a compact growth habit and features quadrangular stems, which give it its specific epithet \"quadrangulare.\" The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences. This plant is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and the unique structural adaptations that distinguish it from other members of the Rubiaceae family."
