    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. arbuscula, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it an important species in ecological restoration. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils."
