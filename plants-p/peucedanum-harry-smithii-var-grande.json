    "intro": "Peucedanum harry-smithii var. grande, commonly known as the giant Harry-Smith's angelica, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a feathery, fern-like appearance. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
