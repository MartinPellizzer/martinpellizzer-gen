    "intro": "Piper marsupiiferum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are yellow when unripe and red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is often found in humid, lowland areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
