It is characterized by its wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are often surrounded by specialized bracts. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Polygala orobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native pollinators."
