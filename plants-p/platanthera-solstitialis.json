    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis, commonly known as the summer lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soils. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
