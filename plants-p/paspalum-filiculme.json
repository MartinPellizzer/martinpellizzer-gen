    "intro": "Paspalum filiculme, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
