It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
