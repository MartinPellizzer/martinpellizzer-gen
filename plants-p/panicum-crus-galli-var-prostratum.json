    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate barnyard grass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, hairless stems that often lie flat or are slightly curled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
