It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
