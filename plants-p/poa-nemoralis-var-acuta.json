It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. It is often found in association with other woodland flora and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in these habitats."
