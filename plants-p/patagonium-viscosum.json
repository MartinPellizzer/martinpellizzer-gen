    "intro": "Patagonium viscosum, commonly known as the sticky cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and has a thick, waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Patagonium viscosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
