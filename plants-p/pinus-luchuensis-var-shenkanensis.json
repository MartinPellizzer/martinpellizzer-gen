    "intro": "Pinus luchuensis var. shenkanensis, commonly known as the Shinkanensis Japanese black pine, is a rare variant of the Japanese black pine native to the Ryukyu Islands. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20133 cm long. The plant produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
