    "intro": "Phoradendron virens, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, typically growing on oak and hickory trees. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy texture. The species is notable for its ability to form dense clusters on its host, sometimes leading to the death of the tree if the infestation is severe."
