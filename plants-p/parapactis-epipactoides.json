    "intro": "Parapactis epipactoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has long, thin roots that anchor it to the rock surface and a single, slender stem that supports its delicate, white or greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
