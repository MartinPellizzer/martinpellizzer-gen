It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
