    "intro": "Parodia occulta, commonly known as the hidden parodia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing species that prefers well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
