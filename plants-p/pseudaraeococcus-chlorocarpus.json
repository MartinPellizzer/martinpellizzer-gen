    "intro": "Pseudaraeococcus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green fruit scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its small, flattened body covered in a waxy, protective coating. The plant it infests is typically a member of the family Euphorbiaceae, such as the common croton. The insect's feeding habits can cause significant damage to the leaves and stems of the host plant. Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, nymph, and adult, with the adults being the most commonly observed form."
