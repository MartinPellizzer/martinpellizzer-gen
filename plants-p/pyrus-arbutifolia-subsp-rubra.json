    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red-leafed whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or purple color in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
