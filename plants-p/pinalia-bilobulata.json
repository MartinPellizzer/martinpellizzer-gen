    "intro": "Pinalia bilobulata, commonly known as the two-lobed pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include a slender stem and elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
