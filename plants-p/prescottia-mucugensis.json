    "intro": "Prescottia mucugensis, commonly known as the Mucug\u00ea Bird's Nest, is a unique orchid species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, bird's nest-like inflorescence, which is covered in dense, white to yellowish bracts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white with a contrasting lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
