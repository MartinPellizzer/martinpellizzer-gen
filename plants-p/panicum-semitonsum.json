    "intro": "Panicum semitonsum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its reddish-purple coloration, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes for its striking autumn color."
