    "intro": "Pleopeltis bryopoda, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure, which helps retain moisture. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is native to regions such as Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in tropical rainforest ecosystems."
