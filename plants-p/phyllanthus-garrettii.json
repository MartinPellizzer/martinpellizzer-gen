    "intro": "Phyllanthus garrettii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Phyllanthus garrettii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
