    "intro": "Polypodium macrosorum, commonly known as the giant fern or large polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
