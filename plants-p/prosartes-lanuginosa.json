    "intro": "Prosartes lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
