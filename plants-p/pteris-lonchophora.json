    "intro": "Pteris lonchophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their elegant appearance."
