    "intro": "Petrocodon chongqingensis, commonly known as the Chongqing petrocodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Chongqing, China. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
