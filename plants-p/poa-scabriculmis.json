    "intro": "Poa scabriculmis, commonly known as the roughleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered with a dense layer of stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Poa scabriculmis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
