    "intro": "Polyboea velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in disturbed or wetland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by orange to red fruits containing several seeds. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton."
