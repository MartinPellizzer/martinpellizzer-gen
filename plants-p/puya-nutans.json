    "intro": "Puya nutans, commonly known as the nodding puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy inflorescence. The plant produces a single, pendulous flower that blooms in a striking shade of red or orange, often with yellow or green streaks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Puya nutans is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
