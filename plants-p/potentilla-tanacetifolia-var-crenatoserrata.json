    "intro": "Potentilla tanacetifolia var. crenatoserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, crenate-serrate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature in colder climates."
