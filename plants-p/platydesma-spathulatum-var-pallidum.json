    "intro": "Platydesma spathulatum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale flatleaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
