    "intro": "Picris cyanocarpa, commonly known as blue-fruited wormwood, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive blue-black berries, which are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
