    "intro": "Potentilla sommerfeltii, commonly known as the Sierra lily or Sierra potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla sommerfeltii is often found in rocky soils and open slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
