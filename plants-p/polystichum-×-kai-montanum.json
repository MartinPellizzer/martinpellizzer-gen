    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 kai-montanum, commonly known as the hybrid Himalayan shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum hani and Polystichum montanum. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
