    "intro": "Phylica hirta, commonly known as the silver bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Phylica hirta is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
