    "intro": "Polypodium glaucinum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually divided into segments with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) coating on the underside. Polypodium glaucinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
