    "intro": "Pteris semihastata, commonly known as the half-sheath fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often serrated fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Its delicate, feathery foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
