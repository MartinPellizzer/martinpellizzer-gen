    "intro": "Psychotria liberica var. micropuberula, commonly known as the micropuberula Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, short pubescence. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical *Psychotria liberica*, including its smaller leaf size and distinct pubescence pattern."
