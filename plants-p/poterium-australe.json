    "intro": "Poterium australe, commonly known as the Australian sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Poterium australe is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
