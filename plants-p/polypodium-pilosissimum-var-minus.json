    "intro": "Polypodium pilosissimum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser hairy shield fern, is a variant of the hairy shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
