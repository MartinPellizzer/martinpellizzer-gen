    "intro": "Plantago atrata subsp. fuscescens, commonly known as the black plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, three-lobed capsule, which helps in seed dispersal."
