It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive, serrated, and often arching appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the fern family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture."
