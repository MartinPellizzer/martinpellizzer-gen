    "intro": "Piper sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and it is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. Piper sciaphilum is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its botanical features make it well adapted to low-light conditions and high humidity."
