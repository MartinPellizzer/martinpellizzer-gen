    "intro": "Psychotria occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian arrow poison or devil's breath, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant contains various alkaloids, including psychotrine, which has been used traditionally for its psychoactive properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its striking red flowers and toxic nature make it both ecologically significant and potentially dangerous to humans and animals."
