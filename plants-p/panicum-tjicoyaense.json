    "intro": "Panicum tjicoyaense, commonly known as the Tjicoya panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
