    "intro": "Paronychia depressa var. brevicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-cushioned sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
