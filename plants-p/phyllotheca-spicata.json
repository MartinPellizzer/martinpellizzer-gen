    "intro": "Phyllotheca spicata, commonly known as the spike-leaved phyllotheca, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Phyllotheca spicata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
