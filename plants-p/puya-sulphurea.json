    "intro": "Puya sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears bright yellow flowers. The plant produces a large rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant can live for several decades before it dies after flowering. Puya sulphurea is known for its dramatic appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
