    "intro": "Platanthera preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single spike of flowers with numerous small, hooded blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
