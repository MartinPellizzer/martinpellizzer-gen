    "intro": "Pteris caudata, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its long, trailing fronds that resemble the tail of a horse, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, bipinnate fronds with a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist soil. Pteris caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens."
