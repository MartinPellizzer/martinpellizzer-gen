    "intro": "Polystichum boboense var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polystichum. It is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically shorter than those of its parent species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
