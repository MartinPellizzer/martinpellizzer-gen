    "intro": "Phyllocactus ruestii, commonly known as the Ruest's phyllocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
