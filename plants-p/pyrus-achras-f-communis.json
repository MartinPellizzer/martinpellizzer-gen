    "intro": "Pyrus achras f. communis, commonly known as the common pear. This cultivar is a variant of the pear tree, characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, sweeter fruits compared to its wild relatives. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces ornamental white flowers in spring, followed by edible fruit that ripens in late summer. Its hardiness and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and small-scale fruit production."
