    "intro": "Passiflora perpera, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a central crown of filaments and a crown of sepals. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or in jams. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. Passiflora perpera is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
