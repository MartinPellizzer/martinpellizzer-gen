    "intro": "Pinus arizonica subsp. ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas's Apache pine, is a subspecies native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of its close relatives. The tree produces cones that are woody and typically remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against fire and drought. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of desert and mountain ecosystems."
