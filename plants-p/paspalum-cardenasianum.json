    "intro": "Paspalum cardenasianum, commonly known as the Cardenas grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
