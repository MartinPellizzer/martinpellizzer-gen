    "intro": "Polemonium antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Polemonium antarcticum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
