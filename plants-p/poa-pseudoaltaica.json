    "intro": "Poa pseudoaltaica, commonly known as the Altai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and steppe environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool temperatures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well-adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitudes and low nutrient soils. Poa pseudoaltaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
