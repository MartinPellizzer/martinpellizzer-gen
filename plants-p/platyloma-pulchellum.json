    "intro": "Platyloma pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a leathery texture and a dark, almost black upper surface. The lower surface is covered in fine, branched filaments called rhizines, which help anchor it to surfaces like bark or rock. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to moist, nutrient-poor substrates."
