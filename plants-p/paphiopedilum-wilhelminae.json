    "intro": "Paphiopedilum wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often humid and shaded environment. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
