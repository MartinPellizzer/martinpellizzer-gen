    "intro": "Paraphalaenopsis thorntonii, commonly known as the Thornton's orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
