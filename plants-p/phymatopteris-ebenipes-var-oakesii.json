    "intro": "Phymatopteris ebenipes var. oakesii, commonly known as the Oakes' shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
