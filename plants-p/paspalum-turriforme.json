The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, with a bluish-green coloration. Paspalum turriforme is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a groundcover due to its hardy nature."
