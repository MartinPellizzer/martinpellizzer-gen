    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. uncinata, commonly known as the Scots pine variety with hooked needles, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched, needle-like leaves that are typically curved or hooked at the tips. The plant produces cones that are usually smaller and more clustered compared to the typical Scots pine. It thrives in sandy or acidic soils and is often found in forested areas with a temperate climate. This variety plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species."
