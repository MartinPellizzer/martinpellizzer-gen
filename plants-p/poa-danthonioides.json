    "intro": "Poa danthonioides, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa danthonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
