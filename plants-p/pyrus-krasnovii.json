    "intro": "Pyrus krasnovii, commonly known as Krasnov's pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like apple, is edible and has a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
