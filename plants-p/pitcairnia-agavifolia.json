    "intro": "Pitcairnia agavifolia, commonly known as the sword leaf pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its long, sword-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its rosette structure helps it collect and store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. Pitcairnia agavifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
