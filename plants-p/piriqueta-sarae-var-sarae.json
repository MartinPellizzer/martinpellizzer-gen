    "intro": "Piriqueta sarae var. sarae, commonly known as the Sara's piriqueta, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in primary forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
