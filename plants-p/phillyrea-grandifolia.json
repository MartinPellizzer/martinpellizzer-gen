    "intro": "Phillyrea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea grandifolia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal flowering."
