    "intro": "Phymatopteris engleri, commonly known as the Engle's wallriven fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, clustered frond structure. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or lobed margin. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
