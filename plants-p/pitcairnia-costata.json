    "intro": "Pitcairnia costata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, waxy, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for its natural habitat in humid, shaded environments. Pitcairnia costata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and showy blooms."
