    "intro": "Pneumonanthe rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes various carnivorous plants. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Pneumonanthe rusbyi thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight."
