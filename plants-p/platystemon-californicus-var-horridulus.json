    "intro": "Platystemon californicus var. horridulus, commonly known as the California fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a distinctive reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of habitats, including meadows and dry slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
