    "intro": "Polypodium plebeium, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. This plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it grows in temperate and subtropical climates. Polypodium plebeium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
