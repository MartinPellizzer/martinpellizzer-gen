    "intro": "Perymenium viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees through its haustoria. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various bird species. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
