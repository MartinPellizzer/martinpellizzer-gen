    "intro": "Piper bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's pepper, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Ecuador and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it bears small, peppery berries. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
