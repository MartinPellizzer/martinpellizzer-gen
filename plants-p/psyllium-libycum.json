    "intro": "Psyllium libycum, commonly known as the desert psyllium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a mucilaginous seed coat that swells when soaked in water, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. It thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. Its historical use dates back to ancient civilizations for both medicinal and culinary purposes."
