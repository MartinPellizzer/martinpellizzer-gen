    "intro": "Poranthera microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
