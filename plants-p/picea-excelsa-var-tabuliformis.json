    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. tabuliformis, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, conical crown, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, providing a striking visual contrast against the rocky terrain. Its cones are typically slender and hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils and its potential use in horticulture."
