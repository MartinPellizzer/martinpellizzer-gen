    "intro": "Polypodium saxatile, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of rocks or trees without being parasitic. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh, rocky habitat. Polypodium saxatile is native to regions in the Americas and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
