    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium var. obtuseserratum, commonly known as the broad-toothed holly fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into broad, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The varietal name *obtuseserratum* refers to the bluntly serrated leaf margins, distinguishing it from other polypodium species."
