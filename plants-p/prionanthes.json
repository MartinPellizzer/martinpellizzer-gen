    "intro": "Prionanthes, commonly known as the false nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. They produce small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences. The fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, and they contain several seeds. Prionanthes species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
