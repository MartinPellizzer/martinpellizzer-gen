    "intro": "Poarchon coeruleus, commonly known as the sky-blue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a distinctive white lip, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Poarchon coeruleus is considered a conservation concern."
