    "intro": "Pedilanthus macradenius, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, branching stems that are covered in a waxy, pale green coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
