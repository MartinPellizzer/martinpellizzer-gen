It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs with slender stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in composite heads, resembling those of true dandelions. Psilonema species are often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. They are characterized by their delicate foliage and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
