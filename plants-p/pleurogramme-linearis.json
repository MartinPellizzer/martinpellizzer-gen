    "intro": "Pleurogramme linearis, commonly known as the linear pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, making it a distinctive member of the water fern family."
