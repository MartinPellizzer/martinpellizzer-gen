It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
