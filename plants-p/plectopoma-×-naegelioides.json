    "intro": "Plectopoma \u00d7 naegelioides, commonly known as the hybrid sea snail, is a species of gastropod mollusk in the family Tornidae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Plectopoma naegeli and Plectopoma variabilis, both of which are found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is typically found on rocky substrates. Its shell is characterized by a spiral pattern and a smooth, glossy surface, making it distinct from its parent species."
