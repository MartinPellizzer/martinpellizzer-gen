    "intro": "Piper delatum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by tiny, peppery berries. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy surface and a slightly aromatic scent. Piper delatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
