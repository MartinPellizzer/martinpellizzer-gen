    "intro": "Pteroceras semiteretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pteroceras, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Pterocarpaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four to five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as rocky outcrops or sandy soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
