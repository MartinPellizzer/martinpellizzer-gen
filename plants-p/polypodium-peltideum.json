    "intro": "Polypodium peltideum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium peltideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
