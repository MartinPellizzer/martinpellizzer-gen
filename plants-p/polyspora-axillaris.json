    "intro": "Polyspora axillaris, commonly known as the axillary polyspora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters along the stem, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and as a houseplant."
