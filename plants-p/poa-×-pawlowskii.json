    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 pawlowskii, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically forms a sod-like structure, making it suitable for turfgrass applications. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and is propagated vegetatively."
