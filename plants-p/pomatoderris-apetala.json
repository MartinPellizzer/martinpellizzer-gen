    "intro": "Pomatoderris apetala, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. The ghost gum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
