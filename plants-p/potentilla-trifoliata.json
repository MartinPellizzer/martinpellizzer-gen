    "intro": "Potentilla trifoliata, commonly known as three-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Potentilla trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
