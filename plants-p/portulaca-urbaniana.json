    "intro": "Portulaca urbaniana, commonly known as the moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to tolerate drought conditions is due to its thick, waxy leaves that store water. Portulaca urbaniana is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin irritations and as a diuretic."
