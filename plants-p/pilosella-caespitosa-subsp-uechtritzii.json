    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa subsp. uechtritzii, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and a central disk. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
