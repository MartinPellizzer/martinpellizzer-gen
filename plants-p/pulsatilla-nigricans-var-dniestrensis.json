    "intro": "Pulsatilla nigricans var. dniestrensis, commonly known as the Dniester pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between March and May. The plant features a short, upright stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in soft, silky hairs. Native to the Dniester River region in eastern Europe, it thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
