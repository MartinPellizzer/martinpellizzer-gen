    "intro": "Pastinaca denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bur marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and heart-shaped leaves with jagged edges. The plant typically grows in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive toothed foliage, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The plant is also sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
