    "intro": "Pneumatopteris venulosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water, aiding in light absorption and photosynthesis. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient uptake. Pneumatopteris venulosa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
