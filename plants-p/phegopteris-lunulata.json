    "intro": "Phegopteris lunulata, commonly known as the moonwort fern, is a small, delicate fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris lunulata is a primitive fern species with a unique morphology and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
