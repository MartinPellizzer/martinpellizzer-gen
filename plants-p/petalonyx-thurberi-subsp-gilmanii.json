    "intro": "Petalonyx thurberi subsp. gilmanii, commonly known as the Gilman's petalonyx, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
