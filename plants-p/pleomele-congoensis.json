It belongs to the family Agavaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often adorned with spines. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
