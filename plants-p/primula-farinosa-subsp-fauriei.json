It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it the species name \"farinosa,\" which means \"flour-like.\" The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and valuable species in alpine flora studies."
