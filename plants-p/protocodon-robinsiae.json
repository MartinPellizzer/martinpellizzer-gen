    "intro": "Protocodon robinsiae, commonly known as the Robinsia protocodon, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, small, and delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
