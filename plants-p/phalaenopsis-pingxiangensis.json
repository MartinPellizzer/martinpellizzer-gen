It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers with a slight pinkish tinge. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts."
