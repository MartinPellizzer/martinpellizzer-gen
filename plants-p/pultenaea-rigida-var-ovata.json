    "intro": "Pultenaea rigida var. ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, often zigzagging leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are arranged in racemes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and dry inland environments. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Pultenaea rigida."
