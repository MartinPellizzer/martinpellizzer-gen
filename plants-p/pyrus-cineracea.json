    "intro": "Pyrus cineracea, commonly known as the ashleaf pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its distinctive ash-like leaves that are finely toothed and grayish in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Pyrus cineracea is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in traditional cuisines."
