    "intro": "Pleopeltis friedrichsthaliana, commonly known as the Friedrichsthaliana fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
