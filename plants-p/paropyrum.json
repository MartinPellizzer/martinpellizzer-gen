It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Paropyrum thrives in marshy or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams. It is known for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
