    "intro": "Picea sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the colder regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Picea sibirica is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
