    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its reddish stems and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its fine, bluish-green leaves are often covered with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, contributing to its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
