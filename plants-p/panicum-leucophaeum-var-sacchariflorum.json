    "intro": "Panicum leucophaeum var. sacchariflorum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white underside on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in full sun and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. It produces fluffy, pale blue to white panicles that bloom in late summer. Silver bluestem is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
