    "intro": "Polypogon elongatus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover in native plant gardens."
