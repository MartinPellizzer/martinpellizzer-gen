    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese goatweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
