    "intro": "Peucedanum coriaceum subsp. pospichalii, commonly known as the Balkan cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, somewhat peppery scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins and along stream banks. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
