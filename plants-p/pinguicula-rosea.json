    "intro": "Pinguicula rosea, commonly known as the pink butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate pink or purple flowers during the growing season, which typically occurs in spring. Pinguicula rosea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy areas. Its botanical features make it a fascinating example of adaptation in nutrient-poor habitats."
