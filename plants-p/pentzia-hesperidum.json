    "intro": "Pentzia hesperidum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the edges of coastal dunes. It has adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Pentzia hesperidum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
