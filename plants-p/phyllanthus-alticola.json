    "intro": "Phyllanthus alticola, commonly known as the rock pear, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that resemble pears. It has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Phyllanthus alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
