    "intro": "Psychotria erratica, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It often grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is sometimes found in disturbed areas. Psychotria erratica is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
