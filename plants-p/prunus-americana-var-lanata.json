    "intro": "Prunus americana var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or gray pubescence covering the stems and young leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are oval to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and flowering display."
