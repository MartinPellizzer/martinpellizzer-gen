    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. myrtillifolium, commonly known as the blue mist fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
