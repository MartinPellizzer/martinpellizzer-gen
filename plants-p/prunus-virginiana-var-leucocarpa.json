    "intro": "Prunus virginiana var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces small, yellowish-red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife but contain cyanogenic glycosides, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in younger trees. This variety is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological balance."
