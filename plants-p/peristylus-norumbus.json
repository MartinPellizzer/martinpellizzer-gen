    "intro": "Peristylus norumbus, commonly known as the flame lily, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Peristylus norumbus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
