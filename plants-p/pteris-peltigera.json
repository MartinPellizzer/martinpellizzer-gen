    "intro": "Pteris peltigera, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are typically bright green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention."
