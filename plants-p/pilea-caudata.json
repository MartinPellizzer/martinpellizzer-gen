    "intro": "Pilea caudata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features rounded, succulent leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal indoor plant, often grown in hanging baskets or as a tabletop specimen. Pilea caudata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health and appearance."
