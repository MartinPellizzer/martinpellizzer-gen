    "intro": "Pitcairnia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia brevifolia thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests."
