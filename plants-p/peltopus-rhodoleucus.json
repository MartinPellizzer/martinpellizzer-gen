    "intro": "Peltopus rhodoleucus, commonly known as the red-leaved peltopus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent during the cooler months. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
