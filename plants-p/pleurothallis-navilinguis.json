    "intro": "Pleurothallis navilinguis, commonly known as the golden beard orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
