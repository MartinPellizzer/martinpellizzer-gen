    "intro": "Psephellus adjaricus, commonly known as the Caucasian rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are violet to purple in color, with five petals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
