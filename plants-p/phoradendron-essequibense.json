    "intro": "Phoradendron essequibense, commonly known as the Caribbean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean region. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as mangroves and other tropical hardwoods, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Despite being a parasite, it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
