    "intro": "Pitcairnia aurantiaca, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that range from orange to red, resembling the appearance of a flower. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central tank that collects water, supporting various forms of life. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
