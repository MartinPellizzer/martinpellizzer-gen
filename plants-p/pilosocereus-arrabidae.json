    "intro": "Pilosocereus arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Portugal and Spain. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its structure is adapted to minimize water loss, with a thick, waxy cuticle and spines that provide shade and protection. Pilosocereus arrabidae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in dry gardens and collections."
