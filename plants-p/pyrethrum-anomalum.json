It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated for its potential in pest control due to its natural insecticidal properties."
