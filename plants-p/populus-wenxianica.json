    "intro": "Populus wenxianica, commonly known as Wenxian poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green bark. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus wenxianica is considered a conservation concern."
