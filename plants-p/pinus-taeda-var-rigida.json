    "intro": "Pinus taeda var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid southern pine, is a variant of the loblolly pine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright needles and dense, compact growth habit. The plant exhibits a conical shape with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the fall. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its distinctive appearance."
