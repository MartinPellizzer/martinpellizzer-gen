    "intro": "Phoradendron antillarum f. longum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Caribbean and Central America. It has a distinctive appearance with elongated, slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow, containing one or two seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
