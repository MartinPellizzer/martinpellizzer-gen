    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. coenocantabrica, commonly known as the Atlantic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky habitats and is often found near the sea. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a unique example of plant life in harsh environments."
