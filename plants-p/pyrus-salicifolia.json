    "intro": "Pyrus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate and often have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is sometimes grown in gardens and orchards."
