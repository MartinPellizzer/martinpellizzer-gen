    "intro": "Potentilla argaea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
