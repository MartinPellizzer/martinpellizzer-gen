    "intro": "Platanthera volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific volcanic regions. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its survival is closely tied to the unique geology of its habitat, which includes volcanic rock and soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
