    "intro": "Planchonella rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved sand apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, yellow fruits with a gritty texture. Its fruit is edible, though it has a strong, sometimes bitter flavor, and is used in traditional cuisine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
