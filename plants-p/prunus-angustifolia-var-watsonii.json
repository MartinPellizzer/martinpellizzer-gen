    "intro": "Prunus angustifolia var. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's narrowleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, often multi-branched stems with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, elliptic to lanceolate, and have a narrow, elongated shape with finely serrated margins. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge, followed by small, dark red to black berries in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
