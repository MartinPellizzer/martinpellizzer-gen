    "intro": "Pinguicula louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or wetlands. Pinguicula louisii is an important species for studying carnivorous plant adaptations and ecosystem dynamics."
