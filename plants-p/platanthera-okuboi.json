    "intro": "Platanthera okuboi, commonly known as the Okub\u014d lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green leaves and a dense, grass-like inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered."
