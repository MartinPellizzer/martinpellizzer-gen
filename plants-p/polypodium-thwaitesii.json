    "intro": "Polypodium thwaitesii, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and Indonesia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rhizome is thick and woody, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and store moisture. Polypodium thwaitesii is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests."
