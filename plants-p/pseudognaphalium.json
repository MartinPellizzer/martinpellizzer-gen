It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Pseudognaphalium species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
