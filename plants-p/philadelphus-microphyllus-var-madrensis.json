    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus var. madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1os hybrid philadelphus, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, foliage-rich appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
