    "intro": "Polypodium pustulatum var. scandens, commonly known as the climbing polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year's growth being sterile and the second year's producing spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and can climb or spread along the ground, allowing it to colonize various substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
