    "intro": "Pachygenium laminatum, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a unique plant characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that resemble parchment. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that create a dense, layered appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its distinctive foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
