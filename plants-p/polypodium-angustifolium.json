    "intro": "Polypodium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall-rue, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
