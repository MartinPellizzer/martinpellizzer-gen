    "intro": "Picris nilotica, commonly known as Egyptian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and alternate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its fruit is a slender, ribbed achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Picris nilotica is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
