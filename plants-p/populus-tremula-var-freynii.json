    "intro": "Populus tremula var. freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's aspen, is a variant of the European aspen. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its finely toothed leaves and a distinctive, often zigzagging stem. The leaves are typically smaller and more oval than those of the typical Populus tremula. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale gray. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe."
