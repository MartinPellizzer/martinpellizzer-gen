    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper subsp. hispida, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins, and they are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
