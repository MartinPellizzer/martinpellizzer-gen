    "intro": "Poa alpigena subsp. colpodea, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
