    "intro": "Pulmonaria mollis subsp. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a bluish-gray coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
