    "intro": "Pleione prolifera, commonly known as the orchid of the mountain, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the high elevations of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring, featuring a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested mountain regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form clumps, and it has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its beauty and rarity, Pleione prolifera is highly sought after in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
