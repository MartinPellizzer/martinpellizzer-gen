It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its fruit, which develops into a woody capsule containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
