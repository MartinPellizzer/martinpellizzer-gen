    "intro": "Puya formosa, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, protective structure around its central flower stalk. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Puya formosa is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of the Andean landscape."
