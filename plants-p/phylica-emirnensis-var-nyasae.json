It is characterized by its striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps conserve moisture. This species is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
