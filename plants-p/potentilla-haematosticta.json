    "intro": "Potentilla haematosticta, commonly known as the bloodstained cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often reddish in color, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla haematosticta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
