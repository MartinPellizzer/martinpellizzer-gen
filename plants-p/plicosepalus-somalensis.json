    "intro": "Plicosepalus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali plicosepalus, is a rare flowering plant native to Somalia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, plicate (folded) sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
