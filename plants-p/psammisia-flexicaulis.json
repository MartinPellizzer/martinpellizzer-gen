    "intro": "Psammisia flexicaulis, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as high temperatures and low moisture. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its narrow, fleshy leaves reduce water loss through transpiration. The small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or green, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects."
