    "intro": "Polyosma laetevirens var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mountain holly, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
