    "intro": "Pyrethrum inodorum var. duplicatum, commonly known as double-flowered pyrethrum, is a cultivar of the pyrethrum plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms of white to pale yellow petals, which give it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic value and has mild insect-repelling properties. This variety is particularly valued for its showy flowers and ease of cultivation."
