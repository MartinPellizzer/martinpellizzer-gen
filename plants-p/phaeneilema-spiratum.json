    "intro": "Phaeneilema spiratum, commonly known as the spiral spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers along the stem, which gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant, spider-like blooms in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
