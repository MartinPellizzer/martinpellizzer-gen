    "intro": "Poa strictula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, perennial plant characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically forms compact clumps and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa strictula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures due to its hardiness and fine texture."
