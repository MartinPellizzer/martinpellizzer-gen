    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are elliptical and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy spring blooms."
