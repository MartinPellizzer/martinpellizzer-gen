    "intro": "Pouteria glomerata var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a toxic outer shell and are harvested for their nutritional value. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and requires a warm, stable climate. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
