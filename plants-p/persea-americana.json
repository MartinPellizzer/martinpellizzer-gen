    "intro": "Persea americana, commonly known as the avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It produces a large, pear-shaped fruit with a smooth, thin skin and a creamy, nutrient-rich pulp. The fruit contains a single large seed, or pit, surrounded by a fatty, oily mesocarp. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it an important crop in both culinary and agricultural contexts."
