    "intro": "Perezia conaicaensis, commonly known as the Cauca perezia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Perezia conaicaensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
