    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its striking, pinkish-white flower spikes that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many areas."
