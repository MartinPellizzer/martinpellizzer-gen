    "intro": "Pteris degoesi, commonly known as the Dego's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris degoesi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
