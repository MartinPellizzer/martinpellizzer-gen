    "intro": "Paspalum stoloniferum, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Paspalum stoloniferum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
