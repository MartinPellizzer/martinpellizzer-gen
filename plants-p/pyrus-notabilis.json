    "intro": "Pyrus notabilis, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, aromatic fruit that ripens in late summer. The fruit is typically small, with a pale yellow skin and a soft, juicy flesh. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates."
