    "intro": "Parietaria circeifolia, commonly known as the rock mallows, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny areas. Parietaria circeifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle flowering."
