    "intro": "Polypodium alsophilicola, commonly known as the coastal huperzia, is a fern species native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist, shaded environments along the Atlantic coast. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops where it is exposed to salt spray. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
