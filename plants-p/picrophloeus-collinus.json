    "intro": "Picrophloeus collinus, commonly known as the red-flowered sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in the biodiversity of its native habitat. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
