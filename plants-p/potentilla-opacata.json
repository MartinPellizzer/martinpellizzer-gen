    "intro": "Potentilla opacata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
