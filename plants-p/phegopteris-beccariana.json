It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The leaves are usually bright green and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
