    "intro": "Penstemon deustus var. heterander, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
