    "intro": "Philodendron simonianum, commonly known as the Simonsen's philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are not typically visible above ground. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor or climb supporting structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil."
