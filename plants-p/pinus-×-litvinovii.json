    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov pine, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus sibirica and Pinus pumila. It is a low-growing shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of its parent species. Its cones are usually small and conical, with scales that open to release seeds. This hybrid is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils."
