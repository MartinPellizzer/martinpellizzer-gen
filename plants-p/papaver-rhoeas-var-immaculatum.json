    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The flowers are simple, with five broad petals and a prominent central stigma, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is less common than the typical red poppy and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
