    "intro": "Poa dolichachyra var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered tussock grass, is a variant of the tussock grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
