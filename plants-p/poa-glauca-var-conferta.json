    "intro": "Poa glauca var. conferta, commonly known as the dense bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense mats, enhancing its erosion control capabilities. The flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ornamental value."
