    "intro": "Peucedanum stepposum, commonly known as steppe angelica, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a distinctive branched structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The roots of Peucedanum stepposum are often harvested for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine."
