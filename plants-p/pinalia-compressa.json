    "intro": "Pinalia compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf pinyon, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife. Pinalia compressa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
