    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 robusta, commonly known as the American poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European aspen (Populus tremula) and the North American balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in reforestation efforts and urban landscapes. Populus \u00d7 robusta is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
