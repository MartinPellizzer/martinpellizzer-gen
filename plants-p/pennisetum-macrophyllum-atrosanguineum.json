    "intro": "Pennisetum macrophyllum-atrosanguineum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright clumps of narrow, silver-green leaves that turn a vibrant purple-red in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white inflorescences that add a dramatic visual element to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscapes in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide texture and color throughout the growing season."
