    "intro": "Potamogeton rotundifolius, commonly known as round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has broad, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic organisms and help stabilize sediment. However, it can also become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly."
