    "intro": "Polypodium prolongatum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Polypodium prolongatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and rainforests."
