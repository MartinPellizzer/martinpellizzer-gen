    "intro": "Poinciana placida, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bract clusters that resemble flames, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has pinnate leaves that are bipinnate, with small, delicate leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Poinciana placida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
