    "intro": "Primula sylvestris, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are often adorned with a distinctive yellowish-green throat, and it is known for its early emergence in the spring season. Primula sylvestris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators."
