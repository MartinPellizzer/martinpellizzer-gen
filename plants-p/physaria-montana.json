It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Physaria montana is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and rocky slopes."
