    "intro": "Polypodium robustum subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, with a rough, serrated margin. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to store water and nutrients."
