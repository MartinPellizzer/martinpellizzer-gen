    "intro": "Psilothamnus adpressifolius, commonly known as the flat-leafed psilothamnus, is a small, low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically features dense, compact growth with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. The species is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
