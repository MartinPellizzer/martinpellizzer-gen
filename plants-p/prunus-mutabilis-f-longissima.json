    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. longissima, commonly known as the long-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus mutabilis species, which is native to Japan. This variety is characterized by its elongated, slender petals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical double-flowered form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers in early spring, which gradually change color as the season progresses. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its beautiful blooms and unique floral structure."
