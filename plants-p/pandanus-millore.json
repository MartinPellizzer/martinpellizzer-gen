    "intro": "Pandanus millore, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its roots are valued for their medicinal properties. Pandanus millore thrives in coastal areas and is often found in wetlands or near water sources."
