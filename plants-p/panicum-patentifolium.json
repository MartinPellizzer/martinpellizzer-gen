    "intro": "Panicum patentifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, slender stalks with wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
