    "intro": "Pteris rigidula, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pteris rigidula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ability to thrive in wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
