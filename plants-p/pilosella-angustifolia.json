    "intro": "Pilosella angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf goatherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in early summer. Pilosella angustifolia is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
