    "intro": "Phlomis urticifolia, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its name \"urticifolia\" refers to the stinging, urticating hairs on its leaves, which can cause skin irritation."
