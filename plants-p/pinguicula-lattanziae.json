    "intro": "Pinguicula lattanziae, commonly known as the Lattanzia butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
