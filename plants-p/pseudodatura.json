    "intro": "Pseudodatura, commonly known as devil's trumpets, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often showy, tubular flowers that are typically red, purple, or yellow. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Pseudodatura species are known for their toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. The plants are often grown as ornamentals due to their unique appearance, though caution is necessary due to their toxicity."
