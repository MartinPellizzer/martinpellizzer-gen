    "intro": "Polystichum tacticopterum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and dark green fronds that often have a golden hue along the midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
