    "intro": "Panicum carautae, commonly known as the Carauta grass, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, lowland areas and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many other grass species."
