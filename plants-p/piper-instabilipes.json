    "intro": "Piper instabilipes, commonly known as the unstable pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Due to its delicate and often unpredictable growth habits, it is considered a rare and challenging species to cultivate."
