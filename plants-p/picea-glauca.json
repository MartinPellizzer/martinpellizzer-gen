    "intro": "Picea glauca, commonly known as white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and silvery-blue needles that are coated with a waxy cuticle. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to cold climates. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites. White spruce is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ecological importance."
