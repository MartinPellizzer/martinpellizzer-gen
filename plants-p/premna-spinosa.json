    "intro": "Premna spinosa, commonly known as the hairy fig or Indian nettle, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Premna spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
