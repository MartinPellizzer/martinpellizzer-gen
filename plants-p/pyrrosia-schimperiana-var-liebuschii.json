    "intro": "Pyrrosia schimperiana var. liebuschii, commonly known as the Liebusch's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
