    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. collina, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardiness. The subspecies collina is distinguished by its slightly more robust stems and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of Potentilla argentea."
