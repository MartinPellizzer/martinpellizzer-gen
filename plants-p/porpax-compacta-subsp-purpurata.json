    "intro": "Porpax compacta subsp. purpurata, commonly known as the purple compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
