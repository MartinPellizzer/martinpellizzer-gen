    "intro": "Parosela trichocalyx, commonly known as the white parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name \"trichocalyx,\" meaning \"hairy calyx.\" It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Parosela trichocalyx is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its arid habitat."
