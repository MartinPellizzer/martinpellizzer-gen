    "intro": "Platyspermum aureum, commonly known as the golden leaf plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow leaves that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it relatively drought-tolerant. Platyspermum aureum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
