It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by white, sweet-smelling fruits. The fruit is typically pear-shaped, with a thin, smooth skin and a crisp, juicy flesh. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also cultivated for its edible fruit."
