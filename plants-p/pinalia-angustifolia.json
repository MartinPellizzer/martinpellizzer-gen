    "intro": "Pinalia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pinalia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
