    "intro": "Pimelea brevifolia var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming from late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. This plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
