    "intro": "Physocarpus opulifolius var. nanus, commonly known as dwarf ninebark, is a compact shrub native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely arranged along the stems, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are followed by ornamental, red or orange berries. It is well-suited for garden use due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its compact size makes it ideal for borders, rock gardens, or as a specimen plant."
