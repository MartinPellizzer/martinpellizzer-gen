    "intro": "Polypodium angulatum, commonly known as the angled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a zigzag or angular appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Polypodium angulatum prefers indirect light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
