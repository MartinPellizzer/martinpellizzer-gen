    "intro": "Potentilla tristis f. ciliata, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely ciliate margins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
