    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides var. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature typical of the genus Pedicularis, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. This variety is notable for its bright color and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
