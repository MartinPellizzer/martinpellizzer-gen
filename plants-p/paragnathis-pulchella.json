It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural wetland environments."
