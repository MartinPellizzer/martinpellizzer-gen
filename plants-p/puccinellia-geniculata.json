    "intro": "Puccinellia geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or jointed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes, marshes, and other wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is known for its ability to tolerate salt and water stress. Puccinellia geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
