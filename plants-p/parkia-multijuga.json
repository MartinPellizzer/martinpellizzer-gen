    "intro": "Parkia multijuga, commonly known as the African tamarind tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous, acidic pulp. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
