    "intro": "Philodendron clementis, commonly known as the pink-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive pink veins that contrast beautifully with the foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Philodendron clementis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
