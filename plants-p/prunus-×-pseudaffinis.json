    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 pseudaffinis, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other apricot varieties. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its spring blossoms. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal."
