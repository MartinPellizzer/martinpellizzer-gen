    "intro": "Panicum plicatulum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and prefers moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets. Panicum plicatulum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
