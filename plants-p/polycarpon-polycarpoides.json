It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Polycarpon polycarpoides is known for its ability to capture small aquatic organisms using its specialized bladder-like structures."
