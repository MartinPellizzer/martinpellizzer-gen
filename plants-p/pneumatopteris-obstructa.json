    "intro": "Pneumatopteris obstructa, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Pneumatopteris obstructa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
