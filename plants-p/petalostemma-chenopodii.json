It is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to orange-red as they mature. These fruits are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
