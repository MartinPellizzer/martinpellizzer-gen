    "intro": "Poa arctica var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silvery-blue foliage that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
