    "intro": "Puccinellia palustris subsp. festuciformis, commonly known as marsh muirgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tufted growth form and grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and cylindrical. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to submerged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
