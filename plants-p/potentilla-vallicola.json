    "intro": "Potentilla vallicola, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Potentilla vallicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
