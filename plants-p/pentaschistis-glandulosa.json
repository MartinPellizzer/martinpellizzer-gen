    "intro": "Pentaschistis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant's leaves are often covered in sticky secretions, which help deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
