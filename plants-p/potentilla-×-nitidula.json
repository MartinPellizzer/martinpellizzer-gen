    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 nitidula, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
