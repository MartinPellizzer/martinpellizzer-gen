    "intro": "Palicourea tunjaensis, commonly known as the Tunja beauty, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies. However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
