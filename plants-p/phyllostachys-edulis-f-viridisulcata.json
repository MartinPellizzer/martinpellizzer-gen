    "intro": "Phyllostachys edulis f. viridisulcata, commonly known as the green-groove bamboo, is a variant of the common bamboo species, Phyllostachys edulis. It is characterized by its distinctive green, almost metallic sheen on the culms, which sets it apart from the typical yellow or green bamboo varieties. The plant is a clump-forming perennial grass that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with slender, hollow stems that are often used in construction and crafts. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a lush, dense appearance throughout the growing season. This bamboo is well-suited to temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal."
