    "intro": "Pteris tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. Pteris tenuis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
