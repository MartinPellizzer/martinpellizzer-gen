    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea subsp. trituberculata, commonly known as the Indian cress or mossy purslane, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, prostrate stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. The species is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive drought conditions."
