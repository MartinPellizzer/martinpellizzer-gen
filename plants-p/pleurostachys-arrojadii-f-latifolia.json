    "intro": "Pleurostachys arrojadii f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
