    "intro": "Philadelphus tomentosus, commonly known as the fuzzy mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and attractive foliage."
