    "intro": "Polypodium triangulare, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into three lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
