    "intro": "Piper arboreum subsp. holguinianum, commonly known as the Holguinian pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by reddish-black berries that are edible but have a peppery flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
