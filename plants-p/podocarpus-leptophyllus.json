    "intro": "Podocarpus leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaved podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
