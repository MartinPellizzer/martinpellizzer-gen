    "intro": "Primula veris subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to the typical Primula veris. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
