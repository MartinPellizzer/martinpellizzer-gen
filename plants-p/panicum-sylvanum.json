    "intro": "Panicum sylvanum, commonly known as woodland panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce delicate, feathery flowers. Panicum sylvanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
