    "intro": "Populus nigra var. caudina, commonly known as the weeping black poplar, is a striking tree characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. It is a variant of the black poplar, native to Europe and parts of Western Asia, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a rough texture. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its unique appearance and adaptability."
