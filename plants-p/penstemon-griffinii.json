    "intro": "Penstemon griffinii, commonly known as the Griffin's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Penstemon griffinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
