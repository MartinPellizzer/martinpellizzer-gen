    "intro": "Panicum aulaxanthus, commonly known as the silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-branched inflorescences that are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental grass. Its botanical features make it suitable for erosion control and as a low-maintenance garden plant."
