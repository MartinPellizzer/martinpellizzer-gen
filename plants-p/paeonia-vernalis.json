    "intro": "Paeonia vernalis, commonly known as the spring peony, is a deciduous perennial shrub native to eastern and central Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive winter. Paeonia vernalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant spring display."
