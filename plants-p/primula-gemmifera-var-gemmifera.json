    "intro": "Primula gemmifera var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmed primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its unique characteristic is the presence of gemmae, which are tiny plantlets that form on the flower stems, allowing for vegetative propagation. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
