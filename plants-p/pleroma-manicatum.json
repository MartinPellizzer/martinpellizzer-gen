    "intro": "Pleroma manicatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields. Pleroma manicatum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
