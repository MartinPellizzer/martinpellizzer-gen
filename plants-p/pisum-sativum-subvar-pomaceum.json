    "intro": "Pisum sativum subvar. pomaceum, commonly known as the Armenian pea, is a subspecies of the common pea that is native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often yellow or white flowers. The pods are typically shorter and less inflated compared to those of the common garden pea, and the seeds are smaller and more angular. This subspecies is valued for its adaptability to harsh climates and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds. It shares many botanical features with other pea species but exhibits distinct morphological traits that set it apart."
