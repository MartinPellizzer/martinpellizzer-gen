    "intro": "Polypodium mazei, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other polypodium species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing leaves. Polypodium mazei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
