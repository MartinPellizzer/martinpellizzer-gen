It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are usually narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.
