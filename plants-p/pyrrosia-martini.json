    "intro": "Pyrrosia martini, commonly known as the Martini's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has pinnately divided fronds with a leathery texture and dark green, glossy leaves. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Pyrrosia martini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
