    "intro": "Pleurothallis niveoglobula, commonly known as the white globular pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant prefers cool, humid conditions and is often found growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
