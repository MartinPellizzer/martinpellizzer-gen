    "intro": "Pleurothallis simplicicaulis, commonly known as the simple-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. This orchid is often found in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
