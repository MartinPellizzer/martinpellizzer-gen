    "intro": "Panmorphia cuspidata, commonly known as the needle-tipped panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
