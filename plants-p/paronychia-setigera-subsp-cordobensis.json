    "intro": "Paronychia setigera subsp. cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
