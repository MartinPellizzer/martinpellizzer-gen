It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other Prunus species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers have a delicate fragrance and are popular in traditional Chinese gardens."
