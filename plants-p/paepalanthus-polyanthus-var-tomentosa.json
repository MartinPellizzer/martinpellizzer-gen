    "intro": "Paepalanthus polyanthus var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pincushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense clusters of spiny stems covered in a thick, white, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
