    "intro": "Pilea nokozanensis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature pilea, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, which appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its compact size and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
