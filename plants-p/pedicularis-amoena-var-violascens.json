    "intro": "Pedicularis amoena var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is distinguished by its more intense violet coloration compared to other varieties of Pedicularis."
