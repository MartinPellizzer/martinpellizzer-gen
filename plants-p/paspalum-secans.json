    "intro": "Paspalum secans, commonly known as rough paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalum secans is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and resilience."
