    "intro": "Poa iberica, commonly known as the Iberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Poa iberica is often found in specialized habitats, making it an important component of the region's biodiversity."
