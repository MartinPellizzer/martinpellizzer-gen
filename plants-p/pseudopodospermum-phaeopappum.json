It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a clustered inflorescence. Its distinctive brown pappus, a feathery structure, aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils."
