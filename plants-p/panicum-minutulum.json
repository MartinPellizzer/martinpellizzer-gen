    "intro": "Panicum minutulum, commonly known as little panicgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist to mesic environments. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with small, spikelet-based inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and fine, hairy texture. Panicum minutulum is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a food source for small insects and birds."
