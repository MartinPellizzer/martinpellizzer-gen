    "intro": "Polystichum incisopinnulum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum incisopinnulum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
