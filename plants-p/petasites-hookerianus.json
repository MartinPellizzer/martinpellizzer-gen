    "intro": "Petasites hookerianus, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, and its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Petasites hookerianus is also known for its edible rhizomes, which have been used in traditional cuisines."
