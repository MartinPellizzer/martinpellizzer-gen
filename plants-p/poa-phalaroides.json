    "intro": "Poa phalaroides, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa phalaroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils."
