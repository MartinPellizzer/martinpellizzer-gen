    "intro": "Psittacanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy texture, and they are arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for cultivation in arid environments."
