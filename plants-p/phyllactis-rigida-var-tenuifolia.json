    "intro": "Phyllactis rigida var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyllactis, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, often yellowish or greenish, latex-filled structures called cyathia. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is native to regions of southern Africa. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
