    "intro": "Poa dovrensis, commonly known as the Dovren's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa dovrensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
