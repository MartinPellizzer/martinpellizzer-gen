    "intro": "Poa flexuosa subsp. consauliae, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically containing two to three flowering branches. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
