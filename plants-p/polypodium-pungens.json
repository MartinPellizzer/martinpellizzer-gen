    "intro": "Polypodium pungens, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Polypodium pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
