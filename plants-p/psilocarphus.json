    "intro": "Psilocarphus, commonly known as the \"ghost mushroom,\" is a genus of fungi within the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter. They are characterized by their delicate, often pale or ghostly-colored caps and slender stems. Psilocarphus species are generally non-toxic but are sometimes mistaken for edible mushrooms due to their subtle appearance. Their ecological role includes contributing to the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems."
