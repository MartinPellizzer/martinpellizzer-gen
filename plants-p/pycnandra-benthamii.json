    "intro": "Pycnandra benthamii, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and carving, though it is now protected in many regions."
