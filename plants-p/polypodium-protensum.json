    "intro": "Polypodium protensum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 60 cm in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium protensum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
