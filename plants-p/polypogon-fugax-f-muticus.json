    "intro": "Polypogon fugax f. muticus, commonly known as the silent panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies f. muticus is distinguished by its reduced flowering structures and a more compact growth form compared to the typical form of Polypogon fugax."
