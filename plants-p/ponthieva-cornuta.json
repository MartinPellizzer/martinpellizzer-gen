    "intro": "Ponthieva cornuta, commonly known as the horned ponthieva, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, often forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas in still or slow-moving waters. Ponthieva cornuta is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
