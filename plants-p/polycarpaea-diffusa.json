    "intro": "Polycarpaea diffusa, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap and showy, night-blooming flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and often twining. Polycarpaea diffusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
