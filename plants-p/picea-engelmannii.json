    "intro": "Picea engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, sharp, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests and subalpine zones. The Engelmann spruce plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native environments."
