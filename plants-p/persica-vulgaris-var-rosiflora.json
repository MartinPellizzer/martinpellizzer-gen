    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. rosiflora, commonly known as the Rosa floribunda, is a variant of the domesticated peach tree characterized by its ornamental flowering traits. This variety is notable for its profuse blooming of pink to white flowers, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a broad, spreading canopy, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their beauty and fragrance. However, it is less commonly cultivated for fruit production compared to other peach varieties."
