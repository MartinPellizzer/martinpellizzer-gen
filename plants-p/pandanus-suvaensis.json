    "intro": "Pandanus suvaensis, commonly known as the Suyas Island pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be processed into materials used for weaving. Pandanus suvaensis plays an important ecological and cultural role in its native regions."
