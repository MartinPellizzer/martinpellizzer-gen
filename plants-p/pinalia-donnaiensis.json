    "intro": "Pinalia donnaiensis, commonly known as the Donnaiensis pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
