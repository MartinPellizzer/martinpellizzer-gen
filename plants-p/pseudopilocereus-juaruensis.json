    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus juaruensis, commonly known as the Juaru cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are cylindrical and can store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
