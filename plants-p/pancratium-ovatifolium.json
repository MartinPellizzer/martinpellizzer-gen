    "intro": "Pancratium ovatifolium, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, fragrant flower with six petals and three sepals, which are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing in sandy soils near the shoreline. Pancratium ovatifolium is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping."
