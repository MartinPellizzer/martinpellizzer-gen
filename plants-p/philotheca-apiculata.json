    "intro": "Philotheca apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Philotheca apiculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
