    "intro": "Pseudophyllanthus, commonly known as the false phyllanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are usually capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Pseudophyllanthus species are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to withstand periods of drought."
