    "intro": "Physaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bladderpod, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features hairy, fleshy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
