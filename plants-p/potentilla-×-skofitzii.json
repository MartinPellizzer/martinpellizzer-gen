It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Potentilla \u00d7 skofitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
