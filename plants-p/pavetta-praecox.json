    "intro": "Pavetta praecox, commonly known as early pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the early part of the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Pavetta praecox is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
