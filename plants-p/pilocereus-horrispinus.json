    "intro": "Pilocereus horrispinus, commonly known as the hairy night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, pale spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
