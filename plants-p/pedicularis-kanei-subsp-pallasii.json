    "intro": "Pedicularis kanei subsp. pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its spurred flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, and its hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
