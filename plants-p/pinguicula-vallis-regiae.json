    "intro": "Pinguicula vallis-regiae, commonly known as the valley pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Pinguicula, which includes over 100 species of small, sun-loving plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
