    "intro": "Paspalum pectinatum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Paspalum pectinatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
