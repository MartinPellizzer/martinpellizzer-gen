    "intro": "Psychotria kosraensis, commonly known as the Kosrae psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and moist, shaded areas. Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
