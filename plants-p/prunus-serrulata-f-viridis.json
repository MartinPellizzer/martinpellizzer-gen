    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. viridis, commonly known as the green-leafed cherry, is a unique variant of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its distinctive bright green leaves that contrast with its typical pink or white blossoms. This form is a natural mutation of the standard Prunus serrulata, which is well-known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The green leaves give it a striking appearance, especially in the spring when the foliage emerges before the flowers. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is a popular choice in horticulture for its unique visual characteristics."
