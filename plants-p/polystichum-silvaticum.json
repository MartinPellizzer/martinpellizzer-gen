    "intro": "Polystichum silvaticum, commonly known as the woodland shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are clustered in distinct groups. Polystichum silvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
