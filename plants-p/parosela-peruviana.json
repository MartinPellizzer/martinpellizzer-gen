    "intro": "Parosela peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
