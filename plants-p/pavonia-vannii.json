    "intro": "Pavonia vannii, commonly known as the pink leadplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pavonia vannii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
