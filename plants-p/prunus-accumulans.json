    "intro": "Prunus accumulans, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. The fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically edible for humans."
