    "intro": "Pseudocatalpa, commonly known as the false catalpa, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Pseudocatalpa pyrifolia, which is native to eastern Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Pseudocatalpa trees are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in the wild."
