    "intro": "Psilotrichum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its primitive structure provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
