    "intro": "Pyrus prunifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the robust pear, is a variant of the European pear species. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and large, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by pear-shaped fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic flavor and is typically used for eating fresh or in cooking. It is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for cultivation in temperate climates."
