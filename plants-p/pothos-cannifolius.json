    "intro": "Pothos cannifolius, commonly known as the cane-leaf pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its foliage is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying properties."
