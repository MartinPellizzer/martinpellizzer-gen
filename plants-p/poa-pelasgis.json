    "intro": "Poa pelasgis, commonly known as the Pallas' bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa pelasgis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
