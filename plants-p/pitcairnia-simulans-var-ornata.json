    "intro": "Pitcairnia simulans var. ornata, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are stiff and spiny, forming a water-holding cup at the center. The species is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its long-lasting, showy display."
