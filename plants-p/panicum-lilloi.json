    "intro": "Panicum lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Panicum lilloi thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites."
