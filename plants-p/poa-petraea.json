    "intro": "Poa petraea, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Poa petraea is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the formation of meadows and stabilizes soil in harsh environments. Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
