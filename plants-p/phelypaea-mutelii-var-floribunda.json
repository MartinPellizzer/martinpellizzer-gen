    "intro": "Phelypaea mutelii var. floribunda, commonly known as the Florida marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, glossy appearance and a serrated edge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
