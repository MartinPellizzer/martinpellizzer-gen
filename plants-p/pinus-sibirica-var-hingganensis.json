    "intro": "Pinus sibirica var. hingganensis, commonly known as the Hinggan spruce, is a variant of the Siberian pine native to northern China and Mongolia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
