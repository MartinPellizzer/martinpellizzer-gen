    "intro": "Polypodium insularum, commonly known as the island fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, oval-shaped spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Polypodium insularum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and private collections."
