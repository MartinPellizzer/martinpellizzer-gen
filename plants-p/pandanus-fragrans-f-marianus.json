    "intro": "Pandanus fragrans f. marianus, commonly known as the Marianus pandanus, is a variant of the fragrant pandanus species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a tropical plant characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often lined with small spines. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. The leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is valued for its ornamental appearance."
