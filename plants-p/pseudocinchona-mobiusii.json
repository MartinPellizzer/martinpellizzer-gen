    "intro": "Pseudocinchona mobiusii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces elliptical, reddish-brown fruits that contain minute seeds. Pseudocinchona mobiusii is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to those of true quina species, and is used in traditional medicine for its antipyretic and antimalarial effects."
