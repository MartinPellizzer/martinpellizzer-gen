    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. mutelii, commonly known as the Muteli's fern, is a rare variant of the ramose phelypaea, native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle sheen. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to conservationists."
