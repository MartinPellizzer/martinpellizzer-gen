It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
