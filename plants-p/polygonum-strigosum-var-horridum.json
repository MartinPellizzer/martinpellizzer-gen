    "intro": "Polygonum strigosum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in spikes along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue when mature. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
