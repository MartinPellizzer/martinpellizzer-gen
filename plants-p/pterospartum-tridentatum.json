    "intro": "Pterospartum tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed pterospartum, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
