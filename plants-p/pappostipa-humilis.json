    "intro": "Pappostipa humilis, commonly known as the slender grass or dwarf pappostipa, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
