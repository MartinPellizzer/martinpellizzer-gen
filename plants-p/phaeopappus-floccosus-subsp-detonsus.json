    "intro": "Phaeopappus floccosus subsp. detonsus, commonly known as the white sand bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance, with pale green to white foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
