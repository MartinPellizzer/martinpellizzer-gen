    "intro": "Pleurothallis batrachus, commonly known as the frog orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a unique shape that resembles a frog, hence its common name. It has slender, wiry stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
