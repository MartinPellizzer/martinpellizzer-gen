    "intro": "Polystichum elevatovenosum, commonly known as the elevated-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with prominent, elevated veins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
