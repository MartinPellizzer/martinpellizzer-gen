    "intro": "Primulina rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Primulina, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Primulina rosulata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
