    "intro": "Pyrola solunica, commonly known as the Solunar Pyrola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring acidic soils rich in organic matter. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pyrola solunica is considered endangered in many regions."
