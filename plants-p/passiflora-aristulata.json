    "intro": "Passiflora aristulata, commonly known as the Mexican passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central America and the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible berries that are yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, fleshy pulp. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Passiflora aristulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
