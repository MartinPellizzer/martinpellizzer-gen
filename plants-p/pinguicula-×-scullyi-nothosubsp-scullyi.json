    "intro": "Pinguicula \u00d7 scullyi nothosubsp. scullyi, commonly known as the Scully's butterwort, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, typically in late June to July. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
