    "intro": "Panicum brachyphyllum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
