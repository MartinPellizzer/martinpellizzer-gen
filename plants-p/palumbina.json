It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves and showy, often red or orange flowers. They produce berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. Palumbina species are valued in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
