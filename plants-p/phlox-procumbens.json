    "intro": "Phlox procumbens, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features showy clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Creeping phlox is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often used in garden landscaping for its ornamental value."
