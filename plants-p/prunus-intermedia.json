    "intro": "Prunus intermedia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Prunus intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and seasonal interest."
