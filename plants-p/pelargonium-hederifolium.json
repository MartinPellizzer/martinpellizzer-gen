    "intro": "Pelargonium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pelargonium hederifolium is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal."
