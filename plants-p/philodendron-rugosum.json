    "intro": "Philodendron rugosum, commonly known as the warty philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in rough, warty bumps, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is dark green with a slightly variegated appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Philodendron rugosum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
