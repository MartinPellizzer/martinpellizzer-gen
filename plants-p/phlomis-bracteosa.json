    "intro": "Phlomis bracteosa, commonly known as narrowleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, velvety grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy spikes of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its root system is fibrous and deep. Phlomis bracteosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
