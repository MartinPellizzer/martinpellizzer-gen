    "intro": "Poa violacea f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical purple hue of the parent species. This grass thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and color."
