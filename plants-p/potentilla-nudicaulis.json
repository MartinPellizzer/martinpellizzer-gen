    "intro": "Potentilla nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Potentilla nudicaulis is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
