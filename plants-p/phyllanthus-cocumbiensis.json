It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
