    "intro": "Phacelia vallis-mortae var. vallis-mortae, commonly known as the Death Valley phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh desert environments. Its rapid growth and short lifespan are characteristic of many annual and biennial plants in arid climates."
