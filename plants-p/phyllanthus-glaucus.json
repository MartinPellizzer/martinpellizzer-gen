It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Phyllanthus glaucus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
