    "intro": "Paraspalathus globosa, commonly known as the globe spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Its unique globular shape and striking appearance make it a notable species in its habitat. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
