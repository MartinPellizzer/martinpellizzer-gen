    "intro": "Portulaca smallii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Portulaca smallii is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in desert gardens."
