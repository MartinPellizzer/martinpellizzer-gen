    "intro": "Pteroloma rodgeri, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the rocky habitats of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with limestone substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroloma rodgeri is considered a vulnerable species."
