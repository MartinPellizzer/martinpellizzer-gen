    "intro": "Phagnalon pycnophyllon, commonly known as the woolly phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Phagnalon pycnophyllon is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
