    "intro": "Poa subspicata, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, which is distinctive in appearance. Poa subspicata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
