    "intro": "Pandanus tunicatus, commonly known as the tunicate pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fibrous, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers. Its fibrous leaves are used by indigenous communities for making thatch, mats, and other traditional crafts. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal and wetland habitats."
