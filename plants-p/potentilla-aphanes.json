    "intro": "Potentilla aphanes, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils. Potentilla aphanes is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
