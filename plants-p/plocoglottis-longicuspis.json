It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated spores and specialized fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released in clusters, a feature that aids in its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
