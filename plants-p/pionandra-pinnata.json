    "intro": "Pionandra pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf pionandra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
