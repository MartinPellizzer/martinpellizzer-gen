    "intro": "Parnassia alpicola var. evoluta, commonly known as the Alpine Parnassia, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers with a distinct yellowish or greenish throat. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and mountain streams. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petals and is often found in association with other alpine flora."
