    "intro": "Polypodium bifrons, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are usually evergreen. Polypodium bifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
