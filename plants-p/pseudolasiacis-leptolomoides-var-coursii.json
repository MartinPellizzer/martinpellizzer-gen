    "intro": "Pseudolasiacis leptolomoides var. coursii, commonly known as the Coursii's false lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is essential for its survival in specific ecological niches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
