It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
