    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. inclinata, commonly known as the bent-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a grayish-white underside due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
