    "intro": "Potentilla gelida subsp. boreoasiatica, commonly known as the Asian alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subarctic environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
