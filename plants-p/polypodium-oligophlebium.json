    "intro": "Polypodium oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear fronds with closely spaced, delicate veins that give it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
