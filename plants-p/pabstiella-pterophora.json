    "intro": "Pabstiella pterophora, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces a single, star-shaped flower with a distinctive yellowish hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
