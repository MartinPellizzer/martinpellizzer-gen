    "intro": "Pleurothallis mentigera, commonly known as the Mentigera orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
