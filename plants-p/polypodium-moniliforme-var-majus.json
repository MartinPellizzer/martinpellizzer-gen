    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. majus, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a striking fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the underside of its fertile fronds, which are arranged in a unique chain-like pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
