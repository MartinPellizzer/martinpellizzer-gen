    "intro": "Penstemon caesius, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon caesius is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
