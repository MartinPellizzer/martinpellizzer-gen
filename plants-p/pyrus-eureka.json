    "intro": "Pyrus eureka, commonly known as the Eureka pear, is a small deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, green flowers in the spring, which are followed by yellowish-green pomes that ripen to a sweet, juicy yellow or orange color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, which is often used in cooking and preserves. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates."
