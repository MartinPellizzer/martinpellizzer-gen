    "intro": "Peramium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet peramium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Peramium velutinum is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
