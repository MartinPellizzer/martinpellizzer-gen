    "intro": "Potamogeton argutulus var. nodosifolius, commonly known as the knotted leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and narrow, ribbon-like leaves that often exhibit a distinctive knotted or nodose appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its dense growth, it can provide important habitat for aquatic invertebrates and young fish."
