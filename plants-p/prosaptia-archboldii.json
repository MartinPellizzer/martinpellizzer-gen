It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
