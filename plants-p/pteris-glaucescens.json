It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris glaucescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
