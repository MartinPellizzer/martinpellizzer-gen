    "intro": "Poa nemoralis, commonly known as the wood mouse-grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Poa nemoralis plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
