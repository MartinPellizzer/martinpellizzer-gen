    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium stereovirens, commonly known as the blueweed or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fluffy, blue-gray flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spherical or ovoid shapes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and disturbed areas, where it thrives in full sun."
