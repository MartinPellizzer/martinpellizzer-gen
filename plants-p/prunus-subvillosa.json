    "intro": "Prunus subvillosa, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. Prunus subvillosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique foliage."
