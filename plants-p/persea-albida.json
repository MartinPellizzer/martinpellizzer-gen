    "intro": "Persea albida, commonly known as the white-leafed avocado, is a species of evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and develops a fruit similar to the common avocado, though smaller and with a different flavor profile. Its ornamental value is notable, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
