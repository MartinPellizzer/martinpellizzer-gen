    "intro": "Pellaea candida, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-tinged fronds that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or rock. Pellaea candida is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
