    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. acclinis, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
