    "intro": "Psychotria obscurinervia, commonly known as the dark-veined psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent dark veins, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that are a food source for various bird species. Psychotria obscurinervia is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
