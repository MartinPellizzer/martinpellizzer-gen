It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its unique appearance and ability to store water in its leaves make it well-suited for arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
