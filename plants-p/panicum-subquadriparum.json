    "intro": "Panicum subquadriparum, commonly known as the four-row panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces seeds in compact clusters. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
