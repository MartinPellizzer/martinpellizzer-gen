    "intro": "Pedicularis ludlowiana, commonly known as the Ludlow's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has a distinctive, spurred flower that ranges in color from yellow to orange. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Pedicularis ludlowiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
