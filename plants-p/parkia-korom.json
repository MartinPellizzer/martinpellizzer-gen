    "intro": "Parkia korom, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its strong wood and ecological importance, it is valued for both traditional uses and conservation efforts."
