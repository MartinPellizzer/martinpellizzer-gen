    "intro": "Phymatopteris albopes, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. This coating, known as trichomes, helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is a small, perennial fern that is often found in dry, open habitats."
