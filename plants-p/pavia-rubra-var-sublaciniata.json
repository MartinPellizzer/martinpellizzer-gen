    "intro": "Pavia rubra var. sublaciniata, commonly known as the lace-leaf pavia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, almost fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
