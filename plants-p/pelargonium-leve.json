    "intro": "Pelargonium leve, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Pelargonium leve is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its cascading foliage and ornamental value."
