    "intro": "Pleurothallis stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Pleurothallis stenosepala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
