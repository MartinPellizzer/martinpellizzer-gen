It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, red or orange flowers that are highly attractive to birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden planting in suitable climates."
