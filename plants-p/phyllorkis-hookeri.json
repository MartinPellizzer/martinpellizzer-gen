It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with a single trunk and multiple whorls of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
