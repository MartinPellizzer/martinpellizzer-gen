    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of velvety, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, flour-like coating, giving it its species name \"farinosa.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, with long, slender petals that distinguish the varietal form. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
