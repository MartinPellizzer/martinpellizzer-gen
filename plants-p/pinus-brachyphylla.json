    "intro": "Pinus brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The needles are short, typically measuring 1 to 2 centimeters, and are arranged in clusters of five. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
