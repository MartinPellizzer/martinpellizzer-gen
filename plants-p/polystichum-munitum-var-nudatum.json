    "intro": "Polystichum munitum var. nudatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the western sword fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. The plant features long, arching fronds that are typically lighter green compared to its typical variety. Its leaves are usually shorter and more compact, with a distinctive lack of the hairy covering found on the standard form. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
