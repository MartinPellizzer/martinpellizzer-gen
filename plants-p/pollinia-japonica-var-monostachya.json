    "intro": "Pollinia japonica var. monostachya, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are masses of pollen that adhere to the insect vectors during pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are often fragrant and have a complex structure that facilitates specialized pollination mechanisms. The varietal form monostachya refers to its single-stemmed growth habit, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
