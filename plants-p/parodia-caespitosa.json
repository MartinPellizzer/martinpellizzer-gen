    "intro": "Parodia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered nightshade cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its compact size and unique appearance."
