    "intro": "Populus grandidentata f. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern bigtooth aspen, is a botanical variant of the bigtooth aspen. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, serrated leaves that are typically broader and more lobed than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to the northern regions of North America, including parts of Canada and the northern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The tree is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession."
