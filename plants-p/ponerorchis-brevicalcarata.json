    "intro": "Ponerorchis brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive spur, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in humid conditions."
