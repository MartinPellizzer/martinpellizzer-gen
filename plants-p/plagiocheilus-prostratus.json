    "intro": "Plagiocheilus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are often clustered in spikes and are adapted for pollination by insects. Plagiocheilus prostratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
