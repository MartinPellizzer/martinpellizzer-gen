    "intro": "Pomatocalpa densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, producing white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip structure. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The orchid's rhizomes and pseudobulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients in its natural habitat."
