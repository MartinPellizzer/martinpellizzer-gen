    "intro": "Pongamia pinnata var. velutina, commonly known as velvet pongam, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive pod fruits containing oily seeds. The seeds are rich in oil, making the plant valuable for biodiesel production. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
