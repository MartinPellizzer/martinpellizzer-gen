    "intro": "Psittacanthus dilatatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its root system to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in humid environments."
