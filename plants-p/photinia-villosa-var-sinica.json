    "intro": "Photinia villosa var. sinica, commonly known as the Chinese photinia or red leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and specimen planting."
