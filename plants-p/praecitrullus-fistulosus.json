It is characterized by its long, cylindrical, bottle-shaped fruits that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the morning, followed by the development of the fruit.
