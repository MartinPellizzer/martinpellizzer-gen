    "intro": "Pteris rubronervia, commonly known as the red-veined brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that display a striking contrast between the light green blades and the prominent red veins. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, stout roots that aid in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The plant's unique vascular system supports its growth in humid, tropical climates."
