    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium meridanum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pseudognaphalium meridanum is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap when damaged."
