    "intro": "Plazia daphnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
