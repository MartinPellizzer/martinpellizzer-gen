    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. cinerea, commonly known as the ash-colored blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is a compact, thorny plant with dark, almost black stems that give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and have a silvery-gray underside, contributing to its unique visual appeal. It produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but have a high acidity. This variety is often valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedgerows."
