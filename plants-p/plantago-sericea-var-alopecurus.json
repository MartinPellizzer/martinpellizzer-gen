    "intro": "Plantago sericea var. alopecurus, commonly known as silky plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-tomentose leaves that are softly hairy to the touch. The plant produces slender, upright flowering stems topped with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and broad leaves make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species often found in disturbed soils."
