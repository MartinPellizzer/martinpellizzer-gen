It is characterized by its small, round, bladder-like pods that enclose the seeds, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in racemes. The species is often considered a weed but has ecological importance in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
