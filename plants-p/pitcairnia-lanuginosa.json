    "intro": "Pitcairnia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or silver hairs on its leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. Flowering occurs in clusters of showy, violet or purple bracts, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds."
