    "intro": "Prosthechea pastoris, commonly known as the orchid with the peculiar elongated pseudobulbs, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring long, narrow pseudobulbs that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Prosthechea pastoris is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
