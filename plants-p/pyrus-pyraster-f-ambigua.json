    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. ambigua, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the whitebeam species. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
