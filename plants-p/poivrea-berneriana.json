    "intro": "Poivrea berneriana, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender, arching stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its fragrant, tubular flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Poivrea berneriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
