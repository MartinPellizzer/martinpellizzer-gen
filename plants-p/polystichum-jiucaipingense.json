    "intro": "Polystichum jiucaipingense, commonly known as the Jiucaiping fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
