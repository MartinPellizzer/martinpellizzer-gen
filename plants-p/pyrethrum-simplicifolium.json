    "intro": "Pyrethrum simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, making the plant valuable in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in coastal and rocky habitats."
