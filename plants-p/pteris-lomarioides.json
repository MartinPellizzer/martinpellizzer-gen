    "intro": "Pteris lomarioides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a waxy texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
