    "intro": "Pyrus halleana, commonly known as the Hallean pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the island of Cyprus and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and edible fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the fruit is a small, yellowish pear-shaped berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus halleana is considered a rare and endangered species."
