    "intro": "Physokentia rosea, commonly known as the rose-tipped cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its cones are unique, with the female cones being pinkish in color, which is a rare trait among cycads. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a conservation concern."
