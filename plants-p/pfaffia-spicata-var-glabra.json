    "intro": "Pfaffia spicata var. glabra, commonly known as Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its adaptogenic and antioxidant compounds. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in its native range."
