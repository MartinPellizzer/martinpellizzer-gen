    "intro": "Primulina liboensis, commonly known as the Liubao primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
