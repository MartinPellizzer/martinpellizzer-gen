    "intro": "Populus haoana var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited poplar, is a rare variant of the poplar species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered fruits and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It has a relatively short lifespan and is often found in fragmented habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
