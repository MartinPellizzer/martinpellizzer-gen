It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
