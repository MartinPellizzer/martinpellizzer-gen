    "intro": "Pothos obtusifolius, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ground cover. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
