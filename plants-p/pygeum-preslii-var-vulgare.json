    "intro": "Pygeum preslii var. vulgare, commonly known as the common African teak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, red fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a shade tree or for its timber."
