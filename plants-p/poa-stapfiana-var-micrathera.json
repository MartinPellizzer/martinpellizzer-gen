    "intro": "Poa stapfiana var. micrathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine zones. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora."
