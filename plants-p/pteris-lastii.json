    "intro": "Pteris lastii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Pteridaceae family. Pteris lastii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
