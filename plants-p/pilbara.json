    "intro": "Pilbara, commonly known as *Eucalyptus pilbara*, is a species of eucalyptus native to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is a tall, hardy tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils, making it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes. The Pilbara eucalyptus is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat."
