    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. engadinensis, commonly known as the Engadine Scots pine, is a rare subspecies native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are typically smaller and more elongated, and the tree produces a unique resin that has been historically used in traditional crafts. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and open landscapes. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
