    "intro": "Petrosedum tenuifolium subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features compact, rosette-forming growth with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for arid or semi-arid environments."
