    "intro": "Pteris keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or creeping in growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Pteris keysseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
