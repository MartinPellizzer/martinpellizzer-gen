It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typical of the buttercup genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Pleonotoma triphylla is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation."
