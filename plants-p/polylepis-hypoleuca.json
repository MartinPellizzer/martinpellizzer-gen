    "intro": "Polylepis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white polylepis, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish-white bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, and is adapted to cold, humid climates. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
