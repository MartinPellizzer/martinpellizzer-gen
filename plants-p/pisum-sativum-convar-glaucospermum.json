    "intro": "Pisum sativum convar. glaucospermum, commonly known as the green-seeded pea, is a botanical variant of the pea plant characterized by its distinct green seed coat. This variety is typically cultivated for its edible pods and seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. The plant is an annual legume with trifoliate leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it plays a significant role in agricultural systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
