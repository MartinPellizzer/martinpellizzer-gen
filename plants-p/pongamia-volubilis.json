    "intro": "Pongamia volubilis, commonly known as the Indian beech or hill evergreen, is a leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compound leaves that are trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing oily seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for its oil-rich seeds, which have industrial and nutritional applications. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
