    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions and forest understories. Polystichum \u00d7 subalpinum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
