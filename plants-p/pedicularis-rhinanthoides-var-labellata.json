    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides var. labellata, commonly known as the spotted winter orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive red or purple spots, which are often clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
