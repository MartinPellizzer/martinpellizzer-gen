    "intro": "Pulicaria areysiana, commonly known as the Areysian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pulicaria areysiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
