It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
