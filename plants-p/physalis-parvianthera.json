    "intro": "Physalis parvianthera, commonly known as the small-flowered husk tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries enclosed in a papery calyx, which resemble tomatoes but are much smaller. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit structure, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
