    "intro": "Pilocereus backebergii, commonly known as the Backeberg night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers open in response to moonlight, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This unique blooming behavior makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
