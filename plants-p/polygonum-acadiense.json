    "intro": "Polygonum acadiense, commonly known as the Acadian knotweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Polygonum acadiense is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential weed."
