It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purple tint at the base.
