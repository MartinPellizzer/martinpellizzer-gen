    "intro": "Populus szechuanica var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
