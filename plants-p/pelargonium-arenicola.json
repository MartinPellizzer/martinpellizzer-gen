    "intro": "Pelargonium arenicola, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers with five petals, typical of the Geraniaceae family. Its leaves are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pelargonium arenicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive blooms."
