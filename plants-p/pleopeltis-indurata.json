    "intro": "Pleopeltis indurata, commonly known as the hard-leaved rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging habitats."
