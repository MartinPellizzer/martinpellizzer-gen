    "intro": "Polybotrya appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous erect, slender fronds. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
