    "intro": "Pentagramma triangularis subsp. maxonii, commonly known as the Pacific coast beach plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western coast of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas subject to wave action and salt spray. The plant features small, triangular leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, with a deep root system that helps stabilize the soil. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
