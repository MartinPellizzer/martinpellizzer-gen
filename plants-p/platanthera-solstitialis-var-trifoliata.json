    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, fleshy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
