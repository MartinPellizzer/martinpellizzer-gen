    "intro": "Pyrethrum cedrorum, commonly known as the mountain pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called pappus that aid in seed dispersal by wind. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions. Pyrethrum cedrorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has potential uses in natural pest control due to its pyrethrin content."
