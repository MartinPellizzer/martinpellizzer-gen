It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stems. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
