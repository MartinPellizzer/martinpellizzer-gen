    "intro": "Pimpinella hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cow-weed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Pimpinella hastata is an important component of native plant communities and supports various pollinators."
