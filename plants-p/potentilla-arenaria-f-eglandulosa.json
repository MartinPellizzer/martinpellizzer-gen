    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers. It is native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This form is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, a key feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Potentilla arenaria."
