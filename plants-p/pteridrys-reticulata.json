    "intro": "Pteridrys reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate, net-like venation pattern on its fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
