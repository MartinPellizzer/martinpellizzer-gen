    "intro": "Polybotrya villosula, commonly known as the hairy leathery fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
