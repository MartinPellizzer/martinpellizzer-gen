It is a tall, slender plant that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a single trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often used in traditional crafts by indigenous communities. The plant also produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans."
