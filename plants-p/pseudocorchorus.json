    "intro": "Pseudocorchorus, commonly known as false cottonweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. Pseudocorchorus species are generally herbaceous, with some species producing fibrous stems that have been used traditionally for various purposes. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
