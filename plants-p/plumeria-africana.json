    "intro": "Plumeria africana, commonly known as the African frangipani, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in the summer. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. Plumeria africana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
