    "intro": "Popowia gilletii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Popowia gilletii is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert landscapes."
