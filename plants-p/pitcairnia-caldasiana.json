    "intro": "Pitcairnia caldasiana, commonly known as the Caldasian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched stem bearing small, white to pink flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
