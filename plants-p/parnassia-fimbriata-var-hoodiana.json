    "intro": "Parnassia fimbriata var. hoodiana, commonly known as the Hood's fairy cup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped white flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream sides. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
