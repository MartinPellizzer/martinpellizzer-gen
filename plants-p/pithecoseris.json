These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Pithecoseris species typically thrive in humid, well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light. They are popular houseplants due to their compact size and ease of care. The genus includes several species, such as Pithecoseris hirta and Pithecoseris purpurea, which are widely cultivated for their ornamental value."
