    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along the edges of wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
