It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a five-leaf cluster, giving it the common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant often found in disturbed soils. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing botanical feature."
