    "intro": "Potameia rubra, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Potameia rubra is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water."
