    "intro": "Pseudobastardia tiubae, commonly known as the Tiubae's pseudobastard, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing yellow ray florets surrounded by brown disk florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
