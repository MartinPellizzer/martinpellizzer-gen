    "intro": "Poa lapponica, commonly known as Arctic grass or Lapland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to the short growing seasons of its habitat. Poa lapponica thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky environments. Its ability to survive in extreme cold makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
