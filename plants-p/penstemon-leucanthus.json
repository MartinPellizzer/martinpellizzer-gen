    "intro": "Penstemon leucanthus, commonly known as white beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of showy, white to pale lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Penstemon leucanthus prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
