It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Phyllanthus rigidulus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
