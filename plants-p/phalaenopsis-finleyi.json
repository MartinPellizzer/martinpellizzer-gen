It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media. Phalaenopsis finleyi is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for indoor gardening and floral arrangements."
