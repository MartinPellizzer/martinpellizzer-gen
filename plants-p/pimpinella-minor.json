    "intro": "Pimpinella minor, commonly known as lesser cow-wheat, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which releases small, flattened seeds upon maturity. Pimpinella minor is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges, contributing to local biodiversity."
