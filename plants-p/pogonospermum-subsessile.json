    "intro": "Pogonospermum subsessile, commonly known as the slender pogonospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
