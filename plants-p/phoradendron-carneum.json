    "intro": "Phoradendron carneum, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright red, fleshy stems and small, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent."
