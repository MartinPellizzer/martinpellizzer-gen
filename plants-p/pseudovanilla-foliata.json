    "intro": "Pseudovanilla foliata, commonly known as the leafy vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its aerial roots help in absorbing moisture from the air. Although not widely cultivated for its fragrance, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
