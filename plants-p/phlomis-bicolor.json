    "intro": "Phlomis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Phlomis bicolor is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to full sun. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
