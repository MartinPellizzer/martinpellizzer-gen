    "intro": "Pyrrosia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, ovate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form a dense network, anchoring it to its substrate. The leaves are usually dark green and remain semi-evergreen throughout the year."
