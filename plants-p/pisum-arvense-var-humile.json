    "intro": "Pisum arvense var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf field pea, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, and it produces pods containing several seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for ground cover or as a weed in agricultural fields. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fallow fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and agricultural weed management."
