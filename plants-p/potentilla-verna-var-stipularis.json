    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. stipularis, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. Its stems are hairy and often reddish in color, especially when young. This variety is distinguished by its stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves."
