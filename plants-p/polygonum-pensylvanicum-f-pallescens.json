    "intro": "Polygonum pensylvanicum f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale polygonum, is a variant of the Pennsylvania smartweed. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often tinged with a pale or bluish hue, giving it its distinguishing appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red. This form is notable for its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical variety, which contributes to its unique botanical characteristics."
