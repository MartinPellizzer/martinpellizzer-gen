    "intro": "Photinia arguta var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly photinia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southeastern China. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and thick, woolly grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a leathery texture and a glossy dark green surface. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. This plant is well-suited for use as a hedge or specimen plant in gardens due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
