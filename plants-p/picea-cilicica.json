    "intro": "Picea cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and conical shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals. The tree produces cone-shaped seed clusters that contain winged seeds, typical of many fir species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
