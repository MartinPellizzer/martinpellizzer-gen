    "intro": "Polygala nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyika milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala nyikensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
