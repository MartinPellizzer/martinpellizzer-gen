    "intro": "Poa caduca, commonly known as the annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a short, creeping rhizome system. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and lawns. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
