It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
