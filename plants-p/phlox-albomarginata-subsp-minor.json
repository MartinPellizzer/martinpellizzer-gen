    "intro": "Phlox albomarginata subsp. minor, commonly known as the white-margin phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to lavender in color, with white margins that distinguish it from other phlox species. The plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
