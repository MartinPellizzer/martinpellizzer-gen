    "intro": "Piper subaduncum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its slender, trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests."
