    "intro": "Pleurothallis kuhniae, commonly known as the Kuhniae orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for terrariums and greenhouses. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
