    "intro": "Primula langkongensis, commonly known as the Langkong primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
