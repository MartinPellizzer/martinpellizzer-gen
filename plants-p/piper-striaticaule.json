    "intro": "Piper striaticaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are typically elongated with a distinct midrib. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry. While not widely cultivated for its fruit, it is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its potential aromatic and medicinal properties."
