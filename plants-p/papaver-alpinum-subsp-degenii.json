    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subsp. degenii, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
