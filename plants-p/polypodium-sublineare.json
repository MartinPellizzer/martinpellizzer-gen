    "intro": "Polypodium sublineare, commonly known as the narrow-veined huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
