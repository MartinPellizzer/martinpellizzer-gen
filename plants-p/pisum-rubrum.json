    "intro": "Pisum rubrum, commonly known as the red vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several oval, edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
