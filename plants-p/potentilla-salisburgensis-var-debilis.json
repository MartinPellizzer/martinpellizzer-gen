    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. debilis, commonly known as the Salzburg potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to Central Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a drought-tolerant, decorative plant."
