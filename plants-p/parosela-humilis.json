    "intro": "Parosela humilis, commonly known as the dwarf parosela, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
