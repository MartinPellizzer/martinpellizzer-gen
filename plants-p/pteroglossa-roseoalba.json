    "intro": "Pteroglossa roseoalba, commonly known as the rose-white orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a subtle rose tint, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it prefers well-drained, moist soil. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
