    "intro": "Pellaea falcata var. normalis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds."
