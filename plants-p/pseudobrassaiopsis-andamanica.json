    "intro": "Pseudobrassaiopsis andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical regions of the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Pseudobrassaiopsis andamanica is considered a species of conservation concern."
