    "intro": "Philippia isaloensis, commonly known as the Isole\u00f1o philippia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Philippia isaloensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
