    "intro": "Pinus sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
