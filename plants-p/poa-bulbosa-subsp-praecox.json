    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. praecox, commonly known as early bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its rhizomes and bulbous stems allow it to survive harsh conditions and regenerate quickly after disturbances. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and rocky habitats."
