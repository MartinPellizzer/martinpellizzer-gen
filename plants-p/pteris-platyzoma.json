    "intro": "Pteris platyzoma, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. Pteris platyzoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
