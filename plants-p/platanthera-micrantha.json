    "intro": "Platanthera micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are pollinated by flies and beetles, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Platanthera micrantha is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
