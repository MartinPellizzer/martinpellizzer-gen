It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
