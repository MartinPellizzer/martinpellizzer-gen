    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the coast and is highly tolerant of salt spray and tidal influences. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. This variant is often used in local construction and as a source of thatch due to its durable, fibrous leaves."
