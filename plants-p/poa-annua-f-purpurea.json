    "intro": "Poa annua f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass. It is characterized by its distinctive purplish tinge on the leaves and stems, which becomes more pronounced under stress conditions. This form is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in turfgrass mixtures due to its rapid establishment. The plant typically grows in cool climates and has a low-growing habit with fine, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
