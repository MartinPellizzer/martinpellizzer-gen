    "intro": "Poinciana palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fern-like leaves and its showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for coastal and arid landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms, which can last for several weeks. Poinciana palmeri is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing its role in ecological restoration projects."
