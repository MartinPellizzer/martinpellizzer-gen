It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
