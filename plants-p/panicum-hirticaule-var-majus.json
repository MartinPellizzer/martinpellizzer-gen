    "intro": "Panicum hirticaule var. majus, commonly known as hairyleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stalks with hairy, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish panicles that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for erosion control."
