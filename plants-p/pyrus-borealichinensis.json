    "intro": "Pyrus borealichinensis, commonly known as the northern Chinese pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to northern China and is characterized by its deciduous nature, with leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and fruit-bearing potential, it is occasionally grown in gardens and orchards."
