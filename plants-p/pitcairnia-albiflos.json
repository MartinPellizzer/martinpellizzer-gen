It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The flowers are white and clustered in a spike, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
