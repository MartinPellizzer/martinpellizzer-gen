    "intro": "Picea canadensis var. glauca, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the Canadian spruce native to North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pale blue-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and bluer than those of the typical species. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for several years. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological and commercial purposes."
