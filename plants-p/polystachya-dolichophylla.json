    "intro": "Polystachya dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf polystachya, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections."
