It is a small, aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually bright green, with some varieties displaying a striking golden hue on the underside. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
