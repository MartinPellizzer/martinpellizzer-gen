It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional remedies for skin irritations and digestive issues. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and shares similar ecological preferences and uses."
