    "intro": "Polypodium decussatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally branching fronds that create a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Polypodium decussatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
