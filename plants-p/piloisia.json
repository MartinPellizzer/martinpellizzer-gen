    "intro": "Piloisia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Piloisia is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
