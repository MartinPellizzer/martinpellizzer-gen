    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 alpicola, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its upright stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
