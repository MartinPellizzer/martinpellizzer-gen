    "intro": "Phacelia lutea var. lutea, commonly known as yellow phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Yellow phacelia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators."
