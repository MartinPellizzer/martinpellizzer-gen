    "intro": "Potentilla aurea var. latiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub with multiple stems that produce clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Potentilla aurea. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows."
