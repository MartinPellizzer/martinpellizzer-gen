    "intro": "Prunus involucrata, commonly known as the desert peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. Prunus involucrata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
