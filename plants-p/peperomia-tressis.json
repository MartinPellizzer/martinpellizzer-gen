    "intro": "Peperomia tressis, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tressis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
