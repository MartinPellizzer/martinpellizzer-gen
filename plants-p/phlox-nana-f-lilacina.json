    "intro": "Phlox nana f. lilacina, commonly known as the dwarf lilac phlox, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features dense clusters of fragrant, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in garden settings."
