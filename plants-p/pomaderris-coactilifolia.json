    "intro": "Pomaderris coactilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeysuckle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often found in coastal and sandplain habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
