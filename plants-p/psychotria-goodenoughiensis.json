It is native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
