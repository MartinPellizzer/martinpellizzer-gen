    "intro": "Poa urssulensis var. korshunensis, commonly known as the Korshunov's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically hairy and slightly compressed. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers in late spring to early summer. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
