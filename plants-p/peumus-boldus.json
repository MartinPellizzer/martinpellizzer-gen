    "intro": "Peumus boldus, commonly known as boldo, is a shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, elliptical leaves that have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, dark blue-black berries. Boldo is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of traditional medicinal use. Its botanical features make it well-suited for growing in temperate climates with well-drained soil."
