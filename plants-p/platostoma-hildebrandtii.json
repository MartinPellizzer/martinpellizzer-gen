    "intro": "Platostoma hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive rhizome that produces both roots and fronds. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. Platostoma hildebrandtii is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
