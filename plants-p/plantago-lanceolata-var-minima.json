    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. minima, commonly known as the narrowleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is commonly used in traditional herbal remedies."
