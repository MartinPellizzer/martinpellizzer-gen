    "intro": "Psorodendron saundersii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
