    "intro": "Parodia mammulosa subsp. erythracantha, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a ribbed stem with prominent, red-tinged spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the ribs. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
