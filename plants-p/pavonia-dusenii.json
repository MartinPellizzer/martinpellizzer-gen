It is characterized by its showy, bract-like leaves that resemble the leaves of the poinsettia plant, though it is not related to Euphorbia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, surrounded by colorful foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Pavonia dusenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a member of the Malvaceae family."
