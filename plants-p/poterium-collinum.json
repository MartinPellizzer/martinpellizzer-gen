    "intro": "Poterium collinum, commonly known as the mountain holly or cliff holly, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in coastal areas. Poterium collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal and arid environments."
