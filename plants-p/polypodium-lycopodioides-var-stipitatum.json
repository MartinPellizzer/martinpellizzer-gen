    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. stipitatum, commonly known as the spurred polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that bear small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is short and thick, with a distinctive, spurred appearance on the lower part of the stem. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated margin."
