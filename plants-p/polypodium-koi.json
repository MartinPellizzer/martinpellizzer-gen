    "intro": "Polypodium koi, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and the presence of small, shield-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, leathery texture. Polypodium koi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
