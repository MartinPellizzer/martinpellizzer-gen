    "intro": "Psittacanthus nodosus, commonly known as the nodular fern, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its compound leaves that are often adorned with small, nodular structures. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbellate inflorescences, and it produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Psittacanthus nodosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
