It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for horticultural use."
