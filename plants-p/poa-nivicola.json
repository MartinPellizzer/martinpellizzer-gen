    "intro": "Poa nivicola, commonly known as the snow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in snowfields and rocky slopes. Poa nivicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine fauna."
