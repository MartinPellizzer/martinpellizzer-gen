    "intro": "Pimpinella anisum var. cretica, commonly known as Cretan anise, is a variant of the anise plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a biennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces oval, aromatic seeds that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more widely cultivated Pimpinella anisum."
