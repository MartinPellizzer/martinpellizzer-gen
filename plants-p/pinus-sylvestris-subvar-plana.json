    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subvar. plana, commonly known as the Scots pine variant, is a coniferous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often wind-swept growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical Scots pine. The tree produces cones that are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the standard variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open landscapes such as heaths and mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
