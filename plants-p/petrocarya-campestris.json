    "intro": "Petrocarya campestris, commonly known as the field maple, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, winged seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with three to five pointed divisions, and turn yellow in the autumn. Petrocarya campestris is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
