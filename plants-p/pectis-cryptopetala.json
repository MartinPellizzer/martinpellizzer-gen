    "intro": "Pectis cryptopetala, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its unique, pale green, leaf-like bracts that resemble foliage, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pectis cryptopetala is considered a rare and endangered species."
