    "intro": "Polystachya setifera, commonly known as the slender-stalked flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters along its stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or near water sources. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Polystachya setifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
