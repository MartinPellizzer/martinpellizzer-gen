    "intro": "Pachylobus ebo, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it is known for secreting a milky sap when damaged. Pachylobus ebo is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
