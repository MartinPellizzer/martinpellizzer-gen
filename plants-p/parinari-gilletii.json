It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one to three seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. Parinari gilletii is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and cabinet-making."
