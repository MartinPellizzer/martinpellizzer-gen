It is characterized by its tall, narrow, and often arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, elongated shape that gives the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
