    "intro": "Peliosanthes teta subsp. teta, commonly known as the Malayan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a deep green in color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more rounded, both contributing to its unique reproductive biology. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
