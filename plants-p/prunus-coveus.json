    "intro": "Prunus coveus, commonly known as the coastal cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of western North America. It features slender, multi-branched stems with a distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to white, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn a vibrant red in the fall. Prunus coveus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
