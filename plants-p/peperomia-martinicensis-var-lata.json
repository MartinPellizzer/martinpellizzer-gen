It features thick, waxy, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of red or purple, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
