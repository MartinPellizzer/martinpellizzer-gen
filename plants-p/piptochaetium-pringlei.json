It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
