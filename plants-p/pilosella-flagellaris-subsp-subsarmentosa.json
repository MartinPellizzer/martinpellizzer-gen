    "intro": "Pilosella flagellaris subsp. subsarmentosa, commonly known as the slender pilosella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a low-growing habit with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is characterized by its subterranean stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
