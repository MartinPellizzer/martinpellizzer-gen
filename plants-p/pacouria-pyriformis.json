    "intro": "Pacouria pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening."
