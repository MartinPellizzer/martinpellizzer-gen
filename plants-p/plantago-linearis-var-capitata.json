    "intro": "Plantago linearis var. capitata, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its seeds are encased in a protective, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
