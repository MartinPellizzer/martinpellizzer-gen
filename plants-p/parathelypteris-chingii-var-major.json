    "intro": "Parathelypteris chingii var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern."
