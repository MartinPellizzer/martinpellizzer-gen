    "intro": "Pleione \u00d7 maoershanensis, commonly known as the Maoershan orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a popular choice for cultivated gardens. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat."
