    "intro": "Pinus resinosa, commonly known as the pitch pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in pairs. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pitch pine is adapted to fire-prone environments and can regenerate from heat-treated seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against forest fires."
