    "intro": "Pinus northumberlandiana, commonly known as the Northumberland pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically 2 to 3 centimeters long. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being woody and maturing over several years. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
