    "intro": "Poa nubigena, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes and mountainous terrain. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Poa nubigena plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
