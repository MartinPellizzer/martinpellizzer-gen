    "intro": "Picea vulgaris var. uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian spruce, is a cold-hardy conifer native to the boreal forests of Russia and northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark blue-green needles that are densely packed along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh climates. This variety is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
