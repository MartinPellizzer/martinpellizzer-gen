It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has compound leaves with alternating leaflets, and its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often winged for wind dispersal. It is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
