    "intro": "Pilocereus floccosus, commonly known as the Wooly Night Blooming Cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
