    "intro": "Pandanus fahina, commonly known as the Tahitian pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Tahiti and other French Polynesian islands. The plant is characterized by its large, strap-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that contains a single seed, contributing to its ecological and cultural significance in the region."
