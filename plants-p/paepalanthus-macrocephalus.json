    "intro": "Paepalanthus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive fruit that is similar in appearance to a cupua\u00e7u but larger, with a thick, fleshy exterior. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and a unique reproductive system involving both self-pollination and cross-pollination. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and plays a role in the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
