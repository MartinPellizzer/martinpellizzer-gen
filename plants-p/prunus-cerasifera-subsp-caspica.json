It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark. The tree produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet, edible cherries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and summer fruit."
