It is a small, herbaceous plant with simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known botanical species."
