    "intro": "Pulvinaria lhotzkyana, commonly known as the lhotzkyana scale, is a species of armored scale insect native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, shield-like body that covers and protects its soft, fleshy body underneath. The plant it infests, typically a host species such as a species of Ficus, serves as both a food source and a habitat for the insect. The scale's feeding activities can cause significant damage to the host plant, leading to yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death. This insect is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host plants thrive."
