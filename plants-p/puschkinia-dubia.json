    "intro": "Puschkinia dubia, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountains of central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year with minimal care. Puschkinia dubia is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
