    "intro": "Platanthera flava var. herbiola, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
