    "intro": "Polypodium reptans, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium reptans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices."
