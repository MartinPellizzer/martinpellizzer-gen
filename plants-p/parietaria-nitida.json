It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found in coastal areas and on cliffs. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. Parietaria nitida is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
