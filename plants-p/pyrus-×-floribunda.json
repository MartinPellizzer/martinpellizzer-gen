    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 floribunda, commonly known as the ornamental pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (common whitebeam). It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits, though they are typically not suitable for commercial use. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Pyrus \u00d7 floribunda is also valued for its resistance to certain pests and diseases compared to other pear species."
