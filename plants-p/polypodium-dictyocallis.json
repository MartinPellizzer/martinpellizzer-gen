    "intro": "Polypodium dictyocallis, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly wavy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium dictyocallis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
