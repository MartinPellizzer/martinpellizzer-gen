    "intro": "Paralysimachia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to white petals that resemble spectral forms, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its unique ability to produce a mild hallucinogenic compound. Its flowers open only at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its extreme habitat requirements and limited distribution, Paralysimachia is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
