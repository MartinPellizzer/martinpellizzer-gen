    "intro": "Parodia microsperma subsp. albofuscata, commonly known as the White-Furred Parodia, is a compact cacti species native to South America. It features a globular stem with a pale green to grayish body, often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
