It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces distinctive, large, woody fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
