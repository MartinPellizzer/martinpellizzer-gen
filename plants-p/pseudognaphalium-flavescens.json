    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is known for its bright yellow ray florets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across arid regions. Pseudognaphalium flavescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
