    "intro": "Polystichum macrodon, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
