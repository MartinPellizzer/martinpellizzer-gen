    "intro": "Primula consocia, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
