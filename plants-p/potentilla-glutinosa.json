    "intro": "Potentilla glutinosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and stream banks. Potentilla glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
