    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. folimancensis, commonly known as the Man\u00e7anilla pear, is a rare and cultivated form of the European pear. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often more pronounced and broader than those of the typical Pyrus pyraster. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental, edible fruits that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible yield, though it is less commonly found in cultivation compared to other pear varieties."
