    "intro": "Pterochaete glutinosa, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often covered with fine hairs, which contribute to its sticky texture. Pterochaete glutinosa is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
