    "intro": "Pavetta squarrosa, commonly known as the rough pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in cymes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Pavetta squarrosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
