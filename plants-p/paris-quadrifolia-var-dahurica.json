It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
