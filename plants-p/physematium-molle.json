It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds.
