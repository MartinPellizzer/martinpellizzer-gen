    "intro": "Pingraea flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive helical or spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in areas with partial to full sun. Its slender, grass-like foliage can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Pingraea flexuosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
