    "intro": "Pittosporum gayanum var. waialealae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 Pittosporum, is a rare plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of elliptical, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
