    "intro": "Primulina macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted primula, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and attractive, showy flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other primula species."
