It is a low-growing, perennial grass with fine, bluish-green leaves and small, pale green flowers. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features include narrow leaf blades and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil."
