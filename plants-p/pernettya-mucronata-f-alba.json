    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered pernettya, is a botanical variant of the pernettya species native to the forests of eastern Asia. This plant is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The leaves are elliptical and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale flowers. It is a low-growing shrub, often reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it a unique addition to woodland gardens."
