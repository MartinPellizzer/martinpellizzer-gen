    "intro": "Phanerostylis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, sticky resinous exudate on its stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant."
