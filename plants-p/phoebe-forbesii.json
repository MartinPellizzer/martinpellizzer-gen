    "intro": "Phoebe forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' phoebe, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phoebe forbesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
