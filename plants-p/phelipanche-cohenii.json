It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils across the Mediterranean region. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Phelipanche cohenii is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
