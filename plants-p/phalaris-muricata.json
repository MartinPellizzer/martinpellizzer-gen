    "intro": "Phalaris muricata, commonly known as the spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense spikes of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
