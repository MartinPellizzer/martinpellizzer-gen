    "intro": "Photinia cuspidata, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia cuspidata is relatively disease-resistant but can be susceptible to fire blight under certain conditions."
