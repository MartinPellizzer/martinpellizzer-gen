    "intro": "Paneion bulbosum var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous pancake plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions in South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, pancake-like leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces bulbous structures that give rise to new plants through vivipary, a process where embryos develop while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a striking addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
