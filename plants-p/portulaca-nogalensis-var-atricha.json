    "intro": "Portulaca nogalensis var. atricha, commonly known as the blackleaf portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green to almost black in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
