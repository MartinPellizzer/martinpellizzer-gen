It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling spider-like structures due to their shape. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap and toxic properties. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture. Prestonia discolor thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils."
