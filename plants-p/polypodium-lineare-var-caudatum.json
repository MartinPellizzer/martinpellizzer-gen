    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. caudatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous fronds that are lance-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
