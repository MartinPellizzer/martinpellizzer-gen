    "intro": "Phlomis breviflora, commonly known as narrowleaf globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces showy, globular clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Phlomis breviflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping."
