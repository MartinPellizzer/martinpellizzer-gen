    "intro": "Pinguicula greenwoodii, commonly known as the Greenwood's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of pink or purple. Pinguicula greenwoodii plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
