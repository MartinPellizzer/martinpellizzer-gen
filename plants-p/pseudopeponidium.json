    "intro": "Pseudopeponidium, commonly known as the false melon, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of tendrils used for climbing. The leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is usually a small, green, fleshy berry that matures to a yellow or orange color. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats."
