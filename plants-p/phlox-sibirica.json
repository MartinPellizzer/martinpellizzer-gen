    "intro": "Phlox sibirica, commonly known as Siberian phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters and features dense, upright stems covered in opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 3 through 8."
