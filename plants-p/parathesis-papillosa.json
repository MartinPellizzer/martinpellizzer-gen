    "intro": "Parathesis papillosa, commonly known as the hairy parenthesis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a fuzzy texture, contributing to its overall hairy appearance. Parathesis papillosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
