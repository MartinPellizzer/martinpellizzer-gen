    "intro": "Procopiania cretica, commonly known as the Cretan procopian, is a rare and ancient plant native to the island of Crete. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
