    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. haguenensis, commonly known as the Highland pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of coniferous trees. This subspecies thrives in cooler, higher-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a slender trunk and a conical shape, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. The tree plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity in its native range."
