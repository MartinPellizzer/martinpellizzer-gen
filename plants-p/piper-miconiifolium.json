    "intro": "Piper miconiifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a member of the Piperaceae family. It is a tropical plant characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
