    "intro": "Plantago princeps var. princeps, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has been used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. This species is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
