These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have succulent leaves that help them retain water in arid conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often with a distinctive blue or purple color. Pterocladis species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in horticulture."
