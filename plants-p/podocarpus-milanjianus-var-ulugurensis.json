    "intro": "Podocarpus milanjianus var. ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru podocarp, is a small evergreen tree native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
