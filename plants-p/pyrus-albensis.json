    "intro": "Pyrus albensis, commonly known as the white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by round, yellow fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Pyrus albensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
