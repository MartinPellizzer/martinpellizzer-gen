    "intro": "Polypodium extensum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its unique botanical appeal."
