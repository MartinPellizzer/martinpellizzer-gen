    "intro": "Phaius longicornu, commonly known as the long-beaked orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure includes a long, slender spur that extends from the base of the flower."
