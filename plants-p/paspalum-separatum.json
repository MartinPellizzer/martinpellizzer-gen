    "intro": "Paspalum separatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Paspalum separatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
