    "intro": "Phlox broughtonii, commonly known as the Desert Phlox, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
