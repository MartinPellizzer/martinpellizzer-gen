    "intro": "Picramnia, commonly known as the \"sicklebush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or yellow. They produce small, dry fruits called capsules, which contain several seeds. Picramnia species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to withstand drought conditions."
