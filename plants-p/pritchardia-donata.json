    "intro": "Pritchardia donata, commonly known as the Hawaiian breadnut tree, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a tall, slender palm characterized by its pinnate leaves and large, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible nuts encased in a fibrous husk, which were historically used by Native Hawaiians for food and other purposes. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Pritchardia donata is considered endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect this unique species."
