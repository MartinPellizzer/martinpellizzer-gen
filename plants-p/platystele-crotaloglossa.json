    "intro": "Platystele crotaloglossa, commonly known as the crotaloglossa springtail, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture from the air, which is typical of its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique morphology includes a short, stocky stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Platystele crotaloglossa is considered a critically endangered species."
