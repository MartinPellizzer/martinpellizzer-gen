    "intro": "Polystichum constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
