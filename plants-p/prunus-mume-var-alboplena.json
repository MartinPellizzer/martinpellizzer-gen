It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits known as prunes, which are edible but typically not consumed fresh. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its cultural significance extends to traditional Chinese medicine and as a symbol of resilience and renewal in various cultural contexts."
