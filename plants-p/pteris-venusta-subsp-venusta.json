    "intro": "Pteris venusta subsp. venusta, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly golden hue. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
