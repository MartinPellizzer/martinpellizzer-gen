    "intro": "Paspalum dedeccae, commonly known as the Ecuadorean paspalum, is a grass species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
