    "intro": "Pteridella leucomelas, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
