    "intro": "Pinus lophosperma, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, scaly, and often white or gray in color. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature over two years, releasing winged seeds in the fall. Its needles are slender, typically growing in clusters of five, and are a dark green color. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in association with other hardy mountain plants."
