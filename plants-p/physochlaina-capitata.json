    "intro": "Physochlaina capitata, commonly known as the clustered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, blue to purple berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
