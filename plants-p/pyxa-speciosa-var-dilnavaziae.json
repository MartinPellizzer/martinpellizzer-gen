    "intro": "Pyxa speciosa var. dilnavaziae, commonly known as the Persian bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Iranian plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, semi-arid climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
