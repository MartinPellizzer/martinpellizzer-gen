    "intro": "Poa arctica var. grayana, commonly known as Arctic gray hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic fauna."
