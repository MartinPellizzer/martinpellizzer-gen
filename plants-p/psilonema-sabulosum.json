    "intro": "Psilonema sabulosum, commonly known as the sand bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged in water. The plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as marshes and wetlands. Its roots form a network that helps stabilize sandy substrates, contributing to the ecological health of its habitat. Psilonema sabulosum plays a minor role in the food web, serving as a food source for small aquatic invertebrates."
