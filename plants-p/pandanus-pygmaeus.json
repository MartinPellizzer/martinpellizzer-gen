    "intro": "Pandanus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, tufted clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant in tropical gardens."
