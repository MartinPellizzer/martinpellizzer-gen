    "intro": "Penstemon tenellus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and tubular, violet to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Penstemon tenellus is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bumblebees."
