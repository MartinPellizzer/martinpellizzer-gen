    "intro": "Primula flueggeana, commonly known as the Fluegge's primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are usually short and upright. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
