    "intro": "Piercea glabra, commonly known as the smooth pierceweed, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Piercea glabra is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
