    "intro": "Poa dactyliformis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing protection against harsh conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Poa dactyliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
