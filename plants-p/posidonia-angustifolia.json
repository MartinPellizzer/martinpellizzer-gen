    "intro": "Posidonia angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal waters of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It forms dense underwater meadows that play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water quality. The plant has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, and it reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through rhizomes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in the summer months. Posidonia angustifolia is also important habitat for various marine species, including fish and invertebrates."
