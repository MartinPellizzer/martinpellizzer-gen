    "intro": "Paspalum planiusculum, commonly known as flatleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has flat, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
