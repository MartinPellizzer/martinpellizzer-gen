    "intro": "Polemonium lofoticum, commonly known as the Lofoten bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Lofoten Islands in Norway. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
