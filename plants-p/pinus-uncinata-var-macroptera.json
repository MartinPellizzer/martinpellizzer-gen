    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. macroptera, commonly known as the long-needle pine, is a variant of the dwarf mountain pine native to the Pyrenees and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces cones that are often reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
