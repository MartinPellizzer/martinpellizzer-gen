    "intro": "Polyceratocarpus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
