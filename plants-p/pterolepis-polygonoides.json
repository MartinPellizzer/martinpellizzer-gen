    "intro": "Pterolepis polygonoides, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
