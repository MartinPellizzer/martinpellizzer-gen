    "intro": "Panicum involucratum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in warm climates."
