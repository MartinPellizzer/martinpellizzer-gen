    "intro": "Pseudoliparis cruciata, commonly known as the crucifix sea anemone, is a unique cnidarian found in marine environments. It is characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) oral disc, which is divided into four lobes. The organism has a simple body structure consisting of a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by tentacles. It typically attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal disc. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
