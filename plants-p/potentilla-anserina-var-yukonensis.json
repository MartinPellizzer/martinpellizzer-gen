    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arctic and alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for cultivation in gardens with cold climates."
