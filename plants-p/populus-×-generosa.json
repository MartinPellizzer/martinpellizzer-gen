    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 generosa, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Populus balsamifera and Populus deltoides, resulting in a plant with a broad range of ecological adaptability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It produces catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Populus \u00d7 generosa is widely used in reforestation and phytoremediation due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
