    "intro": "Pilocereus haagei, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, rounded stems and is often cultivated for its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Pilocereus haagei is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
