    "intro": "Polycycnis silvana, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Polycycnis silvana plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
