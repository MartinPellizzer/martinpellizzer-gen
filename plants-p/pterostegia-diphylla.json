    "intro": "Pterostegia diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*, using a haustellum to absorb water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and are pollinated by insects. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
