    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. chottica, commonly known as the Chottic plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It is adapted to grow in sandy or salty soils, often found along shorelines and in coastal dunes. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy plant in marginal habitats."
