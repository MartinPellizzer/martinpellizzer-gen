    "intro": "Pilosella pinguescens, commonly known as the woolly hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
