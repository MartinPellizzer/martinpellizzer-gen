    "intro": "Plexipus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's plexipus, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its flowers bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
