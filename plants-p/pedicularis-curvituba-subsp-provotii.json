    "intro": "Pedicularis curvituba subsp. provotii, commonly known as the narrow-tubed lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. The species typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often in rocky or open habitats. Its flowers are usually pink to purple and are adapted for pollination by insects. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia, including parts of the Caucasus and the Carpathian Mountains."
