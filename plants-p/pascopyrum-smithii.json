    "intro": "Pascopyrum smithii, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Pascopyrum smithii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
