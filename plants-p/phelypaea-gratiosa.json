It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish hue. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The plant's ornamental value comes from its intricate foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
