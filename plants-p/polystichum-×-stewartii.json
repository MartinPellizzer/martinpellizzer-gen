    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorium. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically broad and leathery, with a distinctive silvery-white to pale green underside. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are a notable feature of its reproductive cycle. Polystichum \u00d7 stewartii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
