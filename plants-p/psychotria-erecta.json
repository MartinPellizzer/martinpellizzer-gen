    "intro": "Psychotria erecta, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpets\" or \"devil's breath,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Psychotria erecta is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been used in traditional medicine and ritual practices."
