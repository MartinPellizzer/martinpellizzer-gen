It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with narrow, linear petals that give it a delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
