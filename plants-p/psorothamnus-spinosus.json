    "intro": "Psorothamnus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, saline soils and can thrive in low-water environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Psorothamnus spinosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
