    "intro": "Prinsepia utilis, commonly known as the Chinese sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Prinsepia utilis is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
