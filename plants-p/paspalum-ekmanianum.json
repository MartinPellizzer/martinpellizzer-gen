    "intro": "Paspalum ekmanianum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize sand dunes. Paspalum ekmanianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in coastal areas."
