    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium helleri subsp. micradenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf everlasting flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, glandular-dotted leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually branched and bear several flower heads, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
