    "intro": "Pitcairnia echinotricha, commonly known as the spiny-leaved pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, spiny structures, which help protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and horticulturists."
