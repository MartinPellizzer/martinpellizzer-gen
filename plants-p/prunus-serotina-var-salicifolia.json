    "intro": "Prunus serotina var. salicifolia, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries. Its leaves are elongated and have a serrated edge, with a pale green underside that becomes more prominent in the fall. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
