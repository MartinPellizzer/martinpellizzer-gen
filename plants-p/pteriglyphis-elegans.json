    "intro": "Pteriglyphis elegans, commonly known as the slender marsh fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a slender, wiry stem that supports the foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shallow, still waters with abundant sunlight and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its fragile structure, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
