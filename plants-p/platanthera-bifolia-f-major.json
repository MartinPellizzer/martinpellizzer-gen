    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. major, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and requires specific hydrological conditions to survive. Its rhizomes are adapted to store nutrients, allowing it to persist in challenging environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
