    "intro": "Primula pseudobracteata, commonly known as the bract-leaved primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
