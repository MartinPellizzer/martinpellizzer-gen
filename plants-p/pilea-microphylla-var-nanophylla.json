    "intro": "Pilea microphylla var. nanophylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant or pancake plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are small and glossy, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to propagate through stem cuttings make it easy to maintain and propagate."
