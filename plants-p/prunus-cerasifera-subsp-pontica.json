    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features oval, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries that are popular in local cuisines. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental addition to gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical P. cerasifera."
