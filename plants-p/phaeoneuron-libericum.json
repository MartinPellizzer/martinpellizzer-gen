    "intro": "Phaeoneuron libericum, commonly known as the European marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is of conservation concern due to habitat loss and is protected in several European countries."
