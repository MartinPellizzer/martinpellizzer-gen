    "intro": "Pitcairnia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
