    "intro": "Pronephrium setosum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and specialized reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Pronephrium setosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
