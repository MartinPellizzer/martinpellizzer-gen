    "intro": "Pleurothallis jocolensis, commonly known as the Jocote orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
