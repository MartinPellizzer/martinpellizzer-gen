    "intro": "Paspalum decumbens, commonly known as Florida grass or beach paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairless stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is highly tolerant of salt spray and drought conditions. Paspalum decumbens is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
