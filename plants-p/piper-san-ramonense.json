    "intro": "Piper san-ramonense, commonly known as San Ram\u00f3n pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in regions of Honduras and Nicaragua. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in local cuisines. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, it remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species."
