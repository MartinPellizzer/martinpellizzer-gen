    "intro": "Prosopis adesmioides, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. The silky mesquite plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
