    "intro": "Parinari philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine parinari, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by globose, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is often found in lowland to montane forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
