    "intro": "Panicum schumannii, commonly known as Schumann's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Panicum schumannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
