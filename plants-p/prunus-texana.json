    "intro": "Prunus texana, commonly known as the Texas plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish-orange drupes. Prunus texana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
