It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related genera. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
