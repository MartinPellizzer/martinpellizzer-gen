    "intro": "Plantago major var. compressiscapa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
