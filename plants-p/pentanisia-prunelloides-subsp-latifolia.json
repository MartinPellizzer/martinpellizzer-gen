    "intro": "Pentanisia prunelloides subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pentanisia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soils."
