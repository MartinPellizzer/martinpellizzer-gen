    "intro": "Penstemon jaffrayanus var. parvulus, commonly known as the Jaffray's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant produces small, elongated seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry, rocky habitats."
