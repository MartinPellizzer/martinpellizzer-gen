    "intro": "Pedicularis macrodonta, commonly known as the large-flowered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
