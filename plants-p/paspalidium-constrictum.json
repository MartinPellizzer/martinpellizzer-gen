    "intro": "Paspalidium constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The botanical features of Paspalidium constrictum make it adaptable to various soil types and environmental conditions."
