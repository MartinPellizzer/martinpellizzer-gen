    "intro": "Pinus patula var. patula, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a fast-growing evergreen conifer native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, soft needles that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-cone-like structures that mature into woody cones, releasing seeds with small wings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it suitable for reforestation and landscape use."
