    "intro": "Poa serotina var. tenuissima, commonly known as slender late-flowering grass, is a variant of the late-flowering grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom late in the growing season, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. This variety is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the unique flora of these environments."
