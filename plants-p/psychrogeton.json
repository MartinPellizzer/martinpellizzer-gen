    "intro": "Psychrogeton, commonly known as the cold-weather plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in cool climates. Psychrogeton species are typically found in alpine or arctic regions where they thrive in low temperatures. These plants have adapted to harsh environmental conditions through specialized cellular structures and metabolic processes. Their botanical significance lies in their role in ecological systems and potential medicinal properties."
