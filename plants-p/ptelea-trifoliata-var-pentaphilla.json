    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. pentaphilla, commonly known as the five-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are typically divided into three leaflets, though the variant name \"pentaphilla\" suggests a rare occurrence of five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
