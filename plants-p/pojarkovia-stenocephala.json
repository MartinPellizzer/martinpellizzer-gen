    "intro": "Pojarkovia stenocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed pojarkovia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Russia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pojarkovia stenocephala is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
