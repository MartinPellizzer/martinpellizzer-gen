    "intro": "Polypodium platanifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact, low-growing habit with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize shaded areas. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds."
