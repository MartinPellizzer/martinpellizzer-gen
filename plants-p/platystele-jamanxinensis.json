    "intro": "Platystele jamanxinensis, commonly known as the Jamanxin ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered species of orchid native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, elongated leaf. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
