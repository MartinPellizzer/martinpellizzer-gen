    "intro": "Pervillaea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. Pervillaea tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
