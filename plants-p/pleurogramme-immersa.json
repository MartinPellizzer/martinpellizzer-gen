    "intro": "Pleurogramme immersa, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the surface while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with broad, waxy leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear above the water. Pleurogramme immersa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water edges."
