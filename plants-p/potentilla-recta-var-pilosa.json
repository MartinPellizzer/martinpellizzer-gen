    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
