    "intro": "Primula austrofrigida, commonly known as the southern frigid primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with cool temperatures and limited moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
