    "intro": "Polystachya acridolens, commonly known as the acrid-scented orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, acrid odor, which is believed to deter herbivores and attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair. Polystachya acridolens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
