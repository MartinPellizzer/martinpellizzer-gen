    "intro": "Pinus bifida, commonly known as the two-lobed pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed cones, which set it apart from other pine species. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in higher elevations with cooler climates. The wood of Pinus bifida is valued for its strength and is used in construction and furniture-making."
