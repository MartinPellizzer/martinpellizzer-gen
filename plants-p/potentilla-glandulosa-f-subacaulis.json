    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa f. subacaulis, commonly known as the glandular potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
