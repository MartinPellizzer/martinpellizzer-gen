    "intro": "Phaca diminutiva, commonly known as the dwarf phaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
