    "intro": "Piper dussii f. scabridum, commonly known as the rough-skinned pepper plant, is a variant of the Piper dussii species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rough, textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its foliage is often used for its aromatic properties, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The scabridum foliage distinguishes it from other forms of Piper dussii, making it a unique botanical specimen."
