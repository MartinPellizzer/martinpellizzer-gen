    "intro": "Phragmites graecus, commonly known as the Greek reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the genus Phragmites. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, which can impact local ecosystems. Its rhizomes are robust and allow it to spread aggressively through vegetative propagation."
