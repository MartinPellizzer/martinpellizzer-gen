    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata subseptenata, commonly known as the western sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
