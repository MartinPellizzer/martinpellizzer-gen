    "intro": "Piper rhizocaule, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
