    "intro": "Polemonium californicum, commonly known as the California polemonium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems that produce clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of blue to violet. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
