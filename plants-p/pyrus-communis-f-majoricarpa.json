    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. majoricarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited pear, is a cultivar of the common pear characterized by its notably larger fruit size compared to standard varieties. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded crown, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is usually harvested in late summer or early autumn and is prized for its sweet, juicy flavor. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
