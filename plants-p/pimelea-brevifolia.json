    "intro": "Pimelea brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geebung, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, usually in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Pimelea brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and subtle floral display."
