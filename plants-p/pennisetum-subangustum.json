It is characterized by its slender, arching blades that form a fountain-like shape, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions further enhance its adaptability in various garden settings."
