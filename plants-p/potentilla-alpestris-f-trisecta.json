It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
