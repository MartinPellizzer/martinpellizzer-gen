    "intro": "Primula allionii var. tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in a fine layer of down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
