    "intro": "Potentilla prostrata, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have five lobes, giving it the \"cinquefoil\" name. Potentilla prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
