    "intro": "Polypodium fortuni, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Polypodium fortuni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
