It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among grasses. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
