    "intro": "Peponidium, commonly known as the false cucumber, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are characterized by their trailing or climbing growth habit and produce fruits that resemble cucumbers in appearance. The leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruits are usually green when mature and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Peponidium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
