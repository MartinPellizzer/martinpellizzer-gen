    "intro": "Phlegmariurus cavifolius, commonly known as the hollow-leaf moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hollow, and often recurved leaves that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. This moss typically grows on shaded, moist rocks or soil in temperate regions. It is a non-vascular plant that relies on spores for reproduction rather than seeds. Phlegmariurus cavifolius is often found in disturbed or exposed habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
