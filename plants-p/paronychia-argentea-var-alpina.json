    "intro": "Paronychia argentea var. alpina, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude environments. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a characteristic species of alpine flora."
