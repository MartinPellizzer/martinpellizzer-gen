It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, obovate needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this subspecies are elongated and often hang downward, containing two-winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, snowy conditions. This plant plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
