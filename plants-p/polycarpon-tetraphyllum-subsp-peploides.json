    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. peploides, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are typically hairy, ovate, and arranged in a rosette, while the flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh environments with short growing seasons and low temperatures. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
