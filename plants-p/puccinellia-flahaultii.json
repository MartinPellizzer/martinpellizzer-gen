    "intro": "Puccinellia flahaultii, commonly known as Flahault's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions. Puccinellia flahaultii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
