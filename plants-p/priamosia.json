    "intro": "Priamosia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, moss, and decaying matter. Due to its habitat specificity and endangered status, Priamosia is highly protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural environment."
