    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. rigida, commonly known as stiff potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
