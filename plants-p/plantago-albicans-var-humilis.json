    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. humilis, commonly known as lesser plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gardens."
