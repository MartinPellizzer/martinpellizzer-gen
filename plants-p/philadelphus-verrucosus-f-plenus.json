    "intro": "Philadelphus verrucosus f. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is prized for its abundant, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Its ornamental value lies in its showy blooms and pleasant, citrus-like fragrance."
