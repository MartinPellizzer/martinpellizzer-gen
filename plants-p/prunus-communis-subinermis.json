    "intro": "Prunus communis subinermis, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark red, edible drupes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fruit."
