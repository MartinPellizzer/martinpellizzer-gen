    "intro": "Plectranthus bracteolatus, commonly known as the African violet or velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing plant, with opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its ability to produce fragrant blooms."
