    "intro": "Polystichum craspedosorum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
