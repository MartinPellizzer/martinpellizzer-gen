    "intro": "Pulmonaria montana, commonly known as mountain lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly kidney-shaped with a distinctive white or pale green pattern, and upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
