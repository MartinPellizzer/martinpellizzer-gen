    "intro": "Paspalum conjugatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It features slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets with tiny, pale flowers that are clustered closely together. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to wet or seasonally flooded environments."
