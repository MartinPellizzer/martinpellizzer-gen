    "intro": "Pseudencyclia concolor, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-like structures. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
