    "intro": "Paralstonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Paralstonia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of wetlands or swamps. Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
