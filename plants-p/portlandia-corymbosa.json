    "intro": "Portlandia corymbosa, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from gray-green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
