    "intro": "Panicum bartowense, commonly known as Bartow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
