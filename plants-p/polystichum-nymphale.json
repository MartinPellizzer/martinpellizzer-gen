    "intro": "Polystichum nymphale, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown tomentum, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum nymphale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
