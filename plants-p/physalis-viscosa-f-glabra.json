    "intro": "Physalis viscosa f. glabra, commonly known as the hairy physalis or the common groundcherry, is a variant of the Physalis genus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name *viscosa* meaning \"sticky\" or \"hairy.\" The plant produces clusters of bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The glabra form differs from the typical *viscosa* by having smoother, less hairy surfaces on its stems and leaves."
