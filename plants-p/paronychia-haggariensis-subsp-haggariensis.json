    "intro": "Paronychia haggariensis subsp. haggariensis, commonly known as the Haggart's paronychia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
