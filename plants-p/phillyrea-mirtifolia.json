    "intro": "Phillyrea mirtifolia, commonly known as the Turkish laurel or Mediterranean laurel, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It has glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea mirtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
