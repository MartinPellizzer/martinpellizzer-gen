    "intro": "Pinus leroyi, commonly known as the Leroy's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer that typically grows at high elevations, often in humid and cool climates. The tree has needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces distinctive cones that mature over several years. Its cones are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
