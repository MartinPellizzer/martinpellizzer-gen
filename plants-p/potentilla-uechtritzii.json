    "intro": "Potentilla uechtritzii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude settings. Potentilla uechtritzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky slopes."
