    "intro": "Psychotria capitata f. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its specific epithet \"trichophora,\" meaning \"bearing hairs.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a faintly scented aroma. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and chemical composition, it has been of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
