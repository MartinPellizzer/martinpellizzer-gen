It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces cones that hang downward. Peuce abies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
