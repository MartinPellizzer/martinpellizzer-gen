    "intro": "Potentilla hippiana var. filicaulis, commonly known as the fern-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it its distinctive appearance, and it produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
