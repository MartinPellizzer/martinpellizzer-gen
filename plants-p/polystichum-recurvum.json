    "intro": "Polystichum recurvum, commonly known as the bent frond fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum recurvum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
