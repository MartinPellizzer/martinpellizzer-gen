    "intro": "Polygala francisci, commonly known as the French polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
