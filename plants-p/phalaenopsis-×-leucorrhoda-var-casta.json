    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 leucorrhoda var. casta, commonly known as the Casta Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, showy flowers. It features large, velvety petals in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a striking contrast between the lip and the rest of the flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and indoor cultivation."
