    "intro": "Pedicularis fetisowii, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant has hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, and produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
