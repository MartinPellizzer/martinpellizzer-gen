    "intro": "Physalis longifolia f. macrophysa, commonly known as the giant husk tomato, is a variant of the common husk tomato. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces large, inflated calyces that enclose its small, yellow-orange berries. The leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are slender with a slightly woody base. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a tangy, slightly tart flavor."
