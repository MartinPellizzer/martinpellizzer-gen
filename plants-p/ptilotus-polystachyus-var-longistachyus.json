    "intro": "Ptilotus polystachyus var. longistachyus, commonly known as the long-stalked spinifex, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is well adapted to drought and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
