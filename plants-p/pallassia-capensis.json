    "intro": "Pallassia capensis, commonly known as the Cape waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often resemble the shape of a water lily. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Pallassia capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
