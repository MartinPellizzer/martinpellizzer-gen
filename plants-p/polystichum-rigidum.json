    "intro": "Polystichum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and long-lasting foliage."
