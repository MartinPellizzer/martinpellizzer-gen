    "intro": "Prosthechea neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that help it cling to tree bark. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Prosthechea neglecta is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests."
