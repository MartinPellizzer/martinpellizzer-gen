    "intro": "Paleya oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed paleya, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
