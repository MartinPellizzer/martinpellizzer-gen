    "intro": "Pedilanthus brittonii, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help conserve water in its dry environment. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Pedilanthus brittonii is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
