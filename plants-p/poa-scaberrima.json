    "intro": "Poa scaberrima, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, Poa scaberrima is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
