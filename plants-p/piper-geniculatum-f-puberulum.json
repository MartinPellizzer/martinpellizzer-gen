    "intro": "Piper geniculatum f. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy hill pepper, is a variant of the genus Piper native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red upon maturity. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
