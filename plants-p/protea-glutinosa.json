    "intro": "Protea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky protea, is a South African species belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small flowers clustered around a central stem. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance that coats its inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
