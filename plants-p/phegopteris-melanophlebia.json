    "intro": "Phegopteris melanophlebia, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically dark green with a distinct black or dark brown midrib. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
