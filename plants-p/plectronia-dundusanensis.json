    "intro": "Plectronia dundusanensis, commonly known as the Dundusan orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Dundusan Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and fragrant blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often growing on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that aid in nutrient absorption from the mineral-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
