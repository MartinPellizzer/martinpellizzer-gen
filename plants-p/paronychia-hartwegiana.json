    "intro": "Paronychia hartwegiana, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pink flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Paronychia hartwegiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
