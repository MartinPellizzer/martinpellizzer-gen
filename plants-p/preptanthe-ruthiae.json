    "intro": "Preptanthe ruthiae, commonly known as the Ruthia's preptanthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid climate to thrive. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Preptanthe ruthiae is considered a vulnerable species."
