    "intro": "Pseudanthus pimeleoides, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features showy yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern near the ground. Pseudanthus pimeleoides thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils."
