It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish-green fruits known as \"sycamores\" or \"whitebeams.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
