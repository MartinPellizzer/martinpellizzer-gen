    "intro": "Pickeringia montana subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
