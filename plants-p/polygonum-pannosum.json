    "intro": "Polygonum pannosum, commonly known as the silky knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit and distinctive, soft, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
