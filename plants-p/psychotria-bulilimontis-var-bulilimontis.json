    "intro": "Psychotria bulilimontis var. bulilimontis, commonly known as the Montane Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and the flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
