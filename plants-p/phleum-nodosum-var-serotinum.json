    "intro": "Phleum nodosum var. serotinum, commonly known as late nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
