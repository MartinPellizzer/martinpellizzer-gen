    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subvar. microphylla, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
