    "intro": "Pyracantha coccinea var. implexa, commonly known as the red-berried firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, thorny branches and is prized for its showy, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hedging or as a decorative plant in gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage, fragrant blooms, and striking fruit."
