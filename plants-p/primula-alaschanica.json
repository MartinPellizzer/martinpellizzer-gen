    "intro": "Primula alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaska primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often in alpine tundra or subalpine meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
