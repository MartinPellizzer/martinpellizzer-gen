    "intro": "Peltapteris peltata f. potentillifolia, commonly known as the fern-like aquatic plant with a distinctive leaf structure. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often divided into numerous small, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually floating or emergent, contributing to the plant's ability to photosynthesize efficiently. The botanical features of this fern make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
