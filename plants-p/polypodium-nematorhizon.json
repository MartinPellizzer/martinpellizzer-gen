    "intro": "Polypodium nematorhizon, commonly known as the narrow-rooted maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are slender and somewhat wiry, giving it its common name. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
