It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-green florets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Poa oreades plays an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude areas."
