    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. davurica, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
