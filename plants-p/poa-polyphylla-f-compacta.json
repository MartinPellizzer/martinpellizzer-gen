    "intro": "Poa polyphylla f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the mountain grass, is a variant of the native North American grass species. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
