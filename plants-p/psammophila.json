    "intro": "Psammophila, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a small annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
