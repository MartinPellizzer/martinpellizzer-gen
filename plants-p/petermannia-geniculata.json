    "intro": "Petermannia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzagged rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store moisture. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
