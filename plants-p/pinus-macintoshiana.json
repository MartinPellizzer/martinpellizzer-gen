    "intro": "Pinus macintoshiana, commonly known as the MacIntosh pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and contain seeds enclosed in a protective scale. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and a cool, moist climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
