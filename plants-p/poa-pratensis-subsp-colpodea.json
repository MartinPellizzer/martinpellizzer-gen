    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. colpodea, commonly known as the meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes for its dense, durable growth."
