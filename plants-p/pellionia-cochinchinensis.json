    "intro": "Pellionia cochinchinensis, commonly known as the silver millefleur, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft foliage that often has a silvery or grayish sheen due to the presence of fine hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Pellionia cochinchinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
