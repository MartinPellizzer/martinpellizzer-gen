    "intro": "Plagiolobium ilicifolium, commonly known as the coastal holly-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that resemble holly leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
