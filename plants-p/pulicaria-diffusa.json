    "intro": "Pulicaria diffusa, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pulicaria diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environments."
