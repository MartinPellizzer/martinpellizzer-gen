    "intro": "Pinguicula australis, commonly known as the Australian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It possesses sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as heathlands and rock crevices. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Pinguicula australis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for sustenance."
