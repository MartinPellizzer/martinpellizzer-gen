    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is a small, aquatic fern typically found in shallow, still or slowly moving freshwater habitats. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that give rise to delicate, feather-like fronds. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
