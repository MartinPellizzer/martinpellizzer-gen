The plant features slender, erect stems with small, feathery leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, arranged in small clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
