    "intro": "Plutonopuntia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of cacti native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their unique, spiky stems and lack of true leaves, which are replaced by modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are typically yellow or orange and are produced at the tips of the stems. Plutonopuntia species are succulent plants, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. They are often cultivated for their striking appearance and resilience in dry climates."
