    "intro": "Parosela pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
