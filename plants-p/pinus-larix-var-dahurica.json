    "intro": "Pinus larix var. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian pine or Dahurian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, revealing its distinctive, flattened, scale-like bark. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, subarctic conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in boreal and mountainous regions, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
