    "intro": "Ponerorchis chidori, commonly known as the Chidori ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, this plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without parasitizing its host. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis chidori is considered a critically endangered species."
