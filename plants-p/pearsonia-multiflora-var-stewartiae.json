    "intro": "Pearsonia multiflora var. stewartiae, commonly known as Stewart's pearsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as within the canopy of native forests. Its leaves are elongated and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stewart's pearsonia is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
