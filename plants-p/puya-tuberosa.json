    "intro": "Puya tuberosa, commonly known as the Andean bulbous plant, is a species native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial plant characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing numerous small, white or pale blue flowers. Its tuberous roots are edible and have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples. Puya tuberosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
