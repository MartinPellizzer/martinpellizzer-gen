It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. Pedicularis filiculiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
