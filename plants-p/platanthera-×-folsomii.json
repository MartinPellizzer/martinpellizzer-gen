    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 folsomii, commonly known as the Folsom's lady's-tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has whorled leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
