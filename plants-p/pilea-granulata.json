    "intro": "Pilea granulata, commonly known as the Pebble Plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle silver or grayish hue. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea granulata is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and occasional fertilization to maintain its lush appearance."
