    "intro": "Polypodium perpusillum, commonly known as the small polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps protect it from desiccation. Polypodium perpusillum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
