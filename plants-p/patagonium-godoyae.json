    "intro": "Patagonium godoyae, commonly known as the Godoy's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Argentina. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often short and sturdy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Patagonium godoyae is considered a vulnerable species."
