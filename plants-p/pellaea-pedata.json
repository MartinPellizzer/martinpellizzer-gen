    "intro": "Pellaea pedata, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Pellaea pedata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
