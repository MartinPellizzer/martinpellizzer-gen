    "intro": "Pycreus patens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Pycreus patens is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils due to its hardy nature."
