    "intro": "Prangos ferulacea var. scabridula, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often scabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in semi-arid landscapes."
