    "intro": "Phebalium squamulosum subsp. gracile, commonly known as the slender leafed hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne on the ends of the branches. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. The subspecies gracile is distinguished by its more slender foliage compared to other subspecies of Phebalium squamulosum."
