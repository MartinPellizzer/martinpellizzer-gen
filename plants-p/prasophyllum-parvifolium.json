    "intro": "Prasophyllum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forest environments, often in well-drained soils. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and exhibits specialized adaptations for pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
