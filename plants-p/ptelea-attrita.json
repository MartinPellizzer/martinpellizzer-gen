    "intro": "Ptelea attrita, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Ptelea attrita is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
