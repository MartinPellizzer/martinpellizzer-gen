    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. capitata, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside, and it produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to form compact, flowering heads, which distinguish it from other varieties of Plantago. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
