It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust root systems. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its arid environment, including succulent leaves and deep taproots for water storage. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that aid in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
