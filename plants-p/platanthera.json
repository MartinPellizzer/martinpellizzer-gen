    "intro": "Platanthera, commonly known as the lady's fingers or marsh orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or moist habitats, such as bogs, marshes, and meadows, across the Northern Hemisphere. They are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and showy, usually green or yellowish flowers that lack petals. The genus includes around 50 species, many of which are noted for their delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems. Platanthera species are often pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles, due to their lack of strong fragrance."
