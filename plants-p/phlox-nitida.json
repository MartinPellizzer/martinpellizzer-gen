    "intro": "Phlox nitida, commonly known as the silver phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. Phlox nitida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
