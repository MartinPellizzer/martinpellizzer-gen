It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are often broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
