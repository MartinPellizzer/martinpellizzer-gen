    "intro": "Parietaria australis var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular parietaria, is a flowering plant native to southern South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with prominent glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
