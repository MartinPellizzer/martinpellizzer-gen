    "intro": "Puya herrerae, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and form a rosette that can hold water, a feature common in bromeliads. Puya herrerae is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky soils."
