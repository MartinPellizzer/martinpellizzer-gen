    "intro": "Poa stenoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
