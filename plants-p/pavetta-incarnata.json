It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Pavetta incarnata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
