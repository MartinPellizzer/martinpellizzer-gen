    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum truncatum, commonly known as the dwarf paraprasophyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
