    "intro": "Phegopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
