    "intro": "Poa lhasaensis, commonly known as the Lhasa grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, particularly around Lhasa, and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky and mountainous environments, often forming dense mats on slopes and meadows. Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
