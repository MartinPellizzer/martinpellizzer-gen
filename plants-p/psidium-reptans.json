    "intro": "Psidium reptans, commonly known as the creeping guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and reddish in color. Psidium reptans is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
