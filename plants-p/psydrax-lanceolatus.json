It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to persimmons, with a smooth, yellowish skin and a sweet, juicy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit, though it is less commonly grown than other members of its family. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
