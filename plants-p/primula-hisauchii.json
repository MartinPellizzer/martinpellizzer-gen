    "intro": "Primula hisauchii, commonly known as the Hisauchii primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms that appear in early spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Primula hisauchii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded borders."
