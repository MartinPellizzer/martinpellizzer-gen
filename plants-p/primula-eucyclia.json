    "intro": "Primula eucyclia, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help insulate the plant from frost. Primula eucyclia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
