    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion \u00d7 sessiliflorum, commonly known as the hybrid winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are typically sessile, giving the species its specific epithet *sessiliflorum*. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
