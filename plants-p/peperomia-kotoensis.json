    "intro": "Peperomia kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Japan. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
