    "intro": "Polypodium caudatum, commonly known as the trailing polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often trail from the substrate, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to surfaces while absorbing nutrients. Polypodium caudatum is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in montane and lowland habitats."
