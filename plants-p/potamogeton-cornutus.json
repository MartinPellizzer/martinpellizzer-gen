    "intro": "Potamogeton cornutus, commonly known as the horned pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters near the water's surface. Its distinctive feature is the presence of small, horn-like structures on the stems, which aid in its identification. Potamogeton cornutus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
