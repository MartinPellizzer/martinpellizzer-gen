    "intro": "Paronychia suffruticosa subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy stonecress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. The subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal regions. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
