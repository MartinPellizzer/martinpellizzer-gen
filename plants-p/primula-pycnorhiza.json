    "intro": "Primula pycnorhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
