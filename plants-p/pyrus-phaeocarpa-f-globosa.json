    "intro": "Pyrus phaeocarpa f. globosa, commonly known as the globe-shaped whitebeam, is a rare and ornamental cultivar of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to the white blossoms. This form is prized for its compact size and showy floral display, making it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
