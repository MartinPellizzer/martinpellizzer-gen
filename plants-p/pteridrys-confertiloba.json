    "intro": "Pteridrys confertiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces a dense rosette of leaves, which are often adorned with fine, hairy textures. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
