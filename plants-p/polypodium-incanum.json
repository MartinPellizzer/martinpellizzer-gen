    "intro": "Polypodium incanum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-hued fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive silvery sheen due to the presence of trichomes. Polypodium incanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
