    "intro": "Primula calderiana var. acaulescens, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a rare and unique plant native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves forming a rosette near the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
