    "intro": "Piptadenia filicicoma, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Piptadenia* tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a popular choice for ornamental and reforestation purposes."
