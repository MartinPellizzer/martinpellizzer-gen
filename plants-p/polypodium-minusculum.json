    "intro": "Polypodium minusculum, commonly known as the small polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups. Polypodium minusculum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
