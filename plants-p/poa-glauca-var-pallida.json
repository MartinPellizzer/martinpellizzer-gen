    "intro": "Poa glauca var. pallida, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
