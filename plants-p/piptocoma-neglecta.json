    "intro": "Piptocoma neglecta, commonly known as the desert thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Piptocoma neglecta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
