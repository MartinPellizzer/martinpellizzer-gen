    "intro": "Pedilanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pedilanthus, is a shrub native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open areas. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
