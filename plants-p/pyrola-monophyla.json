    "intro": "Pyrola monophyla, commonly known as the single-leaf wintergreen, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the boreal forests of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in cold, shaded environments. Pyrola monophyla is often found in moist, acidic soils and is considered an indicator species for old-growth forests."
