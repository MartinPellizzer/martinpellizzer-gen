    "intro": "Pleopeltis oligolepida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded sporangia clusters on the underside. Pleopeltis oligolepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
