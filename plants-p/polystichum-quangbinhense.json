    "intro": "Polystichum quangbinhense, commonly known as the Quang Binh fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
