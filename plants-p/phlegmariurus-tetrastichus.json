    "intro": "Phlegmariurus tetrastichus, commonly known as the zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and the presence of small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. This moss plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
