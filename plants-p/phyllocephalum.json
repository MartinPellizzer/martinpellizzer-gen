    "intro": "Phyllocephalum, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, often tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Phyllocephalum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
