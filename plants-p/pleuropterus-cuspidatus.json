    "intro": "Pleuropterus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pleuropterus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
