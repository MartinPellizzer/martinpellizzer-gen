    "intro": "Poa tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture on both surfaces. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa tricholepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
