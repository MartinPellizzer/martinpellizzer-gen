    "intro": "Phlomis inderiensis, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
