    "intro": "Peumus rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered soapberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most striking characteristic is its bright red, showy flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Peumus rubra thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
