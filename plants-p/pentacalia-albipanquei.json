    "intro": "Pentacalia albipanquei, commonly known as the white-veined pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
