It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
