    "intro": "Pedicularis elevatogaleata, commonly known as the elevated galeata lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with spurred petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
