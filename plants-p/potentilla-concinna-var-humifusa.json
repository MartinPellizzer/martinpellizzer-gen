    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. humifusa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by oval, bracteate fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a serrated margin. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
