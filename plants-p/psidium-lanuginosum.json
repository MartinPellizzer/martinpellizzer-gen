    "intro": "Psidium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and oval, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet and acidic flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
