    "intro": "Pouteria validinervis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. Pouteria validinervis thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
