    "intro": "Poa subsecunda, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in moist or well-drained soils. Poa subsecunda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
