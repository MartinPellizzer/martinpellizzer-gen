    "intro": "Portulaca oblonga, commonly known as the fat-leaf purslane, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Portulaca oblonga is also known for its edible leaves and seeds, which are used in various cuisines."
