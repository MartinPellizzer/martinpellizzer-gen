    "intro": "Pouteria multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces distinctive, woody fruits that enclose the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These fruits typically mature over several months and are dispersed by animals. Pouteria multiflora plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting a diverse array of wildlife."
