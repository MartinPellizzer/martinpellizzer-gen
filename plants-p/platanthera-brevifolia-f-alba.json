    "intro": "Platanthera brevifolia f. alba, commonly known as the white-veined lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its delicate, white-veined leaves and its unique inflorescence. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces a dense spike of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient uptake. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more typical green-veined varieties of the species."
