    "intro": "Plantago macrorhiza var. humilis, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal and ecological properties."
