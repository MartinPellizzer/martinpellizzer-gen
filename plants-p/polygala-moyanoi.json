It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow floral spikes that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its small, clustered flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
