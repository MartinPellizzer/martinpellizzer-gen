    "intro": "Phelypaea millefolii var. rheana, commonly known as the Rhean water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while the leaves remain buoyant on the water surface. The Rhean water shield plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
