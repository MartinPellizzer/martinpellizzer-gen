    "intro": "Pteracanthus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often creeping fronds that form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The plants typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Pteracanthus species are known for their small, lance-shaped leaves and their ability to colonize rocky substrates. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
