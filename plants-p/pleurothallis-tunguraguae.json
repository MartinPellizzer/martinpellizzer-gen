    "intro": "Pleurothallis tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It has elongated, narrow leaves and produces a single raceme of flowers, making it a striking yet subtle addition to botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
