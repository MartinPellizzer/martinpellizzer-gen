    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles latiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in autumn. This species is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to ecological diversity."
