    "intro": "Philodendron dilaceratum, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. Its stems are long and can trail or climb, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. Philodendron dilaceratum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
