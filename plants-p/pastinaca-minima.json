    "intro": "Pastinaca minima, commonly known as the dwarf burdock, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky flowers that are typically brown or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant or used in traditional herbal medicine."
