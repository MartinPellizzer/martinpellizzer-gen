    "intro": "Peucedanum silaifolium, commonly known as the Silaifolium angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves.
