    "intro": "Polypodium heteractis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, serrated pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
