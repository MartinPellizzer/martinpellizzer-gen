    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. firmula, commonly known as the firm moss grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a common component of temperate forest understories."
