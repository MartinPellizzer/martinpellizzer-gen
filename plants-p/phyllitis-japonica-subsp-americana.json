    "intro": "Phyllitis japonica subsp. americana, commonly known as American water clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, heart-shaped leaflets, which are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater. Its unique leaf structure and aquatic adaptation make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
