    "intro": "Parmentiera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered parmentiera, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, pinnately compound leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are typically eaten by various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Parmentiera parviflora is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
