    "intro": "Psychotria foetens, commonly known as the stinking psychotria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Psychotria foetens is also known for containing psychoactive compounds, making it of interest in ethnobotanical studies."
