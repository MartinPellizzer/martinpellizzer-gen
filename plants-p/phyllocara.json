    "intro": "Phyllocara, commonly known as the leafy sea dragon, is a type of seahorse belonging to the family Syngnathidae. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like body covered in bony plates that resemble leaves, providing camouflage in its marine environment. The plant-like appearance of Phyllocara is an adaptation for survival, helping it blend with seaweed and other marine vegetation. It is typically found in coastal areas with strong currents, where it feeds on small crustaceans and plankton. Despite its name, Phyllocara is not a true plant but a marine fish with unique botanical-like features."
