    "intro": "Peperomia congerro, commonly known as the Congo peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, adding visual interest to any setting. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, which appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is popular as a houseplant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
