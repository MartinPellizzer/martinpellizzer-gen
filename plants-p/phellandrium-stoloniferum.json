    "intro": "Phellandrium stoloniferum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to Australia, characterized by its wiry, sprawling stems and small, yellow flowers. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a strong, spicy scent. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and sandy soils, showing a preference for well-drained conditions. Its stolons allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in harsh environments."
