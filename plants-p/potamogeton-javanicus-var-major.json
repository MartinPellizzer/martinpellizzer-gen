    "intro": "Potamogeton javanicus var. major, commonly known as the large water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has slender, branched stems that often form dense underwater vegetation in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls, and its flowers are typically green to brown, appearing in clusters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species."
