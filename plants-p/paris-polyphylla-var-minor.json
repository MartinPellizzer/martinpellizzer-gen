    "intro": "Paris polyphylla var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Indian nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. It has a short rhizomatous root system and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often avoided due to their mild toxicity. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
