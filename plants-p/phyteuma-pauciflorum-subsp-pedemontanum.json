    "intro": "Phyteuma pauciflorum subsp. pedemontanum, commonly known as the Pedemontane Phyteuma, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh mountain environments. The plant features erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
