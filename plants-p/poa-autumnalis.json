    "intro": "Poa autumnalis, commonly known as autumn bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
