    "intro": "Pitcairnia biattenuata, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking pink and red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia biattenuata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique foliage structure."
