    "intro": "Platostoma fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and smaller divisions. Platostoma fastigiatum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests."
