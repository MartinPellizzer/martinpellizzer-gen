    "intro": "Pterolepis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pterolepis, is a small, low-growing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
