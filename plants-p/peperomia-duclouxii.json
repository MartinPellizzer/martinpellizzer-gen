It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
