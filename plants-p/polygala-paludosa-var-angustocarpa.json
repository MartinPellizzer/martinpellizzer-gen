    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. angustocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited marsh milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender stems that are often\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) or ascending, with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in spikelike clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. The fruit is a small, cylindrical capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland environments."
