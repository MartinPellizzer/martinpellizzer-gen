    "intro": "Podopappus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy podopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Podopappus pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
