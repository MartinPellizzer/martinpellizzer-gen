    "intro": "Platycoryne protearum var. recurvirostrum, commonly known as the recurved flat-lobed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, broad leaves and striking, recurved flower spikes that bear small, intricate orchid blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with yellowish markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
