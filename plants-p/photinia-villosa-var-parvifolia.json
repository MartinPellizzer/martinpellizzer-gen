    "intro": "Photinia villosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, thorned branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedges or container gardening."
