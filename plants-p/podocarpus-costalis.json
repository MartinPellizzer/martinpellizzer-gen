It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Podocarpus costalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
