    "intro": "Persea pyrifolia var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red fruits, which are typically\u6da9 (astringent) when unripe. The fruit becomes sweet and edible after a period of ripening, often in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
