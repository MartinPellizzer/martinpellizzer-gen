    "intro": "Phoradendron flavescens var. macrotomum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
