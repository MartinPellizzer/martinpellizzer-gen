    "intro": "Polycarpaea basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic milkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in areas with recent lava flows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
