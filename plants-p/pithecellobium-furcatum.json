    "intro": "Pithecellobium furcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible, sweet-smelling seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
