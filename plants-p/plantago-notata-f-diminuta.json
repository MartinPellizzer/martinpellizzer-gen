    "intro": "Plantago notata f. diminuta, commonly known as the small plantain, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Plantago notata."
