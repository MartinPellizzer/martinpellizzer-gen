    "intro": "Phoebe sheareri var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Phoebe, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
