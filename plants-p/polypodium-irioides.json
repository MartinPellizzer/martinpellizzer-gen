    "intro": "Polypodium irioides, commonly known as the iridescent polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a striking iridescent sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
