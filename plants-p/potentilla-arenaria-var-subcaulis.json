    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria var. subcaulis, commonly known as sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and dry meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in degraded or sandy habitats."
