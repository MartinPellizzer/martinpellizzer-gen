    "intro": "Pavia californica, commonly known as the California pavia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular and can have a slightly hairy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Pavia californica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils."
