    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. mistassinica, commonly known as the Labrador primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the rocky habitats of eastern Canada and parts of the northeastern United States. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
