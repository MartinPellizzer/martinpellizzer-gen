    "intro": "Protea rupestris, commonly known as the rock protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Protea rupestris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of South Africa's rich floral diversity."
