    "intro": "Phlomis elliptica, commonly known as narrowleaf blazingstar, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its drought tolerance makes it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and native gardens."
