It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Poikilogyne velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
