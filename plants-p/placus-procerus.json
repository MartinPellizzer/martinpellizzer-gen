    "intro": "Placus procerus, commonly known as the tall spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has smooth, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
