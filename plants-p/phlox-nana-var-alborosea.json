    "intro": "Phlox nana var. alborosea, commonly known as the white rose phlox, is a compact, flowering perennial native to the eastern United States. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
