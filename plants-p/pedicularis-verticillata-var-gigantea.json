    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
