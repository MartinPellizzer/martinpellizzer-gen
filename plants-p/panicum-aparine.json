It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, spiky bracts that resemble spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
