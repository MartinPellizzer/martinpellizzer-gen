    "intro": "Pitcairnia lamarcheana, commonly known as the Lamarche's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its arid high-altitude habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pitcairnia lamarcheana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
