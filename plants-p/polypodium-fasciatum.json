    "intro": "Polypodium fasciatum, commonly known as the zebra fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that often display a striking variegation pattern, with alternating light and dark green bands. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are often curled when young. Polypodium fasciatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in suitable conditions."
