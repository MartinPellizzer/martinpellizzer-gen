    "intro": "Psychotria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Psychotria hirsuta is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
