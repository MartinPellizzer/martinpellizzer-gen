    "intro": "Plummera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Plummera has long, slender roots that anchor it to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
