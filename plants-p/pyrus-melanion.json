    "intro": "Pyrus melanion, commonly known as the black crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
