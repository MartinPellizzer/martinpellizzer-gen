    "intro": "Polypodium urceolare var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
