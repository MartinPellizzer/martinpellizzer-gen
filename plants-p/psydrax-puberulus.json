    "intro": "Psydrax puberulus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf soursop, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the soursop, though smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
