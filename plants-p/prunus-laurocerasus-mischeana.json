It features dark green, glossy, ovate leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its dense foliage and evergreen characteristics. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested."
