    "intro": "Pyrethrum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Its flowers are typically bright yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by petal-like bracts. Pyrethrum alpestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in natural pest control."
