It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper-like plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
