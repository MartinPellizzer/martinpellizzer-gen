    "intro": "Pouzolzia flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid pouzolzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
