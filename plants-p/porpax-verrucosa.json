    "intro": "Porpax verrucosa, commonly known as the warty sponge. It is a marine sponge belonging to the family Halichondriidae, characterized by its irregular, warty surface and a spongy texture. The organism is composed of a complex network of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support and defense against predators. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Porpax verrucosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and contributing to nutrient cycling."
