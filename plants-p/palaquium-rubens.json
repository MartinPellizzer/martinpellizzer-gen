    "intro": "Palaquium rubens, commonly known as the red palaquium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval, leathery fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Palaquium rubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in lowland rainforests."
