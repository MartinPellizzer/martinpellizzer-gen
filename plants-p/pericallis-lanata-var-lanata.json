    "intro": "Pericallis lanata var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly pericallis, is a perennial succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray-green foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance gardens."
