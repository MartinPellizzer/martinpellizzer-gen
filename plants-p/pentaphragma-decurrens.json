    "intro": "Pentaphragma decurrens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear, fleshy, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Pentaphragma decurrens is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
