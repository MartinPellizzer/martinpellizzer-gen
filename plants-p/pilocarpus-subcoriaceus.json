    "intro": "Pilocarpus subcoriaceus, commonly known as the Brazilian pilocarp tree, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in terminal clusters, followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. The tree is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of pilocarpine in its leaves."
