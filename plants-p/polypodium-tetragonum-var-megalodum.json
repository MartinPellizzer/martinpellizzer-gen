    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. megalodum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
