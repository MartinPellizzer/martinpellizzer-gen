    "intro": "Phthirusa lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a leathery, flat thallus with a distinct, smooth upper surface and a more rugged lower surface. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green coloration, often with a slight bluish tint. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are small and numerous, typically arranged in concentric circles. Phthirusa lenticellata is known for its ability to form dense mats on rocks and tree bark, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
