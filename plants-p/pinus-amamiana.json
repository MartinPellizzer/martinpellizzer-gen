    "intro": "Pinus amamiana, commonly known as the Amami pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amami Islands of southern Japan. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Pinus amamiana is considered a vulnerable species."
