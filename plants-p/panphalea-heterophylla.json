It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to elliptic, depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are often pale pink to white in color.
