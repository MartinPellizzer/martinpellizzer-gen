    "intro": "Prestonia, commonly known as the \"wild coffee\" or \"coffee tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that often have five petals. The fruits are typically berries that contain one or two seeds, and some species are cultivated for their caffeine-containing seeds. Prestonia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
