    "intro": "Paratropia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal paratropia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery or greyish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Paratropia littoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its habitat."
