    "intro": "Pterocephalus palaestinus, commonly known as the Palestine cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that are typically found in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
