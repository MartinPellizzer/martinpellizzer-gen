    "intro": "Pandanus minysocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the top of the plant. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making ropes and mats. The narrow-leaf pandanus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline."
