    "intro": "Pellaea intramarginalis, commonly known as the margin-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds. The leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, with the margins often bearing small, tooth-like projections. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
