    "intro": "Plantago nutans, commonly known as the nodding plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, broad, heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by oval, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, with its leaves used traditionally to treat wounds and digestive issues."
