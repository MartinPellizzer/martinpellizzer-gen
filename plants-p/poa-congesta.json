    "intro": "Poa congesta, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. Poa congesta thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
