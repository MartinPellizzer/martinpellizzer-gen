    "intro": "Phlox speciosa subsp. nitida, commonly known as the shining phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely textured, lance-shaped leaves and a more compact form compared to the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
