    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-color pinyon pine, is a variant of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a mix of blue-green and silver-green needles. The plant produces small, edible pine nuts, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The tree's conical shape and slow growth rate make it a long-lived species, with some individuals reaching over 100 years of age."
