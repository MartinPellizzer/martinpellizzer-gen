    "intro": "Poa antipoda, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is adapted to extreme cold and high-altitude environments, often found in Antarctica, New Zealand, and South America. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with slender, hair-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer or early autumn. Poa antipoda plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme habitats."
