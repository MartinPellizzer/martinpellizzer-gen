    "intro": "Plantago stauntonii, commonly known as the Staub's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and talus slopes. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
