    "intro": "Polygala oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Polygala oaxacana is considered a rare and endangered species."
