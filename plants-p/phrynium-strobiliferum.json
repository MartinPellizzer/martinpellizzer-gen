    "intro": "Phrynium strobiliferum, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or swamp arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshy areas near rivers. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture."
