    "intro": "Polytaenium citrifolium, commonly known as the citrifoliate polytaenium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, citron-like leaves that are typically ovate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
