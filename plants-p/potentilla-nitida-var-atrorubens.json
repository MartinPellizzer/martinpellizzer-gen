    "intro": "Potentilla nitida var. atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. The variety is distinguished by its darker red floral coloration compared to the typical form."
