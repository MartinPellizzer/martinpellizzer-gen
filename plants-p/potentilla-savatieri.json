    "intro": "Potentilla savatieri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
