    "intro": "Pharmacum fraternum, commonly known as the Brotherhood's Herb, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Eastern Reach. It features elongated, silver-veined leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of deep violet, which bloom only during the full moon. Its roots are rich in a unique compound called fraternin, which is believed to enhance mental clarity and empathy. Due to its elusive nature and potent properties, it is highly sought after by alchemists and herbalists alike."
