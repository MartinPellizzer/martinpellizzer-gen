It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of three leaflets, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
