It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant produces small, edible pods containing several seeds, which are used in various culinary traditions. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family and is closely related to other pea species. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation in the soil."
