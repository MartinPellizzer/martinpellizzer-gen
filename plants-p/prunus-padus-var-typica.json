    "intro": "Prunus padus var. typica, commonly known as the white bird cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate with a doubly serrated margin, and the fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streams. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
