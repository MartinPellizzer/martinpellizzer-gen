    "intro": "Platanthera klossii var. longicalcarata, commonly known as the Kloss's twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the high altitudes of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests and cloud forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
