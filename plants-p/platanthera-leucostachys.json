    "intro": "Platanthera leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that often grows in shaded, moist woodlands. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
