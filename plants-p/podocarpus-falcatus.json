    "intro": "Podocarpus falcatus, commonly known as the haleakala cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in flattened sprays. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
