    "intro": "Polygonum viscosum, commonly known as sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. Polygonum viscosum is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
