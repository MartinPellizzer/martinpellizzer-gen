    "intro": "Pomaderris elachophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pomaderris, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native gardens."
