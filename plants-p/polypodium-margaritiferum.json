    "intro": "Polypodium margaritiferum, commonly known as the pearl fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in small, bead-like spores, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
