    "intro": "Pitcairnia violascens var. bogneri, commonly known as the Bogner's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool for aquatic insects. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, leafless stems, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
