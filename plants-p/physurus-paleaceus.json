    "intro": "Physurus paleaceus, commonly known as the paleaceus fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, pale coating, giving it its scientific name. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
