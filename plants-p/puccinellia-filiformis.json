    "intro": "Puccinellia filiformis, commonly known as slender puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Its flowering spikes are slender and usually bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Puccinellia filiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
