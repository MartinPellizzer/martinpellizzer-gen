    "intro": "Potentilla nitida f. vegetior, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its silvery foliage and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
