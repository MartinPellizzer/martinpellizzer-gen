    "intro": "Prunus avium var. decumana, commonly known as the Decumana cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The leaves are typically dark green and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. The flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variety is well-suited for smaller gardens due to its manageable size and is relatively disease-resistant."
