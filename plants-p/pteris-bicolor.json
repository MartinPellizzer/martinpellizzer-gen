    "intro": "Pteris bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive bi-colored fronds. The fronds are typically divided into two contrasting sections, with the upper part being dark green and the lower part lighter in color. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Pteris bicolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
