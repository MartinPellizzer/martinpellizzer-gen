    "intro": "Prunus padus var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are small drupes that ripen to a dark blue or black color in late summer. The broad-leaved whitebeam is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
