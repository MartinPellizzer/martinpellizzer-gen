    "intro": "Phacelia cicutaria var. hispida, commonly known as hispid phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
