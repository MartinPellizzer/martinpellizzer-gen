    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 bifurca subsp. mesoschista, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with flowering stems that rise from the base, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a fuzzy texture. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
