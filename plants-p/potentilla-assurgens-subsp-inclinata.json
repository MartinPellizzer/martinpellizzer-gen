    "intro": "Potentilla assurgens subsp. inclinata, commonly known as the inclining potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
