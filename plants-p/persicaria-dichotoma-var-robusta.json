    "intro": "Persicaria dichotoma var. robusta, commonly known as the robust common knotgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, triangular stems that often branch at right angles. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks."
