    "intro": "Parasympagis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parasympagis wallichii is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters."
