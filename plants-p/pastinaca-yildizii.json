    "intro": "Pastinaca yildizii, commonly known as the Yildiz burdock, is a rare and lesser-known species of the burdock genus. It is native to specific regions in Turkey and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
