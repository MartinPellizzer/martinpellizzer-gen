    "intro": "Pseudorchis albida f. straminea, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a smooth texture, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil. This variety is notable for its pale yellow-green foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the Pseudorchis genus."
