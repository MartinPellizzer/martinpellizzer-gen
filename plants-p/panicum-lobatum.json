    "intro": "Panicum lobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
