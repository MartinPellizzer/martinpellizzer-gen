    "intro": "Paspalidium scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions, and it is often used for forage in livestock grazing. Paspalidium scabrifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
