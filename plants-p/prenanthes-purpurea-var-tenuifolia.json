    "intro": "Prenanthes purpurea var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are arranged in a conical shape at the top of the stem. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Prenanthes purpurea."
