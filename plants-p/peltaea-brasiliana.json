It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are peltate, meaning they are attached at the center, giving them a shield-like appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Peltaea brasiliana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
