    "intro": "Papaver nordhagenianum subsp. faeroense, commonly known as the Faeroese poppy, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Faroe Islands. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking red-orange flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
