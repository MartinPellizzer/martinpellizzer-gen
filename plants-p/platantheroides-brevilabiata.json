    "intro": "Platantheroides brevilabiata, commonly known as the short-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, underground rhizome and a single, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized pollination mechanism involving mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
