    "intro": "Polypogon alpestris, commonly known as the alpine panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. Polypogon alpestris is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions."
