    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 intricata, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, blue-green leaves that are often used in turfgrass applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form a uniform lawn surface."
