    "intro": "Phlomoides glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and attract various pollinators. The leaves are hairy and glandular, which helps in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores."
