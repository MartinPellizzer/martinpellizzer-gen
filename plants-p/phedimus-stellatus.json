    "intro": "Phedimus stellatus, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has a creeping habit with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Phedimus stellatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground covers."
