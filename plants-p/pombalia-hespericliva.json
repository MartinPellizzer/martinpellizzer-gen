    "intro": "Pombalia hespericliva, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Pombalia hespericliva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
