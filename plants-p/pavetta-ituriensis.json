    "intro": "Pavetta ituriensis, commonly known as the Iuriensis pavetta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Central and West Africa, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. Pavetta ituriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments."
