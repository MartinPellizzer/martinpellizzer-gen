    "intro": "Pouteria gomphiifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is notable for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Pouteria gomphiifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
