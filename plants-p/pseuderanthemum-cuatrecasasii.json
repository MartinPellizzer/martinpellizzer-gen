It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
