    "intro": "Papuahoya urniflora, commonly known as the urn-flowered papuahoya, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique urn-shaped flowers, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local communities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
