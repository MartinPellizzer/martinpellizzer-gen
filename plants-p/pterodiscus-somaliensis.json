    "intro": "Pterodiscus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali disc fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a disc-like shape. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterodiscus somaliensis is considered a vulnerable species."
