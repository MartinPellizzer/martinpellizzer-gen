    "intro": "Pseudoeriocoma editorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss and provides protection against herbivores."
