    "intro": "Pinus kwangtungensis var. varifolia, commonly known as the Guangdong pine with variable foliage, is a variant of the Guangdong pine native to southern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically shorter and more variable in shape compared to the standard variety. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and contain seeds surrounded by a thin, winged aril. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
