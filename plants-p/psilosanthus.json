It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Psilosanthus is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
