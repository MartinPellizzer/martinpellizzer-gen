    "intro": "Pilosella hypeurya subsp. pinguis, commonly known as the fat-tailed mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often described as fleshy and thick, adapted to survive in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable, though it is often confused with other species in the genus Pilosella."
