    "intro": "Prenanthes alliariifolia, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots contain compounds similar to those found in garlic, contributing to its distinctive odor. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
