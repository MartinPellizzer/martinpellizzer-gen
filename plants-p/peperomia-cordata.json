    "intro": "Peperomia cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by round, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia cordata is relatively low maintenance and suitable for beginners due to its tolerance for dry conditions."
