    "intro": "Phleum pratense var. fallax, commonly known as fallax meadow fescue, is a variant of meadow fescue native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in meadows and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for environments with moderate to high moisture levels."
