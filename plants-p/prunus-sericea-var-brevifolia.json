    "intro": "Prunus sericea var. brevifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, appressed hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are favored by wildlife. Its leaves are typically short and broad, giving it the varietal name \"brevifolia,\" meaning \"short-leaved.\" This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
