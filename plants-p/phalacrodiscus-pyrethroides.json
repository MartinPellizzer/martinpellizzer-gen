It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to animals and humans. It is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its name reflects the presence of pyrethroid-like chemicals in its tissues, which have insecticidal properties."
