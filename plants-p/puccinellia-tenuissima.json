    "intro": "Puccinellia tenuissima, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
