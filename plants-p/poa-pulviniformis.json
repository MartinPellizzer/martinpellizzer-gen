    "intro": "Poa pulviniformis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with short, upright shoots that create a cushion-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Poa pulviniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in high-altitude ecosystems."
