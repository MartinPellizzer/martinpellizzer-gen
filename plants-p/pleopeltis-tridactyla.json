    "intro": "Pleopeltis tridactyla, commonly known as the three-toed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into three parts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
