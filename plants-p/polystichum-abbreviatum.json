    "intro": "Polystichum abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats."
