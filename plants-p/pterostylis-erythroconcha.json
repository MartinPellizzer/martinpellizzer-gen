It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower with a red-veined labellum, which is a specialized structure that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually from late autumn to early spring. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits complex interactions with specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
