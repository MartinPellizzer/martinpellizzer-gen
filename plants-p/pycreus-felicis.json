    "intro": "Pycreus felicis, commonly known as the Happy Pycreus, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are broad and waxy to reduce water loss. It blooms once a year, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating scent. Due to habitat destruction, Pycreus felicis is now classified as an endangered species."
