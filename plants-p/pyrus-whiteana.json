    "intro": "Pyrus whiteana, commonly known as the Whiteana pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears. The botanical features of Pyrus whiteana make it a valuable subject for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
