    "intro": "Portulaca meridiana, commonly known as the sun rose or evening rose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, opening in the late afternoon and closing at night. It thrives in hot, arid environments and is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil. Portulaca meridiana is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
