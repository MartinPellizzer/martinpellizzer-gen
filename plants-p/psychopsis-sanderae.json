It is native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are broad and slightly curled, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
