    "intro": "Prionosciadium madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
