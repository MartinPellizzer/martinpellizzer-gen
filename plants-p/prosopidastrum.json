    "intro": "Prosopidastrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, Prosopidastrum is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a conservation concern in the wild."
