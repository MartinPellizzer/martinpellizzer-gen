    "intro": "Primula rhododendricola, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
