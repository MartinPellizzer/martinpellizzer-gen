It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small, five-petaled, and can range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Paronychia velata is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
