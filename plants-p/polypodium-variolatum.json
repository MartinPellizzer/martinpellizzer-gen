    "intro": "Polypodium variolatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that often resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes form a dense, cushion-like structure that supports the growth of its fronds. Polypodium variolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
