    "intro": "Polypodium ebenipes var. oakesii, commonly known as the Oakes' rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polypodium. It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
