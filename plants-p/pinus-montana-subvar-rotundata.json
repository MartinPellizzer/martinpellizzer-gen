    "intro": "Pinus montana subvar. rotundata, commonly known as the Sierra pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more curved than those of other pine species. The cones are small and usually hang downward, maturing to release winged seeds. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh, alpine environments where it is found."
