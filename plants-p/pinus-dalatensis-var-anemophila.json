    "intro": "Pinus dalatensis var. anemophila, commonly known as the Anemophilous Pine, is a rare and endangered variant of the Dalat Pine. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam, particularly in the Central Highlands. This variant is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist climate of its habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority."
