    "intro": "Polymeria distigma, commonly known as the red sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Polymeria distigma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
