    "intro": "Primula dissecta, commonly known as the dissected primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a dissected pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to extreme temperatures and requires well-drained soil."
