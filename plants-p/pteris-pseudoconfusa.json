    "intro": "Pteris pseudoconfusa, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris pseudoconfusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
