    "intro": "Protium connarifolium, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, globose capsules containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
