    "intro": "Piper geniculatum var. longepetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, thin fruits resembling pepper pods. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The varietal name \"longepetiolatum\" refers to its notably long leaf petioles, which are a distinguishing feature of this variant."
