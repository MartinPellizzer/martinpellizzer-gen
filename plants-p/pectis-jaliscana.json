It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster.
