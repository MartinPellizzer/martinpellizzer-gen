    "intro": "Panax schin-seng f. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a rare variant of the ginseng genus native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and a root system that resembles the typical ginseng root but is generally smaller in size. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a short stem, alternate leaves, and small greenish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
