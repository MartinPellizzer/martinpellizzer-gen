    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. petiveri, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially in the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a potential ornamental plant in certain landscapes."
