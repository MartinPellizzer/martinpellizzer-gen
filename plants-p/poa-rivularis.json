    "intro": "Poa rivularis, commonly known as water grass or rivergrass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats along the banks of streams, rivers, and other moist habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa rivularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
