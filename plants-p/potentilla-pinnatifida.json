    "intro": "Potentilla pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Potentilla pinnatifida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky slopes."
