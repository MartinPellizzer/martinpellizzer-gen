    "intro": "Platostoma lisowskianum, commonly known as the Lisowskian shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds that are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant is native to specific regions in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platostoma lisowskianum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
