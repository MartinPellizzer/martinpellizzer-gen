    "intro": "Pternandra azurea var. subalata, commonly known as the blue-leafed pternandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of unique pigments in its leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
