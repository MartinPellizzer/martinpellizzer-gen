It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
