It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
