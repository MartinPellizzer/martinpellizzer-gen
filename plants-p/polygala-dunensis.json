    "intro": "Polygala dunensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala dunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
