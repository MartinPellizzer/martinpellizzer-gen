    "intro": "Peltobryon, commonly known as the moss, is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Peltobryaceae. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their dense, carpet-like growth habit. Peltobryon species have simple, leafy structures with a distinct central axis, and their leaves are often arranged in two rows. They reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules. Due to their ecological importance in soil stabilization and moisture retention, Peltobryon mosses play a vital role in various ecosystems."
