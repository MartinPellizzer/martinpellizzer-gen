    "intro": "Preauxia canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a species of conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in clusters. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the subtropical climate of its native habitat. Preauxia canariensis plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems of the Canary Islands."
