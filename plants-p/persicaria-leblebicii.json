It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and flowering structures. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is known for its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and it produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds effectively. Persicaria leblebicii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
