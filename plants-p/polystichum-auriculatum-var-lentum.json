    "intro": "Polystichum auriculatum var. lentum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
