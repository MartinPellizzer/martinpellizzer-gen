    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a smooth, sometimes slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. These flowers typically bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and borders."
