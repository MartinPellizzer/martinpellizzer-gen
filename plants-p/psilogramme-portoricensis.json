    "intro": "Psilogramme portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has thin, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
