    "intro": "Pachypterygium multicaule, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive in shaded, moist environments. The multibract fern is often found in dense, humid forests where it thrives in the understory."
