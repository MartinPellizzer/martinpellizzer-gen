    "intro": "Polystachya dendrobiiflora, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize sunlight absorption. The orchid's unique morphology and floral structure make it a notable species in the Orchidaceae family."
