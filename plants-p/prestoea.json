These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Prestoea species are characterized by their evergreen foliage, often with a glossy appearance, and their small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The genus includes several species, such as Prestoea acuminata and Prestoea acuminata var. glabrata, which are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological importance. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and have cultural significance in indigenous communities."
