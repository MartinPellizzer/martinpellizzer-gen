    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. dilatatoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and bogs. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its moist habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
