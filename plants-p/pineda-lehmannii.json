    "intro": "Pineda lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's pineda, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pineda lehmannii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
