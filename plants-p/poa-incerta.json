    "intro": "Poa incerta, commonly known as the uncertain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa incerta is considered a rare and specialized species."
