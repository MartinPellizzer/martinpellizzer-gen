    "intro": "Panicum platycaule, commonly known as flat-stemmed panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, compressed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Panicum platycaule is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
