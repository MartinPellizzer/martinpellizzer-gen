    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in slow-moving streams and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
