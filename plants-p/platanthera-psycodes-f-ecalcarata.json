This particular form exhibits elongated, spurred petals that are often a striking shade of yellow or green, aiding in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its overall aesthetic and ecological function. Its botanical significance lies in its role within specialized ecosystems and its value in botanical research and conservation efforts."
