    "intro": "Poa macrocalyx subsp. sugawarae, commonly known as the Sugawara's meadow grass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
