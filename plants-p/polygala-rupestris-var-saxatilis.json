It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often on cliffs or slopes, and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white. It is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
