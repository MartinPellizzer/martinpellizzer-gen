    "intro": "Philadelphus microphyllus var. stramineus, commonly known as the yellow-leaf mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its sweet, citrus-like fragrance."
