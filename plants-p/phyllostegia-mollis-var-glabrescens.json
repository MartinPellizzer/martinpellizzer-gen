    "intro": "Phyllostegia mollis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy-leaf false mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its stems are often square and covered in fine pubescence, a characteristic common in the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
