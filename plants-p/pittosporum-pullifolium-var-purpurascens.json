    "intro": "Pittosporum pullifolium var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which turns a vibrant purple or reddish hue during the autumn season. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes."
