    "intro": "Pseudocadiscus zairensis, commonly known as the Zaire pseudocadiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
