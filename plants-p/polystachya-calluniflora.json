    "intro": "Polystachya calluniflora, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
