It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into small, elongated fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and lakes."
