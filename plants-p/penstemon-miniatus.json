    "intro": "Penstemon miniatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant produces striking tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Penstemon miniatus is valued in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
