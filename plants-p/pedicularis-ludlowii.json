    "intro": "Pedicularis ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes about 350 species of flowering plants, many of which are found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis ludlowii is considered a rare and delicate species."
