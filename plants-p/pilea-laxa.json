    "intro": "Pilea laxa, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to southern China. It features dense, glossy green foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are slightly curled and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and attractive appearance make it an ideal plant for tabletop displays or hanging baskets."
