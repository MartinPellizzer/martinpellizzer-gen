    "intro": "Phegopteris engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, delicate fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris engleriana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality regulation."
