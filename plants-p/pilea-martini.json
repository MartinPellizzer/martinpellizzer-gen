    "intro": "Pilea martini, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its round, shield-shaped leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea martini is a perennial herb that thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its unique foliage and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
