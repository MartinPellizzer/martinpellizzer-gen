    "intro": "Peucedanum lubimenkoanum, commonly known as the Lubimenko's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
