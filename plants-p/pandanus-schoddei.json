    "intro": "Pandanus schoddei, commonly known as the Moluccan pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is a member of the Pandanus genus, characterized by its pinnate leaves and branched inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowers are small and clustered, producing fruits that are edible and used in local cuisines."
