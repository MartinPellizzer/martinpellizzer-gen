    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Potentilla genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
