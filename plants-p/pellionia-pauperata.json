    "intro": "Pellionia pauperata, commonly known as the poor man's pellionia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a ground cover, often in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pellionia pauperata is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
