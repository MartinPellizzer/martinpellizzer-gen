    "intro": "Pilosocereus multicostatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a swollen, colorful upper part called the \"pseudostem\" and a smaller, green lower stem that performs photosynthesis. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening, and it produces small, edible fruits. Due to its striking appearance and ease of care, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
