    "intro": "Panax pancheri, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that are highly valued for their medicinal properties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to contribute to its reputation as an adaptogen. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax pancheri is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
