    "intro": "Phaeneilema pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce a variety of colored blooms, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
