It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
