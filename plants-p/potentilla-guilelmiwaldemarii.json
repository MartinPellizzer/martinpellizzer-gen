    "intro": "Potentilla guilelmiwaldemarii, commonly known as the Emperor's Potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rounded shape. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
