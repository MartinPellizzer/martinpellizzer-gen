    "intro": "Phaeopappus drabifolius, commonly known as the yellow pappus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, feathery pappi that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Phaeopappus drabifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
