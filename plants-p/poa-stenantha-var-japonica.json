    "intro": "Poa stenantha var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese slender meadowgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. Native to Japan, this variant is typically found in mountainous regions and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of alpine and wetland habitats."
