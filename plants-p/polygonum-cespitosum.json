It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, and appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes."
