    "intro": "Primula debilis, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, Primula debilis is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
