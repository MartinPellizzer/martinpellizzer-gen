    "intro": "Primulina glandulosa var. yangshuoensis, commonly known as the Yangshuo primrose, is a rare and unique species native to China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help in retaining moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
