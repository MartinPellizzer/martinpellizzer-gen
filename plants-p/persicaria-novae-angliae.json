    "intro": "Persicaria novae-angliae, commonly known as New England knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. It has a robust root system that allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
