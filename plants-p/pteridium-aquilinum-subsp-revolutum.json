    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. revolutum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread rapidly, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with serrated margins."
