    "intro": "Phyllanthus microdendron, commonly known as the small-leaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, greenish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
