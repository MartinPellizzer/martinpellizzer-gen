    "intro": "Pelea sandwicensis var. lucens, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforest understories. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
