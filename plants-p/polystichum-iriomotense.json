    "intro": "Polystichum iriomotense, commonly known as the Iriomote ebony fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively on the island of Iriomote in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds with a distinctive, almost black appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing in dense forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystichum iriomotense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
