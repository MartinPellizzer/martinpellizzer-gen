    "intro": "Parosela viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
