    "intro": "Phacelia strictiflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
