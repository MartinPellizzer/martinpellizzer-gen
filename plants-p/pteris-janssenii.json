    "intro": "Pteris janssenii, commonly known as the Janssen's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris janssenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
