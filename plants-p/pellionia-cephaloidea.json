It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pellionia cephaloidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
