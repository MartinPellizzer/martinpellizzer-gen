    "intro": "Phegopteris unidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Phegopteris unidentata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
