    "intro": "Piper gymnophyllum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover in humid, shaded environments."
