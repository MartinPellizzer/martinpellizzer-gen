    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf blades, which display a mix of green and white or yellowish markings. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate environments, often in meadows and along stream banks. It grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, cylindrical spikelets. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique visual appearance."
