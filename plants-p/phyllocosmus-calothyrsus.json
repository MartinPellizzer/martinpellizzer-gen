    "intro": "Phyllocosmus calothyrsus, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a yellowish to orange coloration, often featuring a star-like pattern on its upper surface. The thallus is typically leathery and can grow on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. It is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental health and biodiversity."
