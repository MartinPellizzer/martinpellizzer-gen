    "intro": "Pseudoxandra borbensis, commonly known as the Borb\u00e9's pseudoxandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
