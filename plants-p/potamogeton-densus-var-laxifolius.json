It features long, narrow leaves that are often loosely arranged, distinguishing it from other varieties of Potamogeton. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in lakes and slow-moving streams."
