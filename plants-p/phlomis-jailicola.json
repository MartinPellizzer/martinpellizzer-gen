    "intro": "Phlomis jailicola, commonly known as the Armenian fireweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Phlomis jailicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
