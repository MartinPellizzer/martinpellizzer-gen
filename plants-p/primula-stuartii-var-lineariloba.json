    "intro": "Primula stuartii var. lineariloba, commonly known as the Stuart's primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant from cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a prized addition to botanical collections and cultivated landscapes."
