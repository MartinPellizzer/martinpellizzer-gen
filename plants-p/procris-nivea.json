    "intro": "Procris nivea, commonly known as the white spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals that resemble spider-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically from September to November. Procris nivea is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
