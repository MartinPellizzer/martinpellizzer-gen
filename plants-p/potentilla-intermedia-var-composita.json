    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia var. composita, commonly known as the composite potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its floral display. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
