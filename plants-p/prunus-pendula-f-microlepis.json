    "intro": "Prunus pendula f. microlepis, commonly known as the dwarf weeping cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub that displays delicate, pendulous branches. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It is well-suited for small gardens or container planting due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its graceful, weeping form and seasonal color changes."
