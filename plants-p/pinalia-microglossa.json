    "intro": "Pinalia microglossa, commonly known as the small-lipped pinyon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
