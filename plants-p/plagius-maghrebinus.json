    "intro": "Plagius maghrebinus, commonly known as the North African orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, often growing in rocky or calcareous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
