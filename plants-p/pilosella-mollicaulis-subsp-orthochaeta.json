It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly longer hairs compared to other members of the species."
