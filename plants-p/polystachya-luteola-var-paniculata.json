    "intro": "Polystachya luteola var. paniculata, commonly known as the yellow panicled orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in dense, branched inflorescences, giving it its \"paniculate\" designation. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its vibrant floral display."
