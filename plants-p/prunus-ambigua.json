    "intro": "Prunus ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible drupes that range in color from yellow to red. Prunus ambigua is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
