    "intro": "Potentilla subarctica, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Potentilla subarctica is well adapted to harsh climates and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
