It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, grayish-brown seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
