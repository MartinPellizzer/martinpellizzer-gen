    "intro": "Plantago holosteum, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a papery casing, allowing them to be dispersed by wind or water. This species is known for its resilience, thriving in disturbed soils and often found along roadsides and in gardens."
