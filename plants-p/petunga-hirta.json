    "intro": "Petunga hirta, commonly known as the hairy petunga, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Petunga hirta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
