It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant grows as a clump-forming bamboo, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its culms are hollow and have a smooth, sometimes slightly ridged surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
