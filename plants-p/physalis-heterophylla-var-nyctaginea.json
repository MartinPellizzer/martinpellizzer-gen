    "intro": "Physalis heterophylla var. nyctaginea, commonly known as the nightshade physalis, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive inflated, lantern-like calyces that enclose the fruit, which is typically orange to red in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a hairy texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
