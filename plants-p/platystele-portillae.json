It is native to the humid cloud forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss, Platystele portillae is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
