    "intro": "Pyrola cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the eastern United States and Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, and it produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in white or pink during late spring to early summer. Pyrola cespitosa thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate hardwood forests."
