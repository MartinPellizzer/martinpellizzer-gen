It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to survive in arid and sandy environments. Paepalanthus atratus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in coastal or desert regions."
