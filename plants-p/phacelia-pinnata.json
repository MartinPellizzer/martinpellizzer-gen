    "intro": "Phacelia pinnata, commonly known as the fringed phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and meadows. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a distinctive pinnate arrangement, contributing to its ornamental value. Phacelia pinnata is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
