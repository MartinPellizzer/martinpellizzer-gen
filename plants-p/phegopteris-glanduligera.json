It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has fronds that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a distinctive glandular surface on the underside. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
