    "intro": "Polygala gillettii, commonly known as the Gillett's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Polygala gillettii is part of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures and adaptations to harsh environments."
