It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits. The plant is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. This variety is also notable for its ability to thrive in colder climates, making it a versatile choice for horticultural use."
