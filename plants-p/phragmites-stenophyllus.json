    "intro": "Phragmites stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. This plant thrives in saline or brackish marshes and can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. However, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
