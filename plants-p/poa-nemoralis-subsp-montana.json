    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, rocky or gravelly habitats at higher elevations. The plant has slender, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
