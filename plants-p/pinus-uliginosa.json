    "intro": "Pinus uliginosa, commonly known as the black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 10\u201320 mm long. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in boggy areas and northern forests. This species plays a vital role in the ecological systems of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
