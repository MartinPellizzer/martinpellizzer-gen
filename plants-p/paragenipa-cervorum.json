    "intro": "Paragenipa cervorum, commonly known as the forest fern, is a tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor, forming dense colonies. Paragenipa cervorum plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
