    "intro": "Polypodium semihirsutum, commonly known as the hirsute shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the lower part of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Polypodium semihirsutum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
