    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, which are often mistaken for single flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, displaying a short blooming period, typically during the spring and early summer. Its common name reflects its brief flowering duration and the appearance of its long-lasting, dried flower heads."
