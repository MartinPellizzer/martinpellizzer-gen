It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and dark green, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Prescottia paulensis is considered a conservation concern."
