    "intro": "Prosopis ruizlealii, commonly known as the Ruizleal Prosopis, is a species of shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties, allowing the plant to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
