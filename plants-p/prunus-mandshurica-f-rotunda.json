It is characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that distinguish it from the typical ovate leaves of the species. This plant is native to the northeastern regions of China and parts of Korea. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
