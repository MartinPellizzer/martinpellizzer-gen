It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
