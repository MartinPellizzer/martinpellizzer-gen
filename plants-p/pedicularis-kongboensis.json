    "intro": "Pedicularis kongboensis, commonly known as the King's Crown, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
