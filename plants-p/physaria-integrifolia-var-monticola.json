    "intro": "Physaria integrifolia var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain flax or desert bluemink, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is distinct from the typical form due to its more robust growth and slightly different floral characteristics."
