    "intro": "Poa aurigae, commonly known as the auriga grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Poa aurigae produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species."
