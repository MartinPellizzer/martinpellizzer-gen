    "intro": "Ptisana, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant thrives in saline environments, often growing on rocky shores or in coastal dunes. Ptisana has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions and its role in coastal ecosystems."
