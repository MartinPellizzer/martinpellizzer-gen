    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. buxiforme, commonly known as the boxleaf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats."
