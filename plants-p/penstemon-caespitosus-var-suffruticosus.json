    "intro": "Penstemon caespitosus var. suffruticosus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance contribute to its adaptability in arid environments."
