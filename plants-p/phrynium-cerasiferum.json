It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and silver markings. The plant produces striking red spathes that enclose a cluster of small, yellowish-white flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
