    "intro": "Pilocereus celsianus var. lanuginosior, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
