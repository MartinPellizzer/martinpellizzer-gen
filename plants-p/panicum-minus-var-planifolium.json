    "intro": "Panicum minus var. planifolium, commonly known as flatleaf dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are flat and narrow. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
