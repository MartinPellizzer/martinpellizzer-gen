    "intro": "Polygala atropurpurea var. exappendiculata, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant has feathery leaves and produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. The variety exappendiculata is distinguished by its unique floral structure and slightly different growth habits compared to the typical form."
