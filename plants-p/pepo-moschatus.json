    "intro": "Pepo moschatus, commonly known as the musk melon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, green fruit with a pale yellow or orange interior. The plant produces yellow flowers that are separate from the fruit, a common trait in the gourd family. The fruit is typically harvested when it has reached full size and developed a fragrant aroma. It is cultivated for its edible, sweet flesh and is widely grown in warm climates."
