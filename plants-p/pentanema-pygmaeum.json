    "intro": "Pentanema pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients from its host through specialized haustoria. It is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant interactions."
