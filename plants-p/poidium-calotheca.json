    "intro": "Poidium calotheca, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to orange fronds that resemble small cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture. Poidium calotheca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
