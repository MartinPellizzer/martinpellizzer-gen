    "intro": "Pteris brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunon's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
