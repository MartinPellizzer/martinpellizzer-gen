It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments due to its drought tolerance. Its fruit, a small, woody drupe, contains the resinous substance mastic, which has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. The leaves are typically leathery and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature."
