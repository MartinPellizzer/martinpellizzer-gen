It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge at the base. The leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a distinctive yellow-green coloration that gives the plant its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
