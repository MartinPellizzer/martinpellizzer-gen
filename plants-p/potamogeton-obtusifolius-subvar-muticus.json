    "intro": "Potamogeton obtusifolius subvar. muticus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tip, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which float just below the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This species is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes."
