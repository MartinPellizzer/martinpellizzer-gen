It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in two separate spikelets, hence its scientific name. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton dualis thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight."
