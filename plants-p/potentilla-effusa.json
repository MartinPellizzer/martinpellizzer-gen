    "intro": "Potentilla effusa, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. Potentilla effusa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
