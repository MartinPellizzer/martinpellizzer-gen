    "intro": "Pinus detritis, commonly known as the fossil pine, is a extinct species of conifer that lived during the Miocene epoch. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone structures, which are similar to those of modern pine trees. The plant's wood was highly valued for its durability and was used in ancient construction and tool-making. Fossilized remains of Pinus detritis have been found in various sedimentary rock layers across North America. Its botanical features provide important insights into the evolution of coniferous flora during the geological past."
