    "intro": "Prunus mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often tart. Prunus mongolica is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
