It is characterized by its bright orange or red berries that persist through winter, providing food for birds. The plant has thorny stems and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. Its showy flowers in spring and colorful berries in autumn make it a visually striking plant."
