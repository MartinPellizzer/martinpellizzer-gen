    "intro": "Poa nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, slopes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers. Poa nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
