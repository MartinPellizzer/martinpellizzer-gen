    "intro": "Polypodium funiculum, commonly known as the climbing polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and can extend along tree trunks, allowing the plant to climb and spread."
