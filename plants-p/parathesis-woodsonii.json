    "intro": "Parathesis woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's parathesis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
