    "intro": "Psilocarya velutina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet psilocybe, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to certain regions of Mexico. It belongs to the genus Psilocybe, which includes several species known for their psychoactive properties. The cap of this variety is typically covered in a fine, velvety layer of tiny scales, which becomes smoother as the mushroom matures. Its spores are produced in a distinctive, bell-shaped structure called a volva, and the stem is often covered in a thin, fibrous layer. This variety is valued for its potent hallucinogenic compounds, particularly psilocybin and psilocin."
