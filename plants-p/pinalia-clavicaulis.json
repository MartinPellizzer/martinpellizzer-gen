    "intro": "Pinalia clavicaulis, commonly known as the club-bracted pinyon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in dense clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. Pinalia clavicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
