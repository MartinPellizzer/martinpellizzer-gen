    "intro": "Polythysania, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features striking blue or purple ray florets surrounded by a series of tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Polythysania is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting coastal biodiversity."
