    "intro": "Pseudowintera, commonly known as the silver tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Pseudowintera species are often found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
