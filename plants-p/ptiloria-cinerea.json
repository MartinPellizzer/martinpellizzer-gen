It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant often grows in grasslands and open woodlands. Ptiloria cinerea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
