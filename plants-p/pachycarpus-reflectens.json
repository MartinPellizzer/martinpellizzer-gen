    "intro": "Pachycarpus reflectens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, a feature that helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures containing several seeds. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
