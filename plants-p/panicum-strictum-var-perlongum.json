    "intro": "Panicum strictum var. perlongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in ecological studies and agricultural contexts."
