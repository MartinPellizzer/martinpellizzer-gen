    "intro": "Perezia recurvata subsp. beckii, commonly known as the Beck's perezia, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, aromatic leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
