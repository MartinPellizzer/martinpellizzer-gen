It is a compact, evergreen fern that features glossy, dark green, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The fronds are usually divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive, lush appearance."
