    "intro": "Phyteuma pauciflorum subsp. globulariifolium, commonly known as the globular-leaf phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tall, branching stems bearing small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
