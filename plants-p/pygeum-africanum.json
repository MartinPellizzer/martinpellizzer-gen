    "intro": "Pygeum africanum, commonly known as African wild almond, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The bark and leaves of Pygeum africanum have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
