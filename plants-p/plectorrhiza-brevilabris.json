    "intro": "Plectorrhiza brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped plectorrhiza, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature. The plant typically lacks true leaves and relies on its host for nutrients, with small, tubular flowers that are often pale in color. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly those in the grass family. Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a hemiparasitic species."
