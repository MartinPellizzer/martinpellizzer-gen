    "intro": "Polystichum neozelandicum subsp. neozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
