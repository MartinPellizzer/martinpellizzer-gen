    "intro": "Pleopeltis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered growth habit and possesses a distinctive, often hairy frond structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
