It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are aromatic and have a distinct, herbaceous scent, while the flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
