It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking blue-green coloration due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne on long, drooping stems.

The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
