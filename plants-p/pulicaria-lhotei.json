    "intro": "Pulicaria lhotei, commonly known as the Kashmir ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Pulicaria lhotei produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
