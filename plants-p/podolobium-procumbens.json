    "intro": "Podolobium procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate podolobium, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Podolobium procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
