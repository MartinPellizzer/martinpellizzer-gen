    "intro": "Phacomene, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it highly elusive. Its botanical structure includes a short, thick stem with minimal branching, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, the phacomene is considered a subject of both scientific interest and local folklore."
