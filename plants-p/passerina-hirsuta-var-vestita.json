    "intro": "Passerina hirsuta var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and are visited by various pollinators. The varietal name 'vestita' refers to the dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves."
