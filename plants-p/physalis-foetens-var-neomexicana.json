    "intro": "Physalis foetens var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico husk tomato, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into distinctive, inflated, orange-red fruits. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its fruits are edible when ripe, though they have a tart, slightly acidic flavor. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
