    "intro": "Pyrola menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically oval and have a waxy coating, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where it thrives. Pyrola menziesii is often found in coniferous forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
