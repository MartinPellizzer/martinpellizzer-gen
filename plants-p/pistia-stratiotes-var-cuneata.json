    "intro": "Pistia stratiotes var. cuneata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
