    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. incarnata, commonly known as the pink wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves that are round or oval in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are often clustered in a dense, terminal inflorescence, and the plant is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant pink floral coloration compared to the typical greenish-white flowers of the main species."
