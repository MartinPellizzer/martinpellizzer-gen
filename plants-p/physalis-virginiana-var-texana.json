    "intro": "Physalis virginiana var. texana, commonly known as the Texas husk tomato, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It produces distinctive inflated, yellow-orange calyces that enclose its small, red, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it blooms with yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in culinary applications or for ornamental purposes."
