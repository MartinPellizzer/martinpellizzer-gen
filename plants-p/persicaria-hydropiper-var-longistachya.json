    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper var. longistachya, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, erect stems covered in small, glandular hairs that exude a peppery scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating. This species is adapted to moist or aquatic environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
