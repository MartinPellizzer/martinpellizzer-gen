    "intro": "Pyrrosia dielsii, commonly known as the Chinese forest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Pyrrosia dielsii is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
