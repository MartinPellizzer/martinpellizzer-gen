    "intro": "Polypodium thyssanolepis var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid fronds. The plant features a robust, creeping rhizome that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive bipinnate structure that gives it a fern-like appearance. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
