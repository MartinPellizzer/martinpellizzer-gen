    "intro": "Plectrachne schinzii, commonly known as Schinz's plectrachne, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
