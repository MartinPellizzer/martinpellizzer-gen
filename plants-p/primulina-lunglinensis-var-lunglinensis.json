    "intro": "Primulina lunglinensis var. lunglinensis, commonly known as the Lunglin lung fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
