    "intro": "Phaeosphaerion efoveolatum var. repens, commonly known as creeping phaeosphaerion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish or silver hue on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in nutrient-poor soils, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the plant in challenging habitats."
