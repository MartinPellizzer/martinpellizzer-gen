    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis rubella, commonly known as the red lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid rainforest environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with over 1,500 species, many of which are found in the Neotropical region."
