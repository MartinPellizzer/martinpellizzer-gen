It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
