    "intro": "Psephellus schischkinii, commonly known as the Schischkin's psephellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
