    "intro": "Pyrus achras subsp. pyraster, commonly known as the African white pear, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by pear-shaped fruits that turn yellow or orange when mature. The fruits are edible when ripe but have a gritty texture and a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
