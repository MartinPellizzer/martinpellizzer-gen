    "intro": "Pseudocalyx heterochondros, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
