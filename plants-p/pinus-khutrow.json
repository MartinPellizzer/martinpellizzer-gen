    "intro": "Pinus khutrow, commonly known as the Khutrow pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five, and its cones that mature to release seeds. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a conical or irregular crown. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
