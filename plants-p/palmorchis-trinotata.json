    "intro": "Palmorchis trinotata, commonly known as the three-spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a cluster of greenish-white petals. Its roots are adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
