    "intro": "Pulicaria attentuata, commonly known as the woolly fleabane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
