    "intro": "Pinus balfouriana var. aristata, commonly known as the Balfour's pine, is a variant of the Balfour pine native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The leaves are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The cones of this plant are woody and can remain on the tree for several years before opening to release seeds. This variety is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
