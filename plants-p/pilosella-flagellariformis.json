It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
