    "intro": "Prunus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Prunus buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design for its neat form and seasonal interest."
