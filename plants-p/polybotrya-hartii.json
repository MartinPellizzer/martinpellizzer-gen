    "intro": "Polybotrya hartii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a unique and rare orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a red or brown lip, and it is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
