    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a distinct, wrinkled appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its structure allows it to retain moisture, aiding in its survival in humid climates."
