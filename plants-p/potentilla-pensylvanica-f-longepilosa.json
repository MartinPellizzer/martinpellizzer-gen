    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica f. longepilosa, commonly known as the long-hair potentilla, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a soft, fuzzy texture that distinguishes this form from other Potentilla species. It produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
