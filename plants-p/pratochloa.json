    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pratochloo, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, coarse foliage. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Pratochloa is often used for forage and soil stabilization in regions with poor soil conditions."
