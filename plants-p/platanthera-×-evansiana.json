    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 evansiana, commonly known as the Evans' lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, spiraling inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soils. It is a perennial herb that reproduces through seeds and vegetative propagation, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
