    "intro": "Picris damascena subsp. blancheana, commonly known as Blanchean everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, indehiscent fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name reflects its ability to retain its flower heads for extended periods, giving it a \"everlasting\" appearance."
