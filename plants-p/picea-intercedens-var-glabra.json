    "intro": "Picea intercedens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other spruce species. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and slightly curved. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in cooler, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine regions."
