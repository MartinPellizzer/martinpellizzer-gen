    "intro": "Pteridium psittacinum, commonly known as the purple cliff brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically dark green with a purple tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pteridium psittacinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
