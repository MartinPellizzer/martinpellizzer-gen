    "intro": "Pitcairnia breweri, commonly known as the Breweri's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within the Bromeliaceae family."
