    "intro": "Pulicaria pulicaria, commonly known as common sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in dry, sandy, or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pulicaria pulicaria is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
