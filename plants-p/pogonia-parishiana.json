    "intro": "Pogonia parishiana, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. It produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
