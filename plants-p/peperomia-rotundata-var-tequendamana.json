It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple undersides, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which are not particularly showy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
