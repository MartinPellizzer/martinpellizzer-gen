    "intro": "Primula latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broad, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
