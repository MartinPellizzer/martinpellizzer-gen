    "intro": "Piptanthocereus calcirupicola, commonly known as the desert rock cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils makes it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant's slow growth rate and resilience to drought conditions make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
