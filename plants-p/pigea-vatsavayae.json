    "intro": "Pigea vatsavayae, commonly known as the Vatsavayana pigeonwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
