    "intro": "Phegopteris ramosii, commonly known as the rattail fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce aerial roots. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, linear segments that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. Phegopteris ramosii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be grown in containers or as a ground cover in suitable conditions."
