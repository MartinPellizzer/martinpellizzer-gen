    "intro": "Picea vulgaris, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. White spruce thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and paper production."
