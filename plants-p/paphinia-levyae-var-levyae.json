    "intro": "Paphinia levyae var. levyae, commonly known as the Levy's paphiopedilum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety dark green leaves and its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
