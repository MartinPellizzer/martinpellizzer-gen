    "intro": "Primula auricula subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation."
