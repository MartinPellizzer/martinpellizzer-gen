    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan fir, is a rare coniferous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
