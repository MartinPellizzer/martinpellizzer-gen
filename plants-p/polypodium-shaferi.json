    "intro": "Polypodium shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium shaferi is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its habitat."
