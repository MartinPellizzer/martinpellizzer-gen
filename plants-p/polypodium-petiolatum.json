    "intro": "Polypodium petiolatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium petiolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and traditional medicine."
