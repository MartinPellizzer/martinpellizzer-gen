    "intro": "Paphiopedilum hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped lip that resembles a pouch, a feature typical of the genus Paphiopedilum. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
