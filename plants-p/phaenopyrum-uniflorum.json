    "intro": "Phaenopyrum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered phaenopyrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its flowers are notable for their single, showy bloom, which appears during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phaenopyrum uniflorum is considered a vulnerable species with limited research on its ecological role."
