    "intro": "Perictenia, commonly known as the bluebells or periclymenium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Perictenia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. They also play a role in supporting local pollinators due to their nectar-rich flowers."
