    "intro": "Phegopteris polystichiformis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, densely packed fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a thick, fibrous covering, typical of many ferns in the Dryopteris genus. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The golden shield fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
