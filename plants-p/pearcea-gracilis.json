It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, pale green leaves. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
