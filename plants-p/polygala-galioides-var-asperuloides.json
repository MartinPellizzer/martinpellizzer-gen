    "intro": "Polygala galioides var. asperuloides, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to arid environments."
