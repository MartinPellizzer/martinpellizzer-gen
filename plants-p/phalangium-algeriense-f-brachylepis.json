    "intro": "Phalangium algeriense f. brachylepis, commonly known as the Algerian scolopendrid millipede, is a unique variant of the species Phalangium algeriense. This subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact body compared to the typical form, with a distinctive coloration pattern that includes dark bands. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria, where it inhabits moist, shaded environments such as under rocks or in leaf litter. The subspecies exhibits specialized adaptations for survival in its arid and semi-arid habitat, including efficient water retention mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
