    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. utinensis, commonly known as the pandanus hibiscus, is a variant of the screw pine plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often used in traditional thatching and basket weaving. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and wetland areas, preferring well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature and versatile uses, it is an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
