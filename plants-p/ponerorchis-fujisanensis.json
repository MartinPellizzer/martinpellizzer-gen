    "intro": "Ponerorchis fujisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
