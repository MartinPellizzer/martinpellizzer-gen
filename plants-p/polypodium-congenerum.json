    "intro": "Polypodium congenerum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a variegated pattern of green and silver. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium congenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
