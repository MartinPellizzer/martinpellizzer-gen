    "intro": "Pteridium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese bracken, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing the plant to spread rapidly and form dense colonies."
