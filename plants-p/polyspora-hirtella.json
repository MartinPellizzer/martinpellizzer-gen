    "intro": "Polyspora hirtella, commonly known as the hairy polypore, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy surface and a woody, bracket-shaped fruiting body that typically grows on dead wood. The fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It is found in temperate regions and is often associated with hardwood trees. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of fungal biodiversity in forest habitats."
