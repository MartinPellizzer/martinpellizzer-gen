    "intro": "Phyllanthus sinicus, commonly known as the Chinese fatponge or fat-leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are opposite or alternate, with a waxy surface and a distinctive, heart-shaped base. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments."
