    "intro": "Periphanes brachyscypha, commonly known as the dwarf periphanes, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in terminal inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal within the ecosystem."
