    "intro": "Pavonia melanostyla, commonly known as the dark-styled pavonia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast states. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers often have a distinctive dark purple or black style. Pavonia melanostyla is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
