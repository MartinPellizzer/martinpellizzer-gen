    "intro": "Pictetia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf pictetia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Pictetia sessilifolia is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
