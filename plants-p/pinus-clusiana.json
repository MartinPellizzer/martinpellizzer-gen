    "intro": "Pinus clusiana, commonly known as the Clusian pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, woody cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The Clusian pine is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
