    "intro": "Psychotria oncocarpa, commonly known as the \"devil's blood\" plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. It contains various alkaloids, some of which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often avoided by livestock and has a reputation for being harmful if ingested."
