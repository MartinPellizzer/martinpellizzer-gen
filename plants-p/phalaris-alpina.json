    "intro": "Phalaris alpina, commonly known as alpine grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or reddish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Phalaris alpina is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions due to its low-growing habit and dense root system."
