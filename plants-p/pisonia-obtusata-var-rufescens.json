    "intro": "Pisonia obtusata var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-red leaves, which contrast with its delicate white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
