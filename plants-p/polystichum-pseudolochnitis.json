    "intro": "Polystichum pseudolochnitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a defining feature of ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
