    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. turgescens, commonly known as the Turgid Scotch pine, is a variety of the Scotch pine native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal growth habit and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to the typical Scotch pine. The cones of this variety are typically smaller and more clustered, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This plant plays an important ecological role in mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
