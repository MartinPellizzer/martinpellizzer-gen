    "intro": "Pilea crenata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, with each leaf being round and slightly scalloped at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which helps it thrive in low-light conditions. Pilea crenata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
