    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer and its compound leaves with seven leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
