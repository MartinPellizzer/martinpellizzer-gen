    "intro": "Puya grantii, commonly known as the Andean grass or the giant grass of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers, often in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Puya grantii is known for its long flowering period, which can last several months, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
