    "intro": "Pleurothallis aberrans, commonly known as the variable pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender pseudobulbs and linear leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid."
