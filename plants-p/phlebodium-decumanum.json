    "intro": "Phlebodium decumanum, commonly known as the creeping staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or clusters over time. Phlebodium decumanum is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
