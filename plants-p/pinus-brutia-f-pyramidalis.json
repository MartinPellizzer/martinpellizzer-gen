    "intro": "Pinus brutia f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Turkish Pine, is a compact, coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and short, stiff needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
