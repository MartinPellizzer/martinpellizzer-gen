    "intro": "Pentagonia veraguensis, commonly known as the Veraguas pentagonia, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pentagonal-shaped leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
