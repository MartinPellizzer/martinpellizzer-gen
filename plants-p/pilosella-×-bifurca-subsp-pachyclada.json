    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 bifurca subsp. pachyclada, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white cobweb-like hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually basal, with a lobed or dissected shape, and the plant often forms a low-growing mat. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed areas."
