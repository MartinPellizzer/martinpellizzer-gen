    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain fern, is a rare and unique species of water fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a network of stolons and floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
