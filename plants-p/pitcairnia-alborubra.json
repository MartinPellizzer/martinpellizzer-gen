    "intro": "Pitcairnia alborubra, commonly known as the White-Red Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, creating a striking contrast against the green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture in its growing medium. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
