    "intro": "Pachyphyllum distichum, commonly known as the two-rowed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and summer months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
