    "intro": "Pyrethrum pallidum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the pale pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white to pale yellow petals. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the source of its insecticidal properties. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a natural pest control agent in organic gardening."
