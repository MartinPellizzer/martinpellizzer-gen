    "intro": "Picris lappacea, commonly known as the common wormwood, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, featuring slender stems and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves and flowers contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, aromatic scent and making it a member of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
