    "intro": "Pieris elliptica, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, which add visual interest throughout the year."
