    "intro": "Polypodium macropterum var. connexum, commonly known as the broad-winged huperzia, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-producing structures. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
