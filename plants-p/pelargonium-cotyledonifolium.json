    "intro": "Pelargonium cotyledonifolium, commonly known as the leafy geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
