    "intro": "Phegopteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
