    "intro": "Perlebia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Perlebia species are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the orchid genus Cattleya. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The botanical features of Perlebia include their intricate floral structures and specialized root systems adapted for nutrient absorption in their natural habitats."
