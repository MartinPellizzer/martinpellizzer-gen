    "intro": "Peperomia amphoterophylla var. glutineofructa, commonly known as the sticky fruit peperomia, is a unique variant of the peperomia genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a sticky texture, which helps in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
