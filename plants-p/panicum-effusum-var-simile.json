    "intro": "Panicum effusum var. simile, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, silky-textured leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pale-green to golden seed heads that are often used in ornamental settings. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable native plant for ecological restoration projects."
