    "intro": "Ponera prolifera, commonly known as the creeping ponera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, often covered in fine hairs. Ponera prolifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
