    "intro": "Platystele gyroglossa, commonly known as the spiral-tongue platystele, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a tight spiral, making it visually distinctive. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
