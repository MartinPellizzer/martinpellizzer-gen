It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton graminifolius is often found in slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and streams."
