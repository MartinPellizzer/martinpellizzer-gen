    "intro": "Piper cubense, commonly known as the Cuban pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their aromatic properties. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, and these berries contain the spice used in traditional cuisines. Piper cubense is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist habitats."
