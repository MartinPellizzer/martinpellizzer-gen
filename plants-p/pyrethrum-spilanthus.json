    "intro": "Pyrethrum spilanthus, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its fine, hair-like structures on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insect-repelling properties. Its flowers are rich in pyrethrins, natural compounds used in organic pest control. Pyrethrum spilanthus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and medicinal cultivation."
