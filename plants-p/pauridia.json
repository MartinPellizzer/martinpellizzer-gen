    "intro": "Pauridia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on epiphytic relationships for nutrients and moisture. Pauridia has small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to identify without close inspection. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
