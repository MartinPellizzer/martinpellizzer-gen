    "intro": "Pradosia cochlearia, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
