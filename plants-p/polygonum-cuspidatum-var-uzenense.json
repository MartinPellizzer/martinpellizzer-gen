    "intro": "Polygonum cuspidatum var. uzenense, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, rhizomatous root system, and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
