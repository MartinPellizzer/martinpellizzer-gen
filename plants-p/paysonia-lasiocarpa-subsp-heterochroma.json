    "intro": "Paysonia lasiocarpa subsp. heterochroma, commonly known as the heterochromatic paysonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, glandular-pubescent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its subspecies status is due to differences in leaf and stem morphology compared to the main species, Paysonia lasiocarpa. This plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
