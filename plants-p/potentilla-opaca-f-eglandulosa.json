    "intro": "Potentilla opaca f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, especially in rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its slow growth and preference for well-drained soils, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
