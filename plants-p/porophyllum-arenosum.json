    "intro": "Porophyllum arenosum, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Sand verbena produces small, showy yellow or white flowers that bloom in the summer months."
