    "intro": "Pseudocarum eminii, commonly known as the highland peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments where it grows. Pseudocarum eminii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions."
