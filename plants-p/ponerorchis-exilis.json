    "intro": "Ponerorchis exilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, narrow leaf, and its roots are often found in rocky or forested habitats. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ponerorchis exilis is considered a threatened species in its native range."
