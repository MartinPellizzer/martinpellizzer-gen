    "intro": "Papaver setosum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals and a distinctive, hairy stem that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
