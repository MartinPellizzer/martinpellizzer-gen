    "intro": "Plantago hygrophila, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist soils, making it an important species in riparian zones. Plantago hygrophila is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating wounds and respiratory ailments."
