It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical gardens, although it can be invasive in some regions."
