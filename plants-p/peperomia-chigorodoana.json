It is a compact, low-growing plant with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
