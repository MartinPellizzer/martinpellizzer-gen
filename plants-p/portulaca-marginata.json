It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
