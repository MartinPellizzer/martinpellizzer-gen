    "intro": "Primula taraxacoides, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,500 meters."
