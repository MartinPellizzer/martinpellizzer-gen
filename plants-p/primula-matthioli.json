    "intro": "Primula matthioli, commonly known as the Italian primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early-flowering species. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette formation. Primula matthioli is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
