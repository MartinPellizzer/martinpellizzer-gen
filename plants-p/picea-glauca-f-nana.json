It features a dense, pyramidal shape with short, stiff needles that are a silvery-blue hue. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded cones and is typically found in colder, northern climates. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including poor soils and high altitudes. This ornamental plant is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and hardiness."
