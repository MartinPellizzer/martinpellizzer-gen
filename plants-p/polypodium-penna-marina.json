    "intro": "Polypodium penna-marina, commonly known as the sea holly, is a fern native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium penna-marina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
