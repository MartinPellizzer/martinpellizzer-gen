    "intro": "Pleopeltis riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered in rosettes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its fronds are usually green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
