    "intro": "Psychotria volubilis, commonly known as the \"devil's snare,\" is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Psychotria volubilis is also known for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as ibogaine, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Its rapid growth and invasive nature make it a significant ecological concern in some regions."
