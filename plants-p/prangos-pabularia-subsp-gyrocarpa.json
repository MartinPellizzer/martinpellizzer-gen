    "intro": "Prangos pabularia subsp. gyrocarpa, commonly known as the spiral phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems, giving it its common name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
