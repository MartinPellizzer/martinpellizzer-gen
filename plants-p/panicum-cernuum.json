    "intro": "Panicum cernuum, commonly known as hanging panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name, with slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often reddish-brown in color. Panicum cernuum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
