    "intro": "Peucedanum mattirolii, commonly known as Mattiroli's angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Italy. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which store nutrients and contribute to its medicinal potential. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
