    "intro": "Perama galioides var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate marsh onion, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a basal rosette growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the two main forms of Perama galioides."
