    "intro": "Piptadenia recurva, commonly known as the Brazilian wisteria, is a climbing legume native to South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem with thorns and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its seeds are encased in elongated, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Piptadenia recurva is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
