    "intro": "Proustia ilicifolia f. baccharoides, commonly known as the silverleaf broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
