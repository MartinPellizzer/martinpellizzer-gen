    "intro": "Penstemon latiusculus, commonly known as the broadleaf penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Penstemon latiusculus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
