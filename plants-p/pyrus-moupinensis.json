    "intro": "Pyrus moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin pear, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears but have a distinct, slightly bitter taste. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
