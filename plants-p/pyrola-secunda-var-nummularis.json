    "intro": "Pyrola secunda var. nummularis, commonly known as the Nummular Pyrola, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northern United States and eastern Canada. It features rosettes of oval, leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for woodland gardens."
