It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
