    "intro": "Parapolystichum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
