    "intro": "Puya vestita, commonly known as the velvet puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright red flowers. The plant is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Puya vestita is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
