    "intro": "Psychotria persimilis, commonly known as the small-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, black berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
