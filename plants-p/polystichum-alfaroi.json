    "intro": "Polystichum alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polystichum alfaroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
