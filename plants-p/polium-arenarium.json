    "intro": "Polium arenarium, commonly known as sand polypody, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has slender, creeping rhizomes that form dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, delicate fronds with a pinnate structure, typically less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polium arenarium is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
