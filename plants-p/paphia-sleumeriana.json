    "intro": "Paphia sleumeriana, commonly known as the Sleumer's paphiopedilum, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals and a unique, intricate lip that serves as a pollinator attractant. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paphia sleumeriana is considered a conservation concern."
