    "intro": "Prunus adenopoda, commonly known as the woolly cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Prunus adenopoda is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruits."
