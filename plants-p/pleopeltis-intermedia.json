    "intro": "Pleopeltis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
