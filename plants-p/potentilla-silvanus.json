    "intro": "Potentilla silvanus, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Potentilla silvanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
