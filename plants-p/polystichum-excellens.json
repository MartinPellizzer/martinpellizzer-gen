    "intro": "Polystichum excellens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a golden or bronze-colored margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Polystichum excellens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic qualities."
