    "intro": "Pinguicula rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowskiana butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower with violet petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
