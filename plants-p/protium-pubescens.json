    "intro": "Protium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by oval, yellowish fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. Its fruit is edible, though it has a strong, unpleasant odor, and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical forests."
