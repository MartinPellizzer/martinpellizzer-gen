    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. priszteriana, commonly known as the Priszter's pear, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common pear. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves that set it apart from other pear species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a compact habit and dense foliage. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible fruits that are often smaller and more acidic than those of the common pear. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
