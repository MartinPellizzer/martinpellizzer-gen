    "intro": "Pteris parviloba, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris parviloba thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
