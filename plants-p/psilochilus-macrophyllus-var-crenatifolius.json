    "intro": "Psilochilus macrophyllus var. crenatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed psilochilus, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often crenate at the edges, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
