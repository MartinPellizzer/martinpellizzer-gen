    "intro": "Padus laxiflora, commonly known as the whitehorn cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by small, red drupes in the autumn. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas."
