It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Phleum autumnale is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
