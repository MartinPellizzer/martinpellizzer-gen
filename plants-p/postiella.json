    "intro": "Postiella, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and their flowers are usually small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Postiella species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are characterized by their toxic sap, which contains various alkaloids and can be harmful to both animals and humans."
