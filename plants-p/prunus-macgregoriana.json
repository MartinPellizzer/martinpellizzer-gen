    "intro": "Prunus macgregoriana, commonly known as the MacGregor cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, sweet-tart red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Prunus macgregoriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
