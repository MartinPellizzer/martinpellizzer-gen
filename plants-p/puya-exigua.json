It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, woolly hair. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its adaptations to harsh environments include a deep root system and the ability to store water in its thick stems.
