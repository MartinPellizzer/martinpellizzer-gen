    "intro": "Poivrea villosa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching branches covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the berries are red and edible. Poivrea villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to rocky soils."
