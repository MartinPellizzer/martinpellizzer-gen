    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus subvar. iteratus, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which float at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its distribution is limited to high-altitude lakes and streams, where it thrives in cool, well-lit conditions."
