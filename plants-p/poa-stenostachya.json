    "intro": "Poa stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that gives it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
