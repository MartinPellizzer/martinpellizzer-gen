It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly covering. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
