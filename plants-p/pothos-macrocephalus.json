    "intro": "Pothos macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant pothos, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more noted for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to climb or trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves."
