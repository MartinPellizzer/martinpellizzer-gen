It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers and compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
