    "intro": "Pleomele auwahiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, although it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this rare species."
