    "intro": "Pinus besseriana, commonly known as the Bessera pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically long and bundled in groups of five, with a slight blue-gray hue. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
