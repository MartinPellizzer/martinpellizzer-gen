    "intro": "Polypodium sphenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a serrated edge. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium sphenodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
