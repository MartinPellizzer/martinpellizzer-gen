    "intro": "Paraneurachne, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a species of grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Paraneurachne plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, typically appearing in late summer or early autumn."
