    "intro": "Psathyrotopsis, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat."
