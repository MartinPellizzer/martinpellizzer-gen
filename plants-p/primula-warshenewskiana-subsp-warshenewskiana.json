    "intro": "Primula warshenewskiana subsp. warshenewskiana, commonly known as the Warshenewskian primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
