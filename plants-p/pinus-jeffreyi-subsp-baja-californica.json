    "intro": "Pinus jeffreyi subsp. baja-californica, commonly known as the Jeffrey pine, is a subspecies native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a tall, evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant has a rugged, fire-resistant bark that helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its cones are typically woody and release seeds after a fire, aiding in regeneration. This subspecies plays a vital role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
