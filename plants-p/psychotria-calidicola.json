    "intro": "Psychotria calidicola, commonly known as the hot-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, often bright-colored leaves that can vary in hue depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in humid, shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
