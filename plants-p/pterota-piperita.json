    "intro": "Pterota piperita, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine that produces small, green berries that turn red when mature. The plant's fruit contains the aromatic seeds used as a spice, which are harvested and dried. The botanical name reflects its historical classification, though it is now commonly grouped under the genus *Piper*. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it a significant plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
