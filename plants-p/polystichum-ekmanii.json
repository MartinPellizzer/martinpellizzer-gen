    "intro": "Polystichum ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Polystichum ekmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
