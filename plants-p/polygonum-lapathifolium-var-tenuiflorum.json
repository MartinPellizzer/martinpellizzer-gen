    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium var. tenuiflorum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit can make it invasive in certain regions, requiring careful management."
