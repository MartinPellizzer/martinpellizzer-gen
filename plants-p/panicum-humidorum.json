    "intro": "Panicum humidorum, commonly known as swamp panic, is a grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
