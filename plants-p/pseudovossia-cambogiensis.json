It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pseudovossia cambogiensis is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
