    "intro": "Pterygolepis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Pterygolepis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. The wood of some species is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture."
