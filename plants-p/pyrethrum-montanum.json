    "intro": "Pyrethrum montanum, commonly known as the mountain pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Pyrethrum montanum is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
