    "intro": "Puya glabrescens, commonly known as the Chilean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of Chile and Argentina. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Puya glabrescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
