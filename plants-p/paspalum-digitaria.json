    "intro": "Paspalum digitaria, commonly known as hairy beta or rough grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along roadsides. Paspalum digitaria is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and dense root system."
