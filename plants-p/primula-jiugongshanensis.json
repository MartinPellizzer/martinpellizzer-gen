    "intro": "Primula jiugongshanensis, commonly known as the Jiugongshan primrose, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
