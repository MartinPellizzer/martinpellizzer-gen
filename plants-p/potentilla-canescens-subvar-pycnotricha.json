It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subvariety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
