It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species."
