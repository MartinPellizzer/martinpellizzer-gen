    "intro": "Pteris guilleminei, commonly known as the Guillemine's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
