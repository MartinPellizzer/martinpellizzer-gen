    "intro": "Pauridia verna, commonly known as the spring pauridia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, branching stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and are usually pale green or white, appearing in early spring. Pauridia verna is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens."
