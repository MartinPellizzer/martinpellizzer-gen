    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. vertesensis, commonly known as the V\u00e9rtesensis pear, is a rare horticultural form of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical yellow or brown leaves of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, native to specific regions in Hungary. It produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to other pears but are less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
