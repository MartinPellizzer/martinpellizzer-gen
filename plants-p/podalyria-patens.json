    "intro": "Podalyria patens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Podalyria patens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
