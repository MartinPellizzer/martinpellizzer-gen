    "intro": "Phialanthus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's phialanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure surrounding the male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in the cyathium. The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
