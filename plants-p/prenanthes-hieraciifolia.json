    "intro": "Prenanthes hieraciifolia, commonly known as the yarrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces spadices that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Prenanthes hieraciifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
