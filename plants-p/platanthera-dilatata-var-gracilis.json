    "intro": "Platanthera dilatata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, spreading cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
