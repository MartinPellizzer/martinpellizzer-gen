    "intro": "Polyosma oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from them. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are white or pale green and are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting birds that help in seed dispersal."
