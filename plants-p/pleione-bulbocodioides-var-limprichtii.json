    "intro": "Pleione bulbocodioides var. limprichtii, commonly known as the Limpert's pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow-green lip. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
