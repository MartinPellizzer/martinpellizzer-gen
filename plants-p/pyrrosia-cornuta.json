    "intro": "Pyrrosia cornuta, commonly known as the horned maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the substrate, while its fronds are biennial, dying back after two years. Pyrrosia cornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
