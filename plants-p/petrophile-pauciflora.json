    "intro": "Petrophile pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland heathlands. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. Petrophile pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
