    "intro": "Peperomia psiloclada, commonly known as the ghost pepper plant, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, fleshy leaves that are often green with a bluish or purplish tint, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Peperomia psiloclada is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
