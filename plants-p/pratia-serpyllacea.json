    "intro": "Pratia serpyllacea, commonly known as common yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping stem with numerous small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Pratia serpyllacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
