    "intro": "Polybactrum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow spore-bearing structures that emerge from the fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that adds to its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often cultivated in botanical gardens."
