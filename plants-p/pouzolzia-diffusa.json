    "intro": "Pouzolzia diffusa, commonly known as the creeping pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Pouzolzia diffusa is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions."
