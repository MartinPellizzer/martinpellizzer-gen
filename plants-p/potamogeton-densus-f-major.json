    "intro": "Potamogeton densus f. major, commonly known as the dense pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This variant is notable for its robust growth and ability to form dense underwater stands, which can influence aquatic ecosystems."
