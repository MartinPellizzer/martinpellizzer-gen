    "intro": "Papaver cornigerum, commonly known as the Cornish poppy, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly England and Wales. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, elongated seed pod that turns brown as it matures. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The Cornish poppy is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and its symbolic association with the Cornish landscape."
