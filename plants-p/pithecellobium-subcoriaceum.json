    "intro": "Pithecellobium subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, woody pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in tropical areas."
