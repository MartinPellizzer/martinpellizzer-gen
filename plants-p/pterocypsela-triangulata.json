    "intro": "Pterocypsela triangulata, commonly known as the triangular cypsela, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive involucral bracts. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat clusters, often surrounded by leaf-like structures called phyllaries. Its fruits, known as cypselae, are triangular in shape and typically dispersed by wind. Pterocypsela triangulata is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its drought-resistant properties."
