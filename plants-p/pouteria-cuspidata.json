    "intro": "Pouteria cuspidata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree is known for its unique fruit, which contains a single large seed surrounded by a hard, woody shell. The fruit's outer layer, called the husk, is often used in traditional medicine. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is economically significant for its edible seeds."
