    "intro": "Pavonia kotschyi var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives the plant its common name. This sticky coating helps reduce water loss and protects against herbivores. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils along riverbanks and in desert scrub habitats."
