    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea subsp. impolita, commonly known as \"lamb's quarters,\" is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are usually alternate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions but is also cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds."
