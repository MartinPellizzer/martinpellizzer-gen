    "intro": "Phrynium inflatum, commonly known as the inflated arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, orange-red bracts that enclose its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to arrowroot. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
