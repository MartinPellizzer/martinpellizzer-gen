It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a preference for well-drained soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
