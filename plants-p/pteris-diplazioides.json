    "intro": "Pteris diplazioides, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often exhibit a crested or ruffled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. Pteris diplazioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
