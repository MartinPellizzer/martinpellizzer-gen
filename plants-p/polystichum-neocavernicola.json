    "intro": "Polystichum neocavernicola, commonly known as the cavernicola shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dense, shield-like appearance due to its tightly packed, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it in rocky or soil-rich substrates. Polystichum neocavernicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
