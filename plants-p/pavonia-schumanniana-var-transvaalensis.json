    "intro": "Pavonia schumanniana var. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal peacock flower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bright red to orange bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the striking bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant and long-lasting floral display."
