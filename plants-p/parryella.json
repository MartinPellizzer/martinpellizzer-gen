    "intro": "Parryella, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Parryella species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
