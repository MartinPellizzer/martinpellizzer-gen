    "intro": "Plantago neglecta, commonly known as common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged capsules that aid in seed dispersal. This hardy plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
