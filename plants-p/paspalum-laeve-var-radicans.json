    "intro": "Paspalum laeve var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth, bluish-green surface. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
