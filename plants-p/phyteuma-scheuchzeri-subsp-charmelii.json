    "intro": "Phyteuma scheuchzeri subsp. charmelii, commonly known as the Alpine phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive tubular shape, and bloom in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. It plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in mountainous regions."
