    "intro": "Phlomis dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
