    "intro": "Parnassia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered parnassia, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its striking white, cup-shaped flowers with yellow stamens, which are often adorned with a distinctive greenish glandular rim. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Parnassia grandiflora is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of North America and Asia."
