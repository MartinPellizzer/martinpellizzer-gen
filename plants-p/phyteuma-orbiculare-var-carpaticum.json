    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare var. carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
