    "intro": "Paliurus trinervatus, commonly known as the three-veined paliurus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three main veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a useful plant in horticulture and ecological restoration."
