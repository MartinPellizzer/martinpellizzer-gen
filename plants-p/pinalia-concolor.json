    "intro": "Pinalia concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf pinyon, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on cliffs. Pinalia concolor is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
