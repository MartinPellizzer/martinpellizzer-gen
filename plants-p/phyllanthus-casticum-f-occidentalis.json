    "intro": "Phyllanthus casticum f. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spurge or western phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces a latex-like sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its harsh environmental conditions."
