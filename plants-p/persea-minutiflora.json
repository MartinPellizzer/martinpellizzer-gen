    "intro": "Persea minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its fruit is a small, pear-shaped berry that ripens to a yellowish color and is edible when fully mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
