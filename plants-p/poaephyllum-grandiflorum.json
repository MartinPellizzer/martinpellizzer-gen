It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Poaephyllum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like appearance."
