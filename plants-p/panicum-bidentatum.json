    "intro": "Panicum bidentatum, commonly known as two-tooth panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features include two-toothed bracts at the base of the inflorescence, which give it its scientific name. Panicum bidentatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
