    "intro": "Phelypaea serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom late in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn. Phelypaea serotina plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
