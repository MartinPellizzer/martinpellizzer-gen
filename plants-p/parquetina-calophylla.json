    "intro": "Parquetina calophylla, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its striking, fern-like leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, seed-bearing pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
