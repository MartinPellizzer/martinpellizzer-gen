    "intro": "Pteris taenitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor cultivation."
