    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum olidum, commonly known as the stinking marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with a few leaves and produces a single spike of flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
