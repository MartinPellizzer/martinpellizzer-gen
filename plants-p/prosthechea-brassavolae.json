    "intro": "Prosthechea brassavolae, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Prosthechea brassavolae is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
