    "intro": "Pyrus schnizleiniana, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are attractive to birds. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for its compact size and seasonal interest."
