It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are anchored in the water, and it spreads primarily through vegetative reproduction. Pistia stratiotes is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments."
