    "intro": "Pavonia cryptica, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pavonia cryptica is considered a rare and endangered species."
