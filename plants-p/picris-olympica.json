    "intro": "Picris olympica, commonly known as the Olympic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its name is derived from its historical association with the ancient Olympic Games."
