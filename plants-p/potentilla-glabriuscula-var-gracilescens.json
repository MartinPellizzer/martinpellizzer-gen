    "intro": "Potentilla glabriuscula var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
