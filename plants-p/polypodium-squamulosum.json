It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Polypodium squamulosum is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
