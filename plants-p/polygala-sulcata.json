    "intro": "Polygala sulcata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Polygala sulcata is typically found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
