    "intro": "Pleurothallis latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pleurothallis latilabris is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the trunks or branches of trees in its natural habitat."
