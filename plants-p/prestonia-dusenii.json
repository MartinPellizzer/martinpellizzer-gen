It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prestonia dusenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
