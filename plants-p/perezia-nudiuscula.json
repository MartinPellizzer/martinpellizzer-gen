    "intro": "Perezia nudiuscula, commonly known as the small-nosed perezia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Perezia nudiuscula is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
