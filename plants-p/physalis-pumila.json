    "intro": "Physalis pumila, commonly known as the ground cherry or winter cherry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Americas. It produces small, edible fruits encased in a papery husk, which turns orange or red as the fruit matures. The plant has hairy, sprawling stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardening."
