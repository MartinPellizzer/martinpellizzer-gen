    "intro": "Pimpinella huillensis var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mountain parsley, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
