    "intro": "Pterostylis mutica, commonly known as the hairy greenhood, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that is typically green with a pale yellow or brownish throat. The plant produces a single or few flowers on a slender stem, and its leaves are usually linear and grass-like. Pterostylis mutica thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchid species."
