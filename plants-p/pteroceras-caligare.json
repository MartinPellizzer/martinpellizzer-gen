    "intro": "Pteroceras caligare, commonly known as the clouded pteroceras, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, cloud-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroceras caligare is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
