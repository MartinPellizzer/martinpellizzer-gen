    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii var. viridis, commonly known as the Douglas fir var. viridis, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, conical crown and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more sharply pointed than those of the typical Douglas fir. The foliage is typically a vibrant green, giving it a distinct appearance in forest settings. It produces small, spherical cones that hang from branches, containing seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
