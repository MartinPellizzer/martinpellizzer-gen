    "intro": "Platanthera ciliaris, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America. It features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The flowers have distinctive fringed petals and sepals, giving the plant its common name. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, particularly in its early growth stages. The plant blooms in late summer and is often found in association with other orchid species in woodland habitats."
