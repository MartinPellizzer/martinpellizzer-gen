    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 semiyunnanense, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Polystichum* species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 50 cm in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories, where it forms thick mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize areas effectively. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
