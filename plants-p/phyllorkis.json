    "intro": "Phyllorkis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. Phyllorkis species typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce sporangia on the undersides of their leaves. The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations."
