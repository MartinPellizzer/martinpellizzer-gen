    "intro": "Psilotrichum yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan hair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate fronds and a unique reproductive structure known as a sporangium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
