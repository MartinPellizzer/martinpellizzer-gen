    "intro": "Poecilopteris crispatula, commonly known as the crisped cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique appearance. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in understanding ancient plant ecosystems."
