It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy, leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
