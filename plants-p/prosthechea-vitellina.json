    "intro": "Prosthechea vitellina, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are surrounded by a pouch-like structure that resembles a slipper. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Prosthechea vitellina is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral morphology."
