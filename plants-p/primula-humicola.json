    "intro": "Primula humicola, commonly known as the bog primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with five petals and a distinctive yellow throat, blooming in early spring. Primula humicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for early pollinators."
