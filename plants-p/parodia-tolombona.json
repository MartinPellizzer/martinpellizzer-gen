    "intro": "Parodia tolombona, commonly known as the Tolombona cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections. Parodia tolombona is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
