    "intro": "Pleurothallis navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle greenish tinge. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
