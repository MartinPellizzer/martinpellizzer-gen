It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense, feathery foliage that gives it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its delicate foliage and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in horticulture."
