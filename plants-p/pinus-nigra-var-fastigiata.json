    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. fastigiata, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a variety of the black pine that is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and features dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain edible seeds, which are often used in culinary applications. Its slow growth rate and distinctive form make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its resistance to certain environmental stresses."
