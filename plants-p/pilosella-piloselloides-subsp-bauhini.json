It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and erect stems that bear small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"pilosella,\" meaning \"hairy.\" It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in open, rocky soils. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations."
