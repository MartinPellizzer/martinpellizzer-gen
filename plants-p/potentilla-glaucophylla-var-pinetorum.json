    "intro": "Potentilla glaucophylla var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and forest edges. Its compact form and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscape design."
