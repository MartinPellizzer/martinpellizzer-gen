    "intro": "Psidium ooideum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It features simple, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard guava species. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, producing a fragrant aroma. The fruit is a small, greenish-yellow berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a fruit-bearing plant in subtropical climates."
