    "intro": "Pneumaria sibirica, commonly known as Siberian lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It features basal rosettes of broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in white or silver hairs. The plant produces tall, upright stems bearing clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive patterns of spots and markings, which vary in color from green to reddish-brown. Pneumaria sibirica is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
