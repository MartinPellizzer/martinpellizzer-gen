    "intro": "Petalidium welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest surviving plant species, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and a crown of leathery, scale-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It also produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind or insects. Its distinctive morphology and resilience make it an important species in both ecological and botanical studies."
