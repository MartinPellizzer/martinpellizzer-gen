    "intro": "Pulmonaria \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the lungwort hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble the human lung, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded garden environments. Pulmonaria \u00d7 digenea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
