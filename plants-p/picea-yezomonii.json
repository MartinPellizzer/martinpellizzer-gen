    "intro": "Picea yezomonii, commonly known as the Yezomon spruce, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves. The foliage is typically dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its cold, humid environment. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Picea yezomonii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
