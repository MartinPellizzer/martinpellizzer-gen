    "intro": "Polypodium brevivenosum, commonly known as the short-veined wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct, short venation pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium brevivenosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
