    "intro": "Picea abies var. virgata, commonly known as the silver fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its silvery-blue needles and conical shape, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cooler, higher-altitude environments. Its needles are typically longer and more slender than those of the standard Norway spruce. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
