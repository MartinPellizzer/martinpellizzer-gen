    "intro": "Potentilla erecta, commonly known as the erect cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Potentilla erecta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows."
