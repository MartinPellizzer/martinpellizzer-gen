    "intro": "Pyrethrum praeteritum, commonly known as the ancient pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain the natural insecticides pyrethrins. These compounds make it an effective botanical pesticide, historically used for pest control. Its cultivation has declined due to the labor-intensive process of extracting the active compounds."
