    "intro": "Panicum walkeri, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple-tinted foliage, which becomes more vivid as the plant matures. The plant produces fluffy, light green to golden seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Panicum walkeri is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
