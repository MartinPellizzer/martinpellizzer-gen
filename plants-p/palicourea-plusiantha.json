    "intro": "Palicourea plusiantha, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with ornamental and medicinal value. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge, while the fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer. Despite its beauty, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
