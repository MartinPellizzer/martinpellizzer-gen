    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to rocky or alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, slopes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic value."
