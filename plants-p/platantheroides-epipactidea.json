    "intro": "Platantheroides epipactidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
