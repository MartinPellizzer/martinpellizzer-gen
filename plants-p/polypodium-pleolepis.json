    "intro": "Polypodium pleolepis, commonly known as the pleated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and can produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
