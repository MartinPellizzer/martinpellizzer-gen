    "intro": "Phillyrea major, commonly known as the common Phillyrea, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Phillyrea major is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
