It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
