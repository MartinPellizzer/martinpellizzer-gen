    "intro": "Populus nigra subsp. neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples Poplar, is a subspecies of the black poplar native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This tree typically grows along riverbanks and in wetland areas, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant is valued for its ecological importance and historical use in traditional medicine."
