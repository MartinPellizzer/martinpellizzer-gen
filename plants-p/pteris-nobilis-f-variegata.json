    "intro": "Pteris nobilis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated water fern, is a fern species characterized by its striking, variegated foliage. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the leaves are often adorned with contrasting colors such as yellow, white, and green. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
