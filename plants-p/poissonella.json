    "intro": "Poissonella, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has bright blue-violet flowers and is characterized by its waxy, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Poissonella is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. It plays a role in water purification but can become invasive if not managed properly."
