    "intro": "Pleurothallis litensis, commonly known as the Litens Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. This small epiphytic orchid typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It features delicate, elongated leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleurothallis litensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
