    "intro": "Platanthera sparsiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its leaves are short and sparse, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
