    "intro": "Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 20 meters in height, often with a ribbed structure and a spiny appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to survive in arid environments, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in desert gardens."
