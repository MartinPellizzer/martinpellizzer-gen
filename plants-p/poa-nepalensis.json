    "intro": "Poa nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
