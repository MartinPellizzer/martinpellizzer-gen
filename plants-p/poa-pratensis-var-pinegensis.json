    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. pinegensis, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or pine forests. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to acidic conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in forested areas."
