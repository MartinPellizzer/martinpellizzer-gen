    "intro": "Parthenocissus inserta, commonly known as the Virginia creeper, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, fences, and trees. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested."
