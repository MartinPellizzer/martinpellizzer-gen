It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a strong, often unpleasant odor. It is typically found in humid, tropical lowland forests and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
