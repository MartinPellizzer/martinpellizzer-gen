    "intro": "Prunus densa, commonly known as the dense cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, which are consumed by various wildlife species. Prunus densa thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
