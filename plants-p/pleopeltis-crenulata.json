    "intro": "Pleopeltis crenulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged fronds that are often lobed and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. This fern typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates and spread vegetatively. The plant's leaves are usually bioluminescent, contributing to its unique ecological role in its habitat."
