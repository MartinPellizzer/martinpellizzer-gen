It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Perdicium mexicanum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
