    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. champlainense, commonly known as the Champlain bracken, is a variant of the common bracken fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This variety is notable for its adaptability and widespread distribution across North America."
