    "intro": "Pilosella bauhini subsp. adenoclada, commonly known as the sticky hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
