    "intro": "Prosopis koelziana, commonly known as the Koelz mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife and humans in some regions. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall conditions."
