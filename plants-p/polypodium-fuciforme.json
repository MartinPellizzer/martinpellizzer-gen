    "intro": "Polypodium fuciforme, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like appearance. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as both a storage organ and a means of anchoring the plant. Its fronds are typically divided into a central stem and a series of lobes, which can vary in shape depending on the species. Polypodium fuciforme is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
