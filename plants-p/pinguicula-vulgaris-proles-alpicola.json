It possesses sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments where sunlight is abundant. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early summer. The species is adapted to cold climates and exhibits a short growing season."
