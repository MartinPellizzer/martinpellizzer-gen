    "intro": "Paullinia connaracea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid climate. Paullinia connaracea is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
