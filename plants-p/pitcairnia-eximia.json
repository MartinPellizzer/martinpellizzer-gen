    "intro": "Pitcairnia eximia, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, vibrant rosette of sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
