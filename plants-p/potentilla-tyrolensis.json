    "intro": "Potentilla tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
