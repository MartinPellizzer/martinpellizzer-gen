    "intro": "Puccinellia fasciculata subsp. pungens, commonly known as the spiked saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to saline and alkaline conditions, making it a valuable species for revegetation in degraded landscapes. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a potential forage plant for livestock."
