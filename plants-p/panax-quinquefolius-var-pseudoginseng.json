    "intro": "Panax quinquefolius var. pseudoginseng, commonly known as American ginseng, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves with five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The plant's roots, which are harvested after several years of growth, are the primary part used in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is valued for its adaptogenic properties. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
