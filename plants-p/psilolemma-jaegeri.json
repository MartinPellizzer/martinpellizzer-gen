    "intro": "Psilolemma jaegeri, commonly known as the Jaeger's psilolemma, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Psilophytales. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which consists of a thin, membranous sheath surrounding the stem. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with simple, undivided leaves that are often described as resembling a sheath or hood. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Psilolemma jaegeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
