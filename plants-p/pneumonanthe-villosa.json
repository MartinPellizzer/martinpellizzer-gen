    "intro": "Pneumonanthe villosa, commonly known as the hairy lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Pneumonanthe villosa is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in environments with partial to full shade."
