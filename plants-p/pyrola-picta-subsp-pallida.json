It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as coniferous forests and rocky slopes. It has a short, creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The subspecies pallida is distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to other subspecies of Pyrola picta."
