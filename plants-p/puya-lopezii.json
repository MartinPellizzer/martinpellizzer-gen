    "intro": "Puya lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Puya lopezii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
