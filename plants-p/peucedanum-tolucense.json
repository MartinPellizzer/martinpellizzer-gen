    "intro": "Peucedanum tolucense, commonly known as the Tolucense angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed, while its flowers are small and white or pale green. Peucedanum tolucense is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments."
