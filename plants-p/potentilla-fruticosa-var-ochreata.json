It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a silvery appearance. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
