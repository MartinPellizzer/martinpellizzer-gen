    "intro": "Parodia schwebsiana var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-colored moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Brazil. It features a swollen, bulbous stem that is typically pink to salmon-colored, with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its colorful body. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. This variety is known for its slow growth and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
