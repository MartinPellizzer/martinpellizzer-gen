    "intro": "Pleioluma queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland pleioluma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming dense clumps with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in umbel-like clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in the region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
