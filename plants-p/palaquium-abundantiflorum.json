    "intro": "Palaquium abundantiflorum, commonly known as the abundant-flowered palaquium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
