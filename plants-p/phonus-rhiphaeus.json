    "intro": "Phonus rhiphaeus, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Phonus rhiphaeus is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophilous habitats."
