    "intro": "Pinus prasina, commonly known as the creeping pine, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, dark green needles that are often twisted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its dense foliage provides excellent ground cover and is often used in horticulture for erosion control. Pinus prasina is well adapted to rocky and acidic soils, thriving in cool, moist climates."
