It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
