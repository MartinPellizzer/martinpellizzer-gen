    "intro": "Phyllorkis conchifera, commonly known as the conchifera lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tight, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in temperate or subpolar regions. The thallus is pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth, leathery texture, and it often has a distinct, irregularly shaped margin. It is chemically distinct, containing usnic acid and other secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role as a bioindicator species. This lichen is commonly found on siliceous substrates and is known for its slow growth and longevity."
