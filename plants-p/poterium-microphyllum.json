    "intro": "Poterium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved potterscale. It is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal."
