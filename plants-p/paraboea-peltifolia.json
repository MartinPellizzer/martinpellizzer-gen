    "intro": "Paraboea peltifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, it is not commonly found in commercial horticulture due to its specific care requirements."
