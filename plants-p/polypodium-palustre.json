    "intro": "Polypodium palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in North America. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
