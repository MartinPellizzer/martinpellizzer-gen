    "intro": "Puya grubbii, commonly known as the Grubb's puya, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Puya grubbii is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
