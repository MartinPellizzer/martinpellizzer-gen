    "intro": "Pseudolithos, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plants typically produce small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Pseudolithos species are native to regions with dry climates, such as parts of Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. They are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
