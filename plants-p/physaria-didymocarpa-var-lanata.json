    "intro": "Physaria didymocarpa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a inflated, bladder-like capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open plains and along roadsides."
