    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved pear, is a variant of the common pear tree characterized by its thick, rugose leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common pear. Its leaves remain persistent throughout the winter, providing visual interest in the landscape. The rough-leaved pear is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
