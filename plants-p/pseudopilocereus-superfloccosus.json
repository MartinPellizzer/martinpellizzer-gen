    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus superfloccosus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
