    "intro": "Pinus nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, mountainous environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
