It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic with a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pseudoclausia papillosa is often found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in cooler climates."
