    "intro": "Paronychia fastigiata var. typica, commonly known as the upright paronychia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
