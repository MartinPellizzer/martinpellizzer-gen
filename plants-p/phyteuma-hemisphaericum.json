    "intro": "Phyteuma hemisphaericum, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue or purple spherical flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has a robust root system and produces showy, cone-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
