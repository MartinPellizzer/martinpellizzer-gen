    "intro": "Pleopeltis apoda, commonly known as the rootless fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Pleopeltis apoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
