    "intro": "Pilosella lactucella subsp. lampreilema, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely pubescent leaves and shorter, more compact growth form compared to the typical species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
