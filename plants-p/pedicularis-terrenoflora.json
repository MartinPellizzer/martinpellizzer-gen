    "intro": "Pedicularis terrenoflora, commonly known as the terrestrial orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, known for its parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
