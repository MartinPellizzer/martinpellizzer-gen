    "intro": "Peucedanum longipedicillatum, commonly known as the long-podded cowparsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pinnately compound leaves with finely divided foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its fruit is a dry, ribbed schizocarp with two mericarps, each bearing a long, slender beak. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and woodland edges, often growing in moist, well-drained soils."
