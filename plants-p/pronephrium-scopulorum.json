    "intro": "Pronephrium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock pronephrium, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, umbellate inflorescences. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of habitat health."
