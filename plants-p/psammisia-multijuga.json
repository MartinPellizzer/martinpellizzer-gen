    "intro": "Psammisia multijuga, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-like growth habit, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fibrous roots that help it retain moisture in sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
