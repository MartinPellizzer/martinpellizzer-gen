    "intro": "Phylica australis, commonly known as the Natal tea or silver bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic tea. Phylica australis is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
