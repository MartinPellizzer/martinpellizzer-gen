    "intro": "Polemonium caeruleum var. foliosissimum, commonly known as the Bluebells of the forest, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often more numerous and broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as an important nectar source for pollinators in its native habitat."
