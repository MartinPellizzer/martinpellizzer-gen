    "intro": "Plantago subverticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and wet meadows. The plant has upright, somewhat hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the skin and respiratory system."
