It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia heterodoxa is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
