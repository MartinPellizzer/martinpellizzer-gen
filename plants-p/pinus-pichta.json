    "intro": "Pinus pichta, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and flaky, becoming thicker and more fissured with age. The white spruce is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas."
