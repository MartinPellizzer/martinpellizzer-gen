    "intro": "Potentilla flabelliformis var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender leaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, serrated leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
