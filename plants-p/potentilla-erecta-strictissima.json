    "intro": "Potentilla erecta strictissima, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
