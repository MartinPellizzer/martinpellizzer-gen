    "intro": "Populus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa, commonly known as black cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkin flowers in early spring, followed by woody capsules that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in riparian zones. This subspecies is valued for its fast growth and historical use in paper production and as a source of medicinal compounds."
