    "intro": "Polystichum atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum atkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
