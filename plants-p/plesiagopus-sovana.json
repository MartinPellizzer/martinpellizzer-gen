    "intro": "Plesiagopus sovana, commonly known as the Sova mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from cold temperatures. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Plesiagopus sovana is considered a rare and endangered species."
