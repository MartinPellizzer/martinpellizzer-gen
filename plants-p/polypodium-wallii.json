    "intro": "Polypodium wallii, commonly known as the Wall's huperzia, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium wallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
