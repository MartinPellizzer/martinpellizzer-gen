    "intro": "Primula odora, commonly known as the sweet violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are characterized by their showy, five-petaled structure. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant, spicy fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
