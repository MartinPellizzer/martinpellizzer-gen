    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. tanfiljewii, commonly known as the Tanfiljev's bentgrass, is a rare and narrowly distributed grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is adapted to grow in rocky or disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and spike-like, with pale green to brown bracts, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
