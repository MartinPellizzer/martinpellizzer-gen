    "intro": "Phyllanthus niruri var. scabrellus, commonly known as stonecress or mouse ear, is a variant of the genus Phyllanthus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, low-growing herbaceous plant with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy or scabrous, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
