This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Chinese fir, with a broader crown and shorter branches. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings."
