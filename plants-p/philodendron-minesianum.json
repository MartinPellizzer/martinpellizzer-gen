    "intro": "Philodendron minesianum, commonly known as the Minnesotan Philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but can become invasive if grown outdoors in suitable climates."
