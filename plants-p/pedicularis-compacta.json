    "intro": "Pedicularis compacta, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with their shape facilitating nectar access. Pedicularis compacta is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationships with certain host plants."
