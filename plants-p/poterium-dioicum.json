    "intro": "Poterium dioicum, commonly known as the common bogbean, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in marshy or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
