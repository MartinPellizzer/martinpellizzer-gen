    "intro": "Pitcairnia nobilis, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and vibrant, showy inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, forming a central tank that collects rainwater. Pitcairnia nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to humid, shaded environments."
