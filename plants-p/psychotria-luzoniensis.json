It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a distinctive red calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
