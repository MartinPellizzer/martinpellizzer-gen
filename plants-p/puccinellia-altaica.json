    "intro": "Puccinellia altaica, commonly known as the Altai needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and arctic regions. Puccinellia altaica plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
