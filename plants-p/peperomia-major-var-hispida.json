It features thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a versatile and low-maintenance houseplant."
