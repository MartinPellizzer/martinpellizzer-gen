    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, oval, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, rounded form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. This cultivar is particularly valued for its neat appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
