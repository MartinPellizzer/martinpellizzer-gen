    "intro": "Plantago oreades var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a central vein and a hairy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated and bloom in the summer months."
