    "intro": "Psychotria agustinae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of western Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
