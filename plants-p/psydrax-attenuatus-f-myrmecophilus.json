    "intro": "Psydrax attenuatus f. myrmecophilus, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with specific ant species, which is a key feature of its ecological role. Its morphology includes a woody stem with lanceolate leaves and small, clustered flowers."
