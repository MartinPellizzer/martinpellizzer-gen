    "intro": "Phyllostachys stolonifera, commonly known as the silver bamboo, is a fast-growing grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of pale green to golden yellow flowers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense clumps. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly through stolons, making it both versatile and potentially invasive."
