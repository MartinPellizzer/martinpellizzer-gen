    "intro": "Pegolettia dubiefiana, commonly known as the Dubief's pegolettia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often at high altitudes, and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
