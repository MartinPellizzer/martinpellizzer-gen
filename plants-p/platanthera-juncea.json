    "intro": "Platanthera juncea, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. It produces a dense, spike-like inflorescence of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
