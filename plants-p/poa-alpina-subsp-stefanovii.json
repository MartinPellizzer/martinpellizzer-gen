    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. stefanovii, commonly known as the Stefanov's alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
