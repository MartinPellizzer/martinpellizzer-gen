    "intro": "Pancheria ajiearoana, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
