    "intro": "Psammotropha diffusa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psammotropha diffusa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
