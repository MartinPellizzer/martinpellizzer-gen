It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
