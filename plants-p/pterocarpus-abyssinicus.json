    "intro": "Pterocarpus abyssinicus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
