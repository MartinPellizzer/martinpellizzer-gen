    "intro": "Phlomis gracilis, commonly known as slender mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Phlomis gracilis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
