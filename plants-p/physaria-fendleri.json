    "intro": "Physaria fendleri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Physaria fendleri is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, hot climates."
