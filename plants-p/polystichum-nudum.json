    "intro": "Polystichum nudum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are usually uncurling and lack the typical fiddlehead stage. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
