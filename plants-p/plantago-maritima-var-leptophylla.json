    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. leptophylla, commonly known as sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer, contributing to its role in stabilizing sandy shorelines. It is often found in dunes and moist sand areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This variety is valued for its resilience and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
