It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
