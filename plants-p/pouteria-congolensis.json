    "intro": "Pouteria congolensis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces a fruit with a thick, inedible outer layer and a fatty, edible kernel inside. The kernel is a source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it grows."
