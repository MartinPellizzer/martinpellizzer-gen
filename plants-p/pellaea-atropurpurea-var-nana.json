It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches tall, with a dark purple hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that give it a soft, feathery appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
