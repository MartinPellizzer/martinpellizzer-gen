    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora subvar. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, with leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
