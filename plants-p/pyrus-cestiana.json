    "intro": "Pyrus cestiana, commonly known as the Cestian pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round pomes that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Pyrus."
