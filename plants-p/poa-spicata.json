    "intro": "Poa spicata, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green leaves. Its flowering inflorescence is a compact panicle, bearing numerous spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
