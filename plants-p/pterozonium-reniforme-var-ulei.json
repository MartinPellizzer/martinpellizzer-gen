    "intro": "Pterozonium reniforme var. ulei, commonly known as the broad-leafed pterozonium, is a rare and specialized fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high moisture levels. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
