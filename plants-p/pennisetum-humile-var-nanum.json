    "intro": "Pennisetum humile var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, silver-gray leaves that are finely textured and emit a subtle, sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in the summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
