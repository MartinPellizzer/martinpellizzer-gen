    "intro": "Pteroneuron, commonly known as the \"feather fern,\" is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small, narrow segments. Pteroneuron species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their rhizomes are usually short and horizontally spreading, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
