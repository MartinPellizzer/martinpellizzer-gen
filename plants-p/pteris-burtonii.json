    "intro": "Pteris burtonii, commonly known as the Burtons' water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, toothed pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of the leaves. Pteris burtonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
