    "intro": "Phyllorkis coriscensis, commonly known as the coastal rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the cooler months. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
