    "intro": "Paliavana schiffneri, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as pink, purple, and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid and seasonal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
