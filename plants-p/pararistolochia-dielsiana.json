It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their complex structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
