    "intro": "Psychotria americana, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant or cohoba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that contain the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has been used in traditional shamanic practices. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it holds cultural and spiritual significance in various indigenous communities."
