    "intro": "Peucedanum howellii, commonly known as Howell's angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, this plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. It features tall, slender stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peucedanum howellii is considered a rare and endangered species."
