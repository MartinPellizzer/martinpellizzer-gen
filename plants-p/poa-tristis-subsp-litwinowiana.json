    "intro": "Poa tristis subsp. litwinowiana, commonly known as the litwinowian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler seasons. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
