    "intro": "Populus funiushanensis, commonly known as the Funiushan poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and slender, weeping branches. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with separate male and female inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
