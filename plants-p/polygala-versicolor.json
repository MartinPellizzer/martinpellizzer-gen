It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds.
