    "intro": "Pyrrosia confluens var. dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Pyrrosia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has lanceolate, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance, and its leaves are usually dark green with a glossy texture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
