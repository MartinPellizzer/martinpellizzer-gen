    "intro": "Populus pubescens var. maserica, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
