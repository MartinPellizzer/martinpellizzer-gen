    "intro": "Polypodium reclinatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and delicate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its fronds are usually dark green and can develop a velvety texture, especially when mature. Polypodium reclinatum is often found in shaded, humid habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
