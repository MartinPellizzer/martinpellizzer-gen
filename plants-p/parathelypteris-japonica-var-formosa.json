    "intro": "Parathelypteris japonica var. formosa, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to East Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often float on the surface of shallow water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The leaves are usually bright green and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
