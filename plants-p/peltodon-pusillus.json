    "intro": "Peltodon pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf moss fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Peltodon pusillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
