    "intro": "Polypodium balbisii, commonly known as the Balbis's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
