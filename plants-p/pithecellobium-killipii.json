    "intro": "Pithecellobium killipii, commonly known as the Killip's crownfruit, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant produces small, clustered pods that contain edible, sweet fruits resembling small beans. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into pairs of leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thorny branches. Pithecellobium killipii is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
