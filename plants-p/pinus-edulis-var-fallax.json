    "intro": "Pinus edulis var. fallax, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a variant of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, edible cones that produce seeds valued by both wildlife and humans. The tree typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Its needle-like leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species. The plant plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species."
