It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Polycodium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
