    "intro": "Pelargonium lousadianum, commonly known as the Lousadian geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces clusters of bright pink to red blooms during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long flowering period."
