    "intro": "Prunus armeniaca var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to apricots but often smaller and more tart. The plant has a rugged, branched structure with thick, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit yield. The variety is particularly hardy, making it suitable for colder regions compared to other apricot species."
