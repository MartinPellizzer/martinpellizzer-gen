    "intro": "Pyrus hopeiensis var. peninsula, commonly known as the Peninsula pear, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically small, sweet, and edible, with a thin, crisp skin. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
