    "intro": "Pentzia viridis, commonly known as the green pentzia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright green leaves that are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. It blooms with tiny, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
