    "intro": "Poincianella pluviosa, commonly known as the rain tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical environments. The rain tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in landscaping."
