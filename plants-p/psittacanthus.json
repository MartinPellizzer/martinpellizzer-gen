    "intro": "Psittacanthus, commonly known as the golden wax tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, waxy, yellow-orange leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences. Psittacanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant foliage and unique appearance. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making them suitable for indoor cultivation."
