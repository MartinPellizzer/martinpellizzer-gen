    "intro": "Psychotria halophiloides, commonly known as the salt-tolerant Psychotria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in mangrove swamps and coastal hammocks. Its ability to withstand high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Psychotria halophiloides also serves as a food source for certain insect species and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
