    "intro": "Psilocaulon candidum, commonly known as the white-flowered lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth is slow and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern."
