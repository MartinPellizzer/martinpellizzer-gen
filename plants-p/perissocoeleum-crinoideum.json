    "intro": "Perissocoeleum crinoideum, commonly known as the star-coral sponge, is a unique marine organism that exhibits both sponge and coral-like characteristics. It belongs to the order Astrophorida and is found in shallow tropical waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The plant has a branching, tree-like structure with a central axis and radial symmetry, resembling a flower or star. Its body is composed of a porous skeleton made of silica, which provides structural support and facilitates water flow for nutrient absorption. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various small organisms."
