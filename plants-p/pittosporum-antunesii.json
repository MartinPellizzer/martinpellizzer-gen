    "intro": "Pittosporum antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of glossy, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Pittosporum antunesii is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
