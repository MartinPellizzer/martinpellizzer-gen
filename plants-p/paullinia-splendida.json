    "intro": "Paullinia splendida, commonly known as the golden guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Paullinia splendida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant in warm climates."
