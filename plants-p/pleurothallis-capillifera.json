It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
