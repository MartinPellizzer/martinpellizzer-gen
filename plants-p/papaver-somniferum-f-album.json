    "intro": "Papaver somniferum f. album, commonly known as the white poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with the typical dark red or purple hues of the species. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain alkaloids, some of which have medicinal and illicit uses."
