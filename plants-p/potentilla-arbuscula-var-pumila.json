    "intro": "Potentilla arbuscula var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
