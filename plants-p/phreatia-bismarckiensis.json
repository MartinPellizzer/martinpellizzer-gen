It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinct lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
