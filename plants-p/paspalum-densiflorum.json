    "intro": "Paspalum densiflorum, commonly known as denseflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features tufted clumps of narrow, dark green leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, and it is often used in native plant gardens. Paspalum densiflorum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
