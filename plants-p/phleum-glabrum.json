    "intro": "Phleum glabrum, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is both a common weed and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
