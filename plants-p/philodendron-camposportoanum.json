    "intro": "Philodendron camposportoanum, commonly known as the Brazilian Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but should be handled with care as it is considered toxic."
