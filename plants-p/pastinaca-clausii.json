    "intro": "Pastinaca clausii, commonly known as the Persian salsify, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the umbelliferous group. Its roots are often harvested for culinary use, though they are less commonly consumed than those of related species. Pastinaca clausii is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
