    "intro": "Prevostea heudelotii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prevostea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. This variant is less common than the typical form of Prevostea heudelotii and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its alpine environment."
