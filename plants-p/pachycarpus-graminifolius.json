    "intro": "Pachycarpus graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-like cycad, is a unique plant with a distinct botanical structure. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its rosette arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant has a short, unbranched trunk that is often buried underground, supporting its overall growth form. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, typical of cycads, which are pollinated by insects. This plant is adapted to arid environments and exhibits slow growth, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
