    "intro": "Potentilla pulvinaris subsp. argentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
