    "intro": "Pleurothallis chanchamayoensis, commonly known as the Chanchamayo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Peruvian Andes. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate markings. It has narrow, linear leaves that help it conserve water in its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
