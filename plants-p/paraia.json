It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been studied for potential pharmaceutical applications. The Paraia thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky terrain."
