    "intro": "Peperomia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorean pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the humid forests of Ecuador. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia ecuadorensis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
