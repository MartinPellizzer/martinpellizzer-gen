    "intro": "Phalaenopsis regnieriana, commonly known as the Regnier's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom sequentially along the stem. Its leaves are broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
