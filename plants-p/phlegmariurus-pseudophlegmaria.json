    "intro": "Phlegmariurus pseudophlegmaria, commonly known as the false phlegmariurus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is usually flattened and ribbon-like, with a distinct central strand of cells. It reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the upper surface of the thallus. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
