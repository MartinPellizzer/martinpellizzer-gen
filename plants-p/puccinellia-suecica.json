    "intro": "Puccinellia suecica, commonly known as the Swedish glassworts, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other moist, nutrient-poor environments. Puccinellia suecica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
