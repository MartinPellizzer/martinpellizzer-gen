It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its leaves are notable for their serrated edges and aromatic properties, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance.
