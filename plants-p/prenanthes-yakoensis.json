    "intro": "Prenanthes yakoensis, commonly known as Yako bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Japan. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
