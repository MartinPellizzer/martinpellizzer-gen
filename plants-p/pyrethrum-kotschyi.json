    "intro": "Pyrethrum kotschyi, commonly known as the Persian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins. These compounds make it effective for pest control in organic gardening. Pyrethrum kotschyi is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its medicinal and agricultural applications."
