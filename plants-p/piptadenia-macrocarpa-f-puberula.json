It is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its specific epithet \"puberula.\" The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain flattened, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
