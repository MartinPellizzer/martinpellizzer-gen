It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
