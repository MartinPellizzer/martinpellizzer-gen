It features compact, bushy growth with fleshy, slightly hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
