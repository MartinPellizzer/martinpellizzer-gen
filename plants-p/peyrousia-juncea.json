    "intro": "Peyrousia juncea, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Peyrousia juncea is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
