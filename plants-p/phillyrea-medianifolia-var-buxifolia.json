    "intro": "Phillyrea medianifolia var. buxifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Phillyrea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its dense growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to landscape designs."
