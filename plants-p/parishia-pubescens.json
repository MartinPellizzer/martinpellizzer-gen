    "intro": "Parishia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy parishia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are hairy and oval-shaped, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Parishia pubescens is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
