    "intro": "Ptilophora major, commonly known as the giant feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dense, feathery growth habit and elongated, branching stems. The plant forms compact, cushion-like mats and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Ptilophora major plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
