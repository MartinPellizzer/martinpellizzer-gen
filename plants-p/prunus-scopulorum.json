    "intro": "Prunus scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are dark purple to black in color. Prunus scopulorum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
