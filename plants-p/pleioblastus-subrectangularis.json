    "intro": "Pleioblastus subrectangularis, commonly known as the rectangular bamboo, is a species native to East Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that are often slightly twisted and have a smooth, pale green to bluish-green surface. The leaves are linear, narrow, and slightly folded, giving the plant a delicate, grass-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. This bamboo is also valued for its resilience and ability to form dense clumps over time."
