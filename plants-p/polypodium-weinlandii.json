It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium weinlandii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings with proper care."
