    "intro": "Poa acinaciphylla, commonly known as the swordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa acinaciphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
