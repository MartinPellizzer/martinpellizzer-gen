    "intro": "Phelypaea indica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, needle-like pinnae. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize water sediments. Phelypaea indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in water ecosystems."
