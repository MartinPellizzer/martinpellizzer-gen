    "intro": "Pseudomaxillaria grisebachiana, commonly known as the Grisebach's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with pale green to yellow petals and sepals, often with a darker lip. It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
