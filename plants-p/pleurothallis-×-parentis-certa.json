It is a sympodial orchid with a short rhizome and produces multiple pseudobulbs that support its growth. The plant typically has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, making it popular among orchid enthusiasts."
