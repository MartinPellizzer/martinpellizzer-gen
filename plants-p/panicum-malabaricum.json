    "intro": "Panicum malabaricum, commonly known as Malabar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in landscaping and for erosion control in tropical and subtropical areas."
