    "intro": "Pandanus desmetianus, commonly known as the Desmetian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits known as \"breadfruits.\" Its adaptability to coastal and sandy soils makes it a common sight in coastal regions. The Desmetian pandanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
