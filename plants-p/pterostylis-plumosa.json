    "intro": "Pterostylis plumosa, commonly known as the plumose hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, erect flower that has a distinctive hood-like structure. Its sepals and petals are pale green to yellowish, with a prominent, fluffy, plumose appearance on the dorsal sepal. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in forest ecosystems."
