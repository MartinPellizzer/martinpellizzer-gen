    "intro": "Prosopis pallida, commonly known as the white mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, white or pale green leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, flat pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. Prosopis pallida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
