    "intro": "Plocama ehrendorferi, commonly known as the Ehrendorfer's plocama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts."
