    "intro": "Picea pyramidalis, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. The white spruce is valued for its timber and its role in ecological systems."
