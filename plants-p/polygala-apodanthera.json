    "intro": "Polygala apodanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, usually greenish or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically bisexual, with a distinctive structure that includes a narrow, tubular corolla and a specialized pollen presenter. Polygala apodanthera is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
