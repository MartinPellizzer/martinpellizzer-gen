    "intro": "Potalia amara var. resinifera, commonly known as the resinous bitter potalia, is a variant of the potalia genus native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and leaves that emit a strong, resinous aroma, particularly when crushed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its resin has been traditionally used in local medicinal practices for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique chemical composition, which includes various terpenoids and alkaloids."
