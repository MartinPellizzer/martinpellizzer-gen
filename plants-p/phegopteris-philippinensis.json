    "intro": "Phegopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, oblong segments. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rice paddies. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
