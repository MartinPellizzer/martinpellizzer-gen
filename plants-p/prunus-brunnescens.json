    "intro": "Prunus brunnescens, commonly known as the brown cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark brown, often fissured bark and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Prunus brunnescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting local wildlife."
