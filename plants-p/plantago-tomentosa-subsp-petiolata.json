It features a basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces erect flowering stems that bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. This subspecies is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
