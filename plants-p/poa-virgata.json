    "intro": "Poa virgata, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Poa virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
