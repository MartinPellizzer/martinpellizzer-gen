It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
