It features long, narrow leaves that are typically oval in shape, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native environments."
