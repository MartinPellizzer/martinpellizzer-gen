    "intro": "Pleopeltis selligueoides, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
