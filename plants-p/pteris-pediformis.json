    "intro": "Pteris pediformis, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that produce upright, lance-shaped fronds. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost zigzag appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris pediformis is known for its ability to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in forest understories."
