    "intro": "Pterospermum glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth pterospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Pterospermum glabrescens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
