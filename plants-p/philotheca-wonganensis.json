    "intro": "Philotheca wonganensis, commonly known as the Wongan pepperberry, is a small, erect shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
