    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
