    "intro": "Pilea leucophaea, commonly known as the silver pilea, is a compact, low-growing houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a striking silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea leucophaea is prized for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
