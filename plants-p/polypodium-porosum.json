    "intro": "Polypodium porosum, commonly known as the porous polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and fertile shoots. The spores are released from the sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds."
