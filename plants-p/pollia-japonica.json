    "intro": "Pollia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese velvet tassel, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences that resemble tassels. The plant produces small, green to brown spores rather than true flowers, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its striking, velvety appearance."
