    "intro": "Ptychosperma maculatum, commonly known as the spotted cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces distinctive, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are often spotted with a pale, waxy coating, giving it its common name. Ptychosperma maculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
