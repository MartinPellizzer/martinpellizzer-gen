    "intro": "Phleum arenarium subsp. caesium, commonly known as silvergrass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and meadows. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
