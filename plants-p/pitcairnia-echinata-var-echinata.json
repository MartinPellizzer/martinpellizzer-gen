    "intro": "Pitcairnia echinata var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence and rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests. Its foliage is usually dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
