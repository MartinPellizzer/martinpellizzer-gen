    "intro": "Potentilla humifusa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to North America. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for erosion control and garden landscaping."
