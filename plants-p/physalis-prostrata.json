    "intro": "Physalis prostrata, commonly known as the groundcherries or husk tomatoes, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, lantern-like calyx. The plant typically grows in a prostrate or sprawling manner, often covering the ground with its hairy, green stems. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs. The fruit, which ripens to a bright orange or red, is often used in culinary applications and has a sweet-tart flavor."
