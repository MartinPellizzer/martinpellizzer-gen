    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum uvidulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered growth habit. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a tubular shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
