    "intro": "Pyrola pallida, commonly known as the pale snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often persisting through the winter, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola pallida is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
