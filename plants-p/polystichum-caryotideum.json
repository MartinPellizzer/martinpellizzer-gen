    "intro": "Polystichum caryotideum, commonly known as the broadleaf woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
