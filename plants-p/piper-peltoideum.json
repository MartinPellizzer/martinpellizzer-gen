    "intro": "Piper peltoideum, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by clusters of three-sided, blue-black berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
