    "intro": "Pavetta badullensis, commonly known as the Badulli pavetta, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its dispersal in natural habitats."
