    "intro": "Potentilla villosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Potentilla villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
