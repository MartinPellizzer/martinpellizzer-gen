    "intro": "Peuce larix, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a species of coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically bright yellow to golden in color, and its cone-like structures that contain its seeds. The tree is well adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system and a ability to withstand extreme cold. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Peuce larix plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
