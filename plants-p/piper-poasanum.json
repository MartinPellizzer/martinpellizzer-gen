    "intro": "Piper poasanum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern, and its small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
