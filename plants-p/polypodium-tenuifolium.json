    "intro": "Polypodium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds have a distinctive, arching shape and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
