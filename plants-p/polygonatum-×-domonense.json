    "intro": "Polygonatum \u00d7 domonense, commonly known as the Japanese Solomon's seal, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Polygonatum sibiricum and Polygonatum multiflorum. It is a perennial herb native to East Asia, characterized by its rhizomatous growth and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
