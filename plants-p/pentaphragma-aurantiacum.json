    "intro": "Pentaphragma aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption. The bright yellow color of its bladders gives the plant its common name and makes it visually distinctive."
