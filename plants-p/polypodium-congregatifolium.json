    "intro": "Polypodium congregatifolium, commonly known as the clustered polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds."
