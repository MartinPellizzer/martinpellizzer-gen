    "intro": "Pleopeltis alansmithii, commonly known as the Alansmith's rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features intricate, lanceolate fronds with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
