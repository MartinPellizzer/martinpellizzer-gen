    "intro": "Panicum nudum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, Panicum nudum is often found in wetland restoration projects and natural habitats."
