    "intro": "Phillyrea subangustifolia subsp. valdesulcata, commonly known as the Valdesulcata Phillyrea, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often adorned with distinctive leaf margins. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
