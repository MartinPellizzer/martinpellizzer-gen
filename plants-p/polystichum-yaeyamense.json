    "intro": "Polystichum yaeyamense, commonly known as Yaeyama holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Polystichum yaeyamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
