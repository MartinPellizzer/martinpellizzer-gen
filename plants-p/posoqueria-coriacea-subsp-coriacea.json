    "intro": "Posoqueria coriacea subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf papyrus, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a coarse, fibrous texture. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it produces small, white, clustered flowers. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for making ropes and mats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
