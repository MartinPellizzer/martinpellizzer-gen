    "intro": "Pilea rugosa, commonly known as the pebble plant, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive, slightly rough texture. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and vary in color from pale green to bluish-green, depending on light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which are followed by tiny, round berries. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low light and its minimal water requirements."
