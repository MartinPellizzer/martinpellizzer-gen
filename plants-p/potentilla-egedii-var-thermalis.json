It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or volcanic habitats. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly hairy surface, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
