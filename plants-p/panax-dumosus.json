    "intro": "Panax dumosus, commonly known as the dwarf ginseng, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots, which are similar in appearance to those of Panax ginseng, are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Panax dumosus is considered an endangered species."
