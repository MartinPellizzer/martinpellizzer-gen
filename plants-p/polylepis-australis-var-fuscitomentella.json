    "intro": "Polylepis australis var. fuscitomentella, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of southern South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and silver-gray bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
