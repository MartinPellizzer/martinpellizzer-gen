    "intro": "Pterostylis pedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. The plant features a single, narrow leaf and produces a single or few greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted by the scent and color. The species is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
