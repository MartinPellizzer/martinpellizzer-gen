    "intro": "Phyllorkis petiolaris, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Phyllorkis petiolaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
