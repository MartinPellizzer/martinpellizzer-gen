    "intro": "Pterodiscus luridus, commonly known as the lurid disc fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Pterodiscus luridus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
