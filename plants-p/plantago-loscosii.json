    "intro": "Plantago loscosii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in a dense spike and bloom in the summer months. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is an important part of the local alpine ecosystem."
