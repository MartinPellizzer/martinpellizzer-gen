    "intro": "Peucedanum puberulum, commonly known as the woolly hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can be quite large, often with a strong, aromatic scent. Peucedanum puberulum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including meadows and woodland edges."
