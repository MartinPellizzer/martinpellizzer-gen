    "intro": "Pterostylis rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wetter areas such as rainforests and swampy woodlands, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a slender, reddish stem and produces a single, resupinate (upside-down) greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like. The orchid is pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its unique floral structure and scent."
