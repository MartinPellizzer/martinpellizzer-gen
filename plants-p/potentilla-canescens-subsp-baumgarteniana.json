    "intro": "Potentilla canescens subsp. baumgarteniana, commonly known as the Baumann's cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
