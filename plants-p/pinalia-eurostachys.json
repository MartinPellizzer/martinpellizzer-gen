    "intro": "Pinalia eurostachys, commonly known as the silverleaf pinyon, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The silverleaf pinyon is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil with minimal water."
