It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other species known for their stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and can produce a mild stinging sensation when touched. Polyactium triste produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's subtle appearance."
