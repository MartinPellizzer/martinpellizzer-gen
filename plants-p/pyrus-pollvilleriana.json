It is native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, where it grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its arid and coastal environment."
