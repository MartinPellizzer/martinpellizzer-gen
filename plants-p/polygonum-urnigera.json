    "intro": "Polygonum urnigera, commonly known as the urn-shaped knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that often become woody with age. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Polygonum urnigera thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges."
