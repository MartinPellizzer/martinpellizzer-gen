    "intro": "Phylica oleifolia, commonly known as the silver bush or coastal phylica, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Phylica oleifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
