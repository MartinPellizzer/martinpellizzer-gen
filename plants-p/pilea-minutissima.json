    "intro": "Pilea minutissima, commonly known as the baby rubber plant, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, round, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea minutissima is popular as a houseplant due to its easy care requirements and attractive foliage."
