    "intro": "Picea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green foliage, and needle-like leaves that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are typically 4 to 8 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The Mexican fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
