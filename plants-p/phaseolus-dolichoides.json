    "intro": "Phaseolus dolichoides, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a climbing legume native to Central and South America. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Phaseolus genus. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
