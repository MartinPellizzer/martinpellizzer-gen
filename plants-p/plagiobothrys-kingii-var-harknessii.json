    "intro": "Plagiobothrys kingii var. harknessii, commonly known as the Harkness's plagiobothrys, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
