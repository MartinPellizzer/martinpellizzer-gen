It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered with dense, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
