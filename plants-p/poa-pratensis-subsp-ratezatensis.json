    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. ratezatensis, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of short hairs. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands at high elevations. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
