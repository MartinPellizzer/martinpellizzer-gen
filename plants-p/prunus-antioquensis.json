    "intro": "Prunus antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Andes region of Colombia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are typically less sweet. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
