    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, rocky soils along streambanks and forest edges. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the Potentilla genus, which are often used in native plant gardens."
