    "intro": "Pelatantheria cristata, commonly known as the crested lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, cream-colored flowers that bloom in a loose spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Pelatantheria cristata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
