    "intro": "Prunus tuberculata, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or rock cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart red berries that are edible but often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Prunus tuberculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
