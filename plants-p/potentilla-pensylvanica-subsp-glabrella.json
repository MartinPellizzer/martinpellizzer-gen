    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica subsp. glabrella, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for garden use."
