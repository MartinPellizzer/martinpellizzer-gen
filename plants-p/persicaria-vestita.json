It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish tinge, especially along the veins. This herbaceous perennial is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
