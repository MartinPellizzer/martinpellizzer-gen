    "intro": "Pilostyles berteroi, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits a highly specialized parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its elongated, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its reproductive strategy involves producing minute seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new host plants. Due to its specialized nature, Pilostyles berteroi is found in specific habitats where its host plants are present, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
