    "intro": "Pereskia lychnidiflora, commonly known as the candleflower cactus, is a shrub-like plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in stiff, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are small and often shed during periods of drought, a common adaptation in arid environments. Pereskia lychnidiflora is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well-suited for survival in tropical and semi-arid regions."
