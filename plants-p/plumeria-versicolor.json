    "intro": "Plumeria versicolor, commonly known as the West Indian frangipani, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, yellow, and red, depending on the variety and age of the bloom. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are borne on long, slender peduncles and are highly valued for their ornamental appeal. Plumeria versicolor is also known for its strong, sweet fragrance, which is most prominent in the evening."
