    "intro": "Petrocosmea wui, commonly known as the Wui's rock orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Petrocosmea wui is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
