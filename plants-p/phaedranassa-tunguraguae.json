It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, intricate flowers are pollinated by specific insects, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss, Phaedranassa tunguraguae is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
