    "intro": "Pteris laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
