    "intro": "Prunus hiemalis, commonly known as the winter cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces edible red berries that ripen in the fall, which are consumed by various wildlife species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Prunus hiemalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
