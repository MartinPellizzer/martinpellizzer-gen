    "intro": "Pandanus alticonvexus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching due to their durability. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
