    "intro": "Phyllanthus insulensis, commonly known as the island phyllanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils, showing some degree of salt tolerance. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in its native habitat."
