    "intro": "Polypodium incanum var. burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically grayish-white in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
