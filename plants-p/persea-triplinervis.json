    "intro": "Persea triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with three prominent veins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to reddish fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The fruit has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its ornamental value and unique foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
