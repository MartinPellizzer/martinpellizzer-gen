    "intro": "Poa miliacea, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to dry conditions. Poa miliacea is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
