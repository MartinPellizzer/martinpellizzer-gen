    "intro": "Potentilla kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly around Mount Kinabalu. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
