    "intro": "Pandanus clausus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which eventually develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, making them useful for thatching and weaving. Pandanus clausus thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near water sources."
