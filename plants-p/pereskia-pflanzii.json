    "intro": "Pereskia pflanzii, commonly known as the Pflanz's cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its stems are covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Pereskia pflanzii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
