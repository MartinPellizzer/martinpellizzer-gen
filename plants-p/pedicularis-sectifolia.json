It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
