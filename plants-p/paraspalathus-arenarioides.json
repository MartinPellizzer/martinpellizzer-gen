    "intro": "Paraspalathus arenarioides, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in sandy soils with low moisture, often found in coastal or desert environments. Its growth pattern is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats to reduce water loss. Paraspalathus arenarioides plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
