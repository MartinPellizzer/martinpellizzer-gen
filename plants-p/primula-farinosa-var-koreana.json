    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. koreana, commonly known as the Korean primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or brown throat. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. It thrives in partially shaded, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms and hardy nature."
