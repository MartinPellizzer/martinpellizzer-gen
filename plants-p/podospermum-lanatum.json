    "intro": "Podospermum lanatum, commonly known as the hairy podospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Podospermum lanatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
