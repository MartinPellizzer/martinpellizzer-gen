    "intro": "Ptilosia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, rich soils. Ptilosia is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
