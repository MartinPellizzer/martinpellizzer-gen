    "intro": "Pycnocoma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its native, often arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pycnocoma hirsuta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
