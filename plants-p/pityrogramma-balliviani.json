    "intro": "Pityrogramma balliviani, commonly known as the Ballivi\u00f1a water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's simple, dichotomous branching pattern and lack of true roots make it a unique example of a free-floating fern species."
