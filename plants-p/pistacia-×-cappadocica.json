It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its dense, rugged foliage and produces small, yellowish-green leaves. Its fruit is a woody drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance. The tree is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid landscapes."
