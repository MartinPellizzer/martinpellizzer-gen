    "intro": "Pachyctenium, commonly known as the broad-leafed grass or false panic grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It consists of several species native to Australia, characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Pachyctenium species are adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help them survive in nutrient-poor soils."
