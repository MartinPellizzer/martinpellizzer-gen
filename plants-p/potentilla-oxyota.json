    "intro": "Potentilla oxyota, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla oxyota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
