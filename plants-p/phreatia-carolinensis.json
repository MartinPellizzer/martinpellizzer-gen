    "intro": "Phreatia carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolinian phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting it to its often humid and semi-aquatic habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. Phreatia carolinensis is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
