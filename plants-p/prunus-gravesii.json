    "intro": "Prunus gravesii, commonly known as the desert peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible drupes that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep roots and waxy leaf surfaces to conserve water. Prunus gravesii plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife species."
