    "intro": "Poa subtilis, commonly known as the fine-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically forms a low-growing sod and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa subtilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and durability."
