    "intro": "Polygonum neglectum, commonly known as red root or prostrate knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white or reddish in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Polygonum neglectum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
