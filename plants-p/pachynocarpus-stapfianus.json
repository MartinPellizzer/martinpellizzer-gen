    "intro": "Pachynocarpus stapfianus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, hibiscus-like flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its natural habitat."
