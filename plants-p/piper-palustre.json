    "intro": "Piper palustre, commonly known as swamp pepper or water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream edges. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
