    "intro": "Pneumatopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are pinnately divided with long, slender pinnae, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Pneumatopteris longipes plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
