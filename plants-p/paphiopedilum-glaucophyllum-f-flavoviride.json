    "intro": "Paphiopedilum glaucophyllum f. flavoviride, commonly known as the yellow-green phallic orchid, is a rare and striking hybrid orchid characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure. This cultivar exhibits a distinctive yellow-green coloration on its petals and sepals, which sets it apart from the typical blue-green hues of the parent species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil, typical of its natural habitat in Southeast Asia. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and collectors."
