    "intro": "Populus tacamahacca, commonly known as the Andean poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Populus tacamahacca plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for medicinal and cultural purposes."
