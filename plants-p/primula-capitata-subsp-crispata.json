    "intro": "Primula capitata subsp. crispata, commonly known as the curly primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is notable for its finely curled petals, which give it a unique and ornamental look. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
