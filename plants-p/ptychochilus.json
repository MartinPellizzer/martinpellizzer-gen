    "intro": "Ptychochilus, commonly known as the \"hairy lip\" orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their unique, hairy lip petals that give them their common name. Ptychochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitats. They produce small, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic beauty in gardens and collections."
