It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
