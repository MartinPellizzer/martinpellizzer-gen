    "intro": "Pagamea duidana, commonly known as the Duidana pagamea, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pagamea duidana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
