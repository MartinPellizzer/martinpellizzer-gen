It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
