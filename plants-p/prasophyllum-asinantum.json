    "intro": "Prasophyllum asinantum, commonly known as the slender leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, white or pale green flowers. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in coastal or near-coastal areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
