    "intro": "Physalis staminea, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or goldenberry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx that resembles a lantern. The plant has hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fruit is edible, with a tart flavor and a texture similar to a tomato, often used in jams, sauces, and as a snack."
