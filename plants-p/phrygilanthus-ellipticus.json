    "intro": "Phrygilanthus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic phrygilanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
