    "intro": "Plinthus arenarius, commonly known as the sandstone plant, is a rare flowering species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for arid ecosystems."
