    "intro": "Polypodium pervillei, commonly known as the Perville's huperzia, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, compact foliage that often forms a rosette-like structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium pervillei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
