    "intro": "Pigea glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray bloom. Pigea glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
