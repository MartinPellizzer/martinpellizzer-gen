    "intro": "Pteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Pteris gracilis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
