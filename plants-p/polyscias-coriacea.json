    "intro": "Polyscias coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing resistance to drought and mechanical damage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
