    "intro": "Primula microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Primula microstachys is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
