    "intro": "Pleopeltis valetoniana, commonly known as the Valeton's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
