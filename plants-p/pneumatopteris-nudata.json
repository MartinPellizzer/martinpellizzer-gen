    "intro": "Pneumatopteris nudata, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots at the nodes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a smooth, glossy surface and a light green color. Pneumatopteris nudata prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
