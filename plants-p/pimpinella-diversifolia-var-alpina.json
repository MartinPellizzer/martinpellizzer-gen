It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a finely toothed margin, and the plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
