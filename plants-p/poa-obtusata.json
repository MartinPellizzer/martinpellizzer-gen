    "intro": "Poa obtusata, commonly known as the blunt leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often bluntly tipped. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Poa obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
