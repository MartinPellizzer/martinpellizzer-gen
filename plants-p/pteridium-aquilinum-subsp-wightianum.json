    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. wightianum, commonly known as the common bracken, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, which can impact local ecosystems."
