    "intro": "Poa cita, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and pastures. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa cita is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
