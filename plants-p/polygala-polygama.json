    "intro": "Polygala polygama, commonly known as the sweet root or honey root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique, aromatic root that has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
