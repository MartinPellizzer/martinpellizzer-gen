    "intro": "Pyrus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, reddish-barked trunk. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellow or red fruits that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Pyrus ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal interest."
