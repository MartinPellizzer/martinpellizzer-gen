    "intro": "Poa debilis var. acutiflora, commonly known as the acute-flowered meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
