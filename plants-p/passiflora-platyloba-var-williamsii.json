It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses, though it requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
