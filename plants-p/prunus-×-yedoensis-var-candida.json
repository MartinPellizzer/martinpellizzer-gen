It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Prunus serrulata and Prunus lannesii. The tree typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that cover the branches. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks. The leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and the tree has a moderate growth rate."
