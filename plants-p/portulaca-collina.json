    "intro": "Portulaca collina, commonly known as the common portulaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in arid and sandy environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Portulaca collina is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
