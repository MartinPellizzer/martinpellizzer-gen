    "intro": "Prasophyllum keltonii, commonly known as the Kelton\u2019s leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem bearing a spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their muted color. It is typically found in heathland and woodland environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Prasophyllum keltonii is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is protected under various conservation programs."
