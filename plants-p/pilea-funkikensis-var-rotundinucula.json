    "intro": "Pilea funkikensis var. rotundinucula, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact, low-growing houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are dark green with a glossy surface, often tinged with silver or white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
