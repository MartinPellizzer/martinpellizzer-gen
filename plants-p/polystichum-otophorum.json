    "intro": "Polystichum otophorum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
