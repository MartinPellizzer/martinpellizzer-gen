    "intro": "Petrophile filifolia subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock-heath, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in heathlands and on granite outcrops, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
