    "intro": "Pittiera, commonly known as the Australian tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage, which contains high levels of essential oils, particularly cineole. Pittiera is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
