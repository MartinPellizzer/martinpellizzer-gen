    "intro": "Polypodium aureum var. leucatomos, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the ground. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
