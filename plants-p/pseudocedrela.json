    "intro": "Pseudocedrela, commonly known as African teak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It consists of several species, including Pseudocedrela kewensis and Pseudocedrela elliptica, which are native to tropical Africa. These trees are characterized by their dense, aromatic wood and are often found in moist lowland forests. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Pseudocedrela species are valued for their timber but are also important in ecological and medicinal contexts."
