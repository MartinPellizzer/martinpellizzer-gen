    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium badium, commonly known as the lesser coneflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pseudognaphalium badium is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
