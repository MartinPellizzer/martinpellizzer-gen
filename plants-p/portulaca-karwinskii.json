It features fleshy, thick leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. It has a sprawling growth habit and often forms dense mats on the ground. Portulaca karwinskii is also known for its edible leaves and is sometimes used in traditional cuisines."
