    "intro": "Psychopsis papilio var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered psychopsis, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with white petals and a prominent yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a short, stocky stem and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
