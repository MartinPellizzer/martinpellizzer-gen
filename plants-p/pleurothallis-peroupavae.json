    "intro": "Pleurothallis peroupavae, commonly known as the Peroup\u00e1vae orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small epiphytic orchid with a compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
