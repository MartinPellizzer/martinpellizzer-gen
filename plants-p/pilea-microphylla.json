    "intro": "Pilea microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, round, glossy leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Pilea microphylla is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to enhance indoor spaces with its lush foliage."
