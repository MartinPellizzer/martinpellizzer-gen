    "intro": "Pyrrosia confluens, commonly known as the clustered cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has pinnately divided fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, which is reflected in its scientific name. Pyrrosia confluens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
