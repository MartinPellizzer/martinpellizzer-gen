    "intro": "Poa abbreviata subsp. pattersonii, commonly known as Patterson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high-altitude regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and taxonomic studies."
