    "intro": "Phyllagathis ovalifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare oval-leaved phyllagathis, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
