    "intro": "Plectaneia elastica f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rubber plant, is a variant of the rubber plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The hairy texture of its leaves also helps in reducing water loss, making it somewhat drought-tolerant."
