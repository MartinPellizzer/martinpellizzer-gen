    "intro": "Pteris lunulata, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a pale, crescent-shaped mark near the base, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are typically short and produce a dense cluster of fronds. Pteris lunulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
