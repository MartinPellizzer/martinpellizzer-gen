It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which develop into capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including lawns, roadsides, and disturbed soils, due to its adaptability and resilience. This feral form is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
