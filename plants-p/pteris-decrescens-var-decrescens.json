    "intro": "Pteris decrescens var. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This variety is noted for its adaptability to wet conditions and is often used in horticulture for water gardens."
