    "intro": "Poa parvula, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa parvula is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
