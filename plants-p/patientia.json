    "intro": "Patientia, commonly known as the peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces striking white or greenish-white flowers that are actually modified leaves called spathes. Patientia thrives in low light conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
