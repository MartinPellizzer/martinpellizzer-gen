    "intro": "Pituranthos battandieri var. tuszonii, commonly known as the tussonii variant of the battandieri rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
