    "intro": "Protasparagus subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf protasparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spine-tipped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
