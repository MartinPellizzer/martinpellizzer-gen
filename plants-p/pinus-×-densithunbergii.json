    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 densithunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between Pinus thunbergii and Pinus densata. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its dense, pyramidal crown that becomes more compact with age. The needles are typically long, stiff, and dark green, often arranged in bundles of five. It produces cones that are woody and persistent, with scales that open to release seeds. This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
