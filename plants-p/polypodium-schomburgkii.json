    "intro": "Polypodium schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
