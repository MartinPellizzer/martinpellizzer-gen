    "intro": "Pentacalia barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahon mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
