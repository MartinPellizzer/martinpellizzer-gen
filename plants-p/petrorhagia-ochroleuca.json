    "intro": "Petrorhagia ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Petrorhagia ochroleuca is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
