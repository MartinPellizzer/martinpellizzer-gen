    "intro": "Penducella platysepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal penducel, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and the sepals are broad and prominent, giving the plant its common name. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
