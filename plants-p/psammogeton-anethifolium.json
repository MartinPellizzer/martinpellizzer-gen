    "intro": "Psammogeton anethifolium, commonly known as the carrot grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of wild carrots due to their similar appearance. Psammogeton anethifolium is typically found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
