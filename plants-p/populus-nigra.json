It is a tall, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a heart-shaped base, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. Its bark is dark, fissured, and becomes flaky with age, while its flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The tree is often found near water sources and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
