    "intro": "Polypodium lepidotrichum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium lepidotrichum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
