    "intro": "Pharnaceum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine pharnaceum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pharnaceum alpinum is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
