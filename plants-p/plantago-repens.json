    "intro": "Plantago repens, commonly known as common plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly across lawns and disturbed soils. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a prominent central vein. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and are borne on slender spikes. Plantago repens is known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves often used in traditional remedies for skin irritations and inflammation."
