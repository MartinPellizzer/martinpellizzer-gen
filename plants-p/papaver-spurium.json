    "intro": "Papaver spurium, commonly known as the meadow poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red border. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Papaver spurium prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
