    "intro": "Parsonsia franchetii, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature."
