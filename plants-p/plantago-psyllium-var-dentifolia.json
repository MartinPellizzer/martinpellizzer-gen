    "intro": "Plantago psyllium var. dentifolia, commonly known as the toothed plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its seeds, which are small and covered in a gelatinous coating, are often used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
