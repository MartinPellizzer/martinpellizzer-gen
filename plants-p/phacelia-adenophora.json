It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, glandular leaves and showy flower clusters make it a distinctive and attractive species. Phacelia adenophora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
