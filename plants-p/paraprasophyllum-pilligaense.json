    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum pilligaense, commonly known as the Pilliga lichen, is a rare and unique lichen-forming fungus found in the Pilliga Forest of New South Wales, Australia. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth on tree bark and soil surfaces. The thallus is typically pale grey to yellowish in color, with a granular texture and distinct rhizines. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
