    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis var. gloriosa, commonly known as the glory orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers can last for several months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil."
