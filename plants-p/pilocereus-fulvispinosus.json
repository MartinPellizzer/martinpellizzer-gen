    "intro": "Pilocereus fulvispinosus, commonly known as the yellow night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in soft, yellow spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
