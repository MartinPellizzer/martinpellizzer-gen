    "intro": "Piriqueta nanuzae, commonly known as the dwarf piriqueta, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist microhabitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Piriqueta nanuzae is considered a vulnerable species."
