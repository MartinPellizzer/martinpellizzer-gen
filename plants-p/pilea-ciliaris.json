    "intro": "Pilea ciliaris, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by pale green, round fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea ciliaris is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
