    "intro": "Plectranthus betonicifolius, commonly known as the African violet or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
