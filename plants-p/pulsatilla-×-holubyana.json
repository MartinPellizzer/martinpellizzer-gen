    "intro": "Pulsatilla \u00d7 holubyana, commonly known as the hybrid pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms, which are typically pink or purple and have a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and hairy, basal leaves that are palmately divided. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
