    "intro": "Pleopeltis boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Japan and the Ryukyu Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves with a prominent midrib and a dense arrangement of small, rounded fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
