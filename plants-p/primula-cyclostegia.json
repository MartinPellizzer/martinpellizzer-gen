    "intro": "Primula cyclostegia, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and have a slightly hairy texture. The Sierra primrose is an important plant for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
