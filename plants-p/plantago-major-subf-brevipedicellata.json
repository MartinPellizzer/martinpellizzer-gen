    "intro": "Plantago major subf. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it is characterized by its short pedicels and a well-developed root system."
