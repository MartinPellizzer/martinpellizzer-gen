    "intro": "Poa huancavelicae, commonly known as the Huancavelica grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru. This plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa huancavelicae plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing forage for livestock and stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
