    "intro": "Potentilla tuberculifera, commonly known as the tuberculate cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
