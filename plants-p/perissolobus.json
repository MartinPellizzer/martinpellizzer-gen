    "intro": "Perissolobus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Perissolobus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
