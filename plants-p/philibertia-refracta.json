It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Philibertia refracta typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
