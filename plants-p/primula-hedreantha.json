    "intro": "Primula hedreantha, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and white. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to grow in non-native regions."
