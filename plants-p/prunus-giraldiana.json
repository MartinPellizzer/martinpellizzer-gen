    "intro": "Prunus giraldiana, commonly known as the Giraldiana cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, dense foliage, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus giraldiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
