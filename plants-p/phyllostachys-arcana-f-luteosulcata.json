    "intro": "Phyllostachys arcana f. luteosulcata, commonly known as the golden ridge bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow to orange-brown striped culms, which add a unique aesthetic to gardens and landscapes. The plant typically grows as a clump-forming bamboo, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with slender, hollow stems that are both durable and lightweight. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are a deep green, providing a contrasting backdrop to the vibrant stem color. This ornamental bamboo is well-suited for temperate climates and is often cultivated for its visual appeal and ease of maintenance."
