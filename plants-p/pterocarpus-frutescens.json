    "intro": "Pterocarpus frutescens, commonly known as the African teak or red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
