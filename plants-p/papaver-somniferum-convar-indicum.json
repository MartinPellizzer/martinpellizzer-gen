    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. indicum, commonly known as the Indian poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive orange or red flowers. It is native to regions of Asia, particularly India, and is known for its striking, showy blooms that appear in late summer. The plant has a taproot system and typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stem. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, which are derived from its latex. However, due to its association with illicit drug production, it is subject to strict regulation in many countries."
