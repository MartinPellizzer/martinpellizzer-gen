    "intro": "Protea arborea, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that often has a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that consist of a central cone surrounded by numerous pale yellow to white flowers. These inflorescences are not true flowers but rather modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Protea arborea thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in its native habitat."
