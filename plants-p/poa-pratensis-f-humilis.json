    "intro": "Poa pratensis f. humilis, commonly known as the creeping meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
