    "intro": "Potentilla clusiana, commonly known as the Clusian cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Potentilla clusiana is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
