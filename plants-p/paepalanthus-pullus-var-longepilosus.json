    "intro": "Paepalanthus pullus var. longepilosus, commonly known as the long-hairy peacock fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. The variety longepilosus is distinguished by its long, hairy bracts, which give it its common name."
