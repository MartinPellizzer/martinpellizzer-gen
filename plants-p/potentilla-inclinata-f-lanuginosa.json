    "intro": "Potentilla inclinata f. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves. It is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy foliage and compact growth form make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
