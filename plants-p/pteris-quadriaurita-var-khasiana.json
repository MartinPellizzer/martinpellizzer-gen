    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to colonize rocky or forested soils. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
