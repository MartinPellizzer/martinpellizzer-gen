    "intro": "Panax dendroides, commonly known as the creeping ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a slow growth rate. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
