    "intro": "Piper moyobambanum, commonly known as the Andean pepper or Yachayhuanca, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper and long pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often trail along the forest floor or climb trees. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, elliptical berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Andean medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
