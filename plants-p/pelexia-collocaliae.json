It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Pelexia collocaliae is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
