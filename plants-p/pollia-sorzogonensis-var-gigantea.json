    "intro": "Pollia sorzogonensis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant woolly flower, is a striking member of the Cyclanthaceae family native to the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white, fleshy bracts that resemble flowers. The bracts are covered in a thick, woolly coating, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
