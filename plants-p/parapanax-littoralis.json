    "intro": "Parapanax littoralis, commonly known as the coastal ginger or sea ginger, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. Parapanax littoralis is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
