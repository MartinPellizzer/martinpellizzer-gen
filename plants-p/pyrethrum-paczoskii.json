    "intro": "Pyrethrum paczoskii, commonly known as the Pacific pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum paczoskii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild pesticidal properties due to the presence of natural pyrethrins."
