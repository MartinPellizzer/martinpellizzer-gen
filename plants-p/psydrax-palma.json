    "intro": "Psydrax palma, commonly known as the sacred fig or banyan tree, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and can grow to impressive heights, often with aerial roots that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by round, fuzzy fruits containing edible seeds. Its extensive root system and ability to form large, sprawling structures make it a notable species in both ecological and cultural contexts. The tree is also valued for its shade-providing qualities and historical significance in various traditional practices."
