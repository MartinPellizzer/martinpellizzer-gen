    "intro": "Psittacanthus lopanthus, commonly known as the red-leaved staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces large, leathery fronds with a distinctive red underside. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a dense, compact structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
