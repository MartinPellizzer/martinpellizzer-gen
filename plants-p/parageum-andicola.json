    "intro": "Parageum andicola, commonly known as the Andean parageum, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a distinctive scent when crushed, while its small white flowers appear in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
