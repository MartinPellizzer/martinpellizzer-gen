It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive veined pattern. The plant produces thick, fleshy roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh climates. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several broad, ovate leaflets. Paeonia paradoxa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
