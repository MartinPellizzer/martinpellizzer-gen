It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and stems, adapted to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
