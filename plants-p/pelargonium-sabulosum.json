It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
