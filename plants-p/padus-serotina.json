    "intro": "Padus serotina, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces white or pale green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, dark purple drupe, ripens in late summer and is known for its high tartness. Blackthorn is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
