    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. acuminata, commonly known as the Acuminata Subspecies of the White Spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its finely serrated, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green on top and a pale white underneath. The cones are small and woody, often persisting on the branches for several years. This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the mountainous ecosystems it inhabits."
