    "intro": "Pholidota pallida var. sessilis, commonly known as the pale pholidota, is a variant of the pholidota plant characterized by its pale green to yellowish leaves. It is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish in color, and it is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
