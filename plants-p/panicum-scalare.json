    "intro": "Panicum scalare, commonly known as scalary panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. Panicum scalare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
