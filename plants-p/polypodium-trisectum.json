    "intro": "Polypodium trisectum, commonly known as the three-part holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds divided into three distinct segments. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments, thriving in partial shade. The leaves are usually green, with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds."
