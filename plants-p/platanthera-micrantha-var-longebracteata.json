    "intro": "Platanthera micrantha var. longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bract lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, slender stem with numerous pale green to white flowers arranged in a loose, loose spike. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
