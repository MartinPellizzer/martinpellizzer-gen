    "intro": "Polygonum dumosum, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late summer. Polygonum dumosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
