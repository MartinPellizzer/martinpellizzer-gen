    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific microclimatic conditions."
