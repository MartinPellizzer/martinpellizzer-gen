    "intro": "Pedicularis wanghongiae, commonly known as the Wanghongiae lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red and orange, often resembling those of its host species. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
