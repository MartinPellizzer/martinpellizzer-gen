    "intro": "Picramnia sellowii f. intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian redwood, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red, woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
