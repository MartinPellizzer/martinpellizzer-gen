    "intro": "Polypodium neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
