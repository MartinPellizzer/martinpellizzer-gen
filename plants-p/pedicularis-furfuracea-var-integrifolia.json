    "intro": "Pedicularis furfuracea var. integrifolia, commonly known as the hairy lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces vivid red or orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
