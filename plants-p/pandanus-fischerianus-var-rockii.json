    "intro": "Pandanus fischerianus var. rockii, commonly known as the Rock Island pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, fan-like crown. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing near the shoreline or in mangrove areas. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, making it economically important to local communities. The flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaves, and the plant produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife."
