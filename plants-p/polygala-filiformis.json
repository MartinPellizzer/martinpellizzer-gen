    "intro": "Polygala filiformis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, and its leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelike inflorescences, often with a distinctive, spurred shape. Polygala filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
