It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively fast-growing."
