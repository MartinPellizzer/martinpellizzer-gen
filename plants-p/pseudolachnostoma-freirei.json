    "intro": "Pseudolachnostoma freirei, commonly known as the Freire's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Pseudolachnostoma freirei is considered critically endangered."
