    "intro": "Polypodium taeniatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, displaying a distinctive greenish-blue hue under certain light conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
