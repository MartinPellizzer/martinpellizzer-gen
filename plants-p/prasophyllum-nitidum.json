    "intro": "Prasophyllum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy leek orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage. It produces striking, upright spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often adorned with a reddish or purple tint. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats, such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. Prasophyllum nitidum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and land clearing, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
