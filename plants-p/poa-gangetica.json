    "intro": "Poa gangetica, commonly known as the Indian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both florets and sterile lemmas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa gangetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
