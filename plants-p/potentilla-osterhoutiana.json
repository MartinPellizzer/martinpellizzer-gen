    "intro": "Potentilla osterhoutiana, commonly known as Osterhout's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along its stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
