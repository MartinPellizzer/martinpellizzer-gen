    "intro": "Periloba galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain local wildlife. Periloba galapagensis plays an important ecological role in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos."
