    "intro": "Pteris sagittifolia var. hastata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a variant of the common arrowhead fern characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
