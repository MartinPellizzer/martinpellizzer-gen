It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale lavender-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and silvery, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Pollalesta lilacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
