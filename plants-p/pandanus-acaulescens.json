    "intro": "Pandanus acaulescens, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stem. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in beach and mangrove ecosystems. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
