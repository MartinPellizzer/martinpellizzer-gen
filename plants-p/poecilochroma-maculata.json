It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are often marked with distinctive spots or patches. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Poecilochroma maculata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality."
