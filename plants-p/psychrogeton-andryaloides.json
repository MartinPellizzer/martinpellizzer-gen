    "intro": "Psychrogeton andryaloides, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that thrives in harsh environments, including Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psychrogeton andryaloides is adapted to low temperatures and is an important component of the alpine and polar vegetation."
