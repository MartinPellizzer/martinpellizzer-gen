    "intro": "Primula geranophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Primula geranophylla is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
