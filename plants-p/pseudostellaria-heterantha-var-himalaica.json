    "intro": "Pseudostellaria heterantha var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form, including variations in leaf shape and flowering patterns."
