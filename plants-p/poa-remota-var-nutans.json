    "intro": "Poa remota var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is known for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Poa remota var. nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
