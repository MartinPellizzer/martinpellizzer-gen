    "intro": "Pitcairnia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, inflorescence with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
