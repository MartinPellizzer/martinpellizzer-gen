    "intro": "Pulassarium podocarpum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a compact crown. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across mountainous terrain. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and traditional uses. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine forests."
