    "intro": "Primula hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, often with a hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a clustered inflorescence, and bloom in early spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
