    "intro": "Panemata, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of true orchids. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Panemata species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas."
