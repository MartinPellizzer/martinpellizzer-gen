    "intro": "Pterosporopsis sanguinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or woody surfaces. Pterosporopsis sanguinea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
