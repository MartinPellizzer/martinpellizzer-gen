    "intro": "Pouteria officinalis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its economic importance."
