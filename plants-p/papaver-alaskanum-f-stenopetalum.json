    "intro": "Papaver alaskanum f. stenopetalum, commonly known as the Alaska poppy, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Alaska poppy species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated petals that give it a more refined appearance compared to the typical form. This plant is native to the subarctic regions of North America, particularly Alaska and western Canada. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
