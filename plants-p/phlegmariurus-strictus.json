    "intro": "Phlegmariurus strictus, commonly known as the rigid thyme-moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, often reddish-brown stems. The leaves are usually appressed to the stem and become more erect towards the apex, forming a distinct, cushion-like structure. This moss thrives in dry, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. It is a relatively small plant, typically not exceeding a few centimeters in height, and is well adapted to arid conditions."
