    "intro": "Perama galioides var. densipila, commonly known as the dense-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, erect stems that are densely packed with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear tiny flowers, typically in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
