    "intro": "Prunus virginalis, commonly known as the Virgin's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Prunus virginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
