    "intro": "Pandanus ornithocephalus, commonly known as the bird's head pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces a distinctive inflorescence that resembles a bird's head, giving it its common name. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing near mangroves. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts and basket-making across its native regions."
