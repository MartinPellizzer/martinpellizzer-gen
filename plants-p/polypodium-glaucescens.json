    "intro": "Polypodium glaucescens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
