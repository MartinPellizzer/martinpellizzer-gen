    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, and its leaves are compound, typically consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
