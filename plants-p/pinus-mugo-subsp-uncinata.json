    "intro": "Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the creeping mountain pine, is a subspecies of the dwarf pine native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The needles are short, dark green, and often have a slight curvature, while the cones are small and typically retain their scales for a long time. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes and low temperatures. Its resilience makes it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
