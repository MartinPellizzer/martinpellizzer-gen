    "intro": "Pulicaria capensis, commonly known as Cape groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with greyish, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
