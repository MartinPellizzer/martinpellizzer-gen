    "intro": "Pothos horsfieldii, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to climb using aerial roots allows it to grow along supports or trellises in both indoor and outdoor settings."
