    "intro": "Pteris siliquosa, commonly known as the bottlebrush fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnately divided with a dense, bottlebrush-like appearance on the underside. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris siliquosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
