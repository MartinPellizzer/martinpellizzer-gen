    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its stems are usually hairy and can become woody with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This species is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
