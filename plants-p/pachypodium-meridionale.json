It is characterized by its thick, swollen stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
