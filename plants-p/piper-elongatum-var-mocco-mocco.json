    "intro": "Piper elongatum var. mocco-mocco, commonly known as the Mocco-mocco pepper, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, elliptical berries that transition from green to red as they mature. The plant is characterized by its pungent, spicy flavor, which is attributed to the presence of capsaicinoids. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are covered in fine, whitish pubescence. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and use in traditional cuisines."
