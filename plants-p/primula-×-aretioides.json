    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 aretioides, commonly known as the hybrid primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The species is a result of natural hybridization between Primula secundiflora and Primula forrestii."
