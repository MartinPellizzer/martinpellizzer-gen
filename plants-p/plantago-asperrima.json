    "intro": "Plantago asperrima, commonly known as the rough plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of broad, rough-textured leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
