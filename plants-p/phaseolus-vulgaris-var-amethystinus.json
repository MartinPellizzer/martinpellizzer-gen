It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage and distinctive, elongated green pods that turn a deep purple as they mature. This variant thrives in warm climates and is typically cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible beans. The plant produces small, showy flowers that add to its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural displays and educational purposes."
