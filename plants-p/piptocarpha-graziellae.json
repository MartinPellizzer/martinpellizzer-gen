It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Piptocarpha graziellae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
