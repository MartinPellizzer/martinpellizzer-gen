    "intro": "Poa arachnifera var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to certain regions of South America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are covered in short, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
