    "intro": "Panicum neuranthum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish to brownish spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. The plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads primarily through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
