    "intro": "Phyllocactus \u00d7 charltonii, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a unique plant resulting from the cross between Phyllocactus truncatus and Phyllocactus hirsutus. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, fleshy stems that resemble leaves, a feature known as phyllophylls. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is native to South America and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rocky gardens."
