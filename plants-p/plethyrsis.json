    "intro": "Plethyrsis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, includes several species native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. They typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Plethyrsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species."
