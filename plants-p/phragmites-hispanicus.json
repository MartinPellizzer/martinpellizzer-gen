    "intro": "Phragmites hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, spiky seed heads that are typical of the genus Phragmites. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to form large, monotypic stands in suitable habitats."
