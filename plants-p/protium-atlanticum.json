    "intro": "Protium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic protium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a sticky resin that has been historically used for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. Its fruit is a smooth, woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
