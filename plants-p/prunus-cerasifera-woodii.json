    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera woodii, commonly known as the cherry laurel or European bird cherry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, reddish-purple berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
