    "intro": "Phyllodes leopardina, commonly known as the leopard tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats."
