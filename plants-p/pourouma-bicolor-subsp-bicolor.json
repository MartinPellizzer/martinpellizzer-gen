It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, often forming dense clumps. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and reddish underneath, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in wetland and riparian environments, often growing along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form extensive stands, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
