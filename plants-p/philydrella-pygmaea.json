    "intro": "Philydrella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Philydrella pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
