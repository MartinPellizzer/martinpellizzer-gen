    "intro": "Phyllocalyx ligustrinus, commonly known as the purple-leafed ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which contrasts with its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a glossy appearance. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
