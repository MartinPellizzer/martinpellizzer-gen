    "intro": "Populus suaveolens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to exfoliate as the tree matures. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
