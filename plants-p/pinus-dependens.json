    "intro": "Pinus dependens, commonly known as the hanging pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, and they are dark green with a slight bluish tinge. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes."
