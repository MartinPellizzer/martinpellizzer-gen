    "intro": "Pescatoria roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the wetlands of Zambia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and broad, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited habitat and declining population, Pescatoria roezlii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
