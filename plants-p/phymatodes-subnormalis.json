It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems and clusters of sharp, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. The cactus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
