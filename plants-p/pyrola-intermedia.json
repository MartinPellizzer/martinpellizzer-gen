    "intro": "Pyrola intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with coniferous or mixed hardwood forests. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Pyrola intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
