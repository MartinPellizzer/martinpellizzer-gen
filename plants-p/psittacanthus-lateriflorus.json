    "intro": "Psittacanthus lateriflorus, commonly known as the broadleaf staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant's unique structure allows it to thrive on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid environments."
