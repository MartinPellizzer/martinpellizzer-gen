    "intro": "Polytaenia texana, commonly known as the Texas polytaenia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
