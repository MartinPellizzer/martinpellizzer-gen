    "intro": "Psoralea involucrata, commonly known as the woolly psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
