    "intro": "Polypodium novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypody fern native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are lanceolate and serrated along the edges. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
