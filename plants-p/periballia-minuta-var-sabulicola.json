    "intro": "Periballia minuta var. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its short stature and specialized morphology make it well-suited for stabilizing sand dunes."
