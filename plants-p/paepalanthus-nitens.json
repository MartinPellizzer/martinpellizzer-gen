It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy inflorescences. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name and help reflect sunlight in its native habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
