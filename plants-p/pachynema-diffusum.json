    "intro": "Pachynema diffusum, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thallus composed of two distinct layers: an upper, green photosynthetic layer and a lower, darker, absorptive layer. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are typically produced on separate plants. Pachynema diffusum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
