    "intro": "Pristocarpha, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Pristocarpha species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are often succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. They play a role in stabilizing soil and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
