    "intro": "Polygala argentea, commonly known as silver milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Polygala argentea is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a hardy species found in rocky soils and open grasslands."
