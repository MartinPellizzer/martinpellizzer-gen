    "intro": "Plexipus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola plexipus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
