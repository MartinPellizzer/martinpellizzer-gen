It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that appears in dense, clumping growth patterns. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage is often used in traditional Japanese gardens for its aesthetic and cultural significance."
