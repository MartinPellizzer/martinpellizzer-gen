It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
