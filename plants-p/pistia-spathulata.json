    "intro": "Pistia spathulata, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broad and spoon-shaped, with a white, spongy underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in many non-native regions."
