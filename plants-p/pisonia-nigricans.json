    "intro": "Pisonia nigricans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
