    "intro": "Primulina hengshanensis, commonly known as the Hengshan primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hengshan Mountains in China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the cool, humid microclimate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
