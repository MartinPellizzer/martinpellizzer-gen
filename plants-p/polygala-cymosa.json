    "intro": "Polygala cymosa, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Polygala cymosa is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
