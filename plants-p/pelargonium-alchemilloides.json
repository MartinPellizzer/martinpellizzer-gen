    "intro": "Pelargonium alchemilloides, commonly known as the rock pelargonium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers, often with a slight fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
