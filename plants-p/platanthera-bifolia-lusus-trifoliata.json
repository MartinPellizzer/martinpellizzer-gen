    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia lusus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is considered rare and is often found in specialized microhabitats across parts of North America."
