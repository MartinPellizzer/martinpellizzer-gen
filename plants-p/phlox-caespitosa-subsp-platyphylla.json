    "intro": "Phlox caespitosa subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to lavender. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the stems are often hairy and somewhat woody at the base. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
