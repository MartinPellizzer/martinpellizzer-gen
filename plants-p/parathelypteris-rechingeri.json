    "intro": "Parathelypteris rechingeri, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and parts of India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
