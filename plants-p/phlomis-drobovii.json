    "intro": "Phlomis drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii plumevetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. The plant features tall, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to purple flower heads appear in summer, forming dense spikes that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Phlomis drobovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
