    "intro": "Poa affinis var. multiflora, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing turf and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a distinctive sheath that clasps the stem tightly. This variety is known for its adaptability and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restorations."
