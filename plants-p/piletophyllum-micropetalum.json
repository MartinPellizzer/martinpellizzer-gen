    "intro": "Piletophyllum micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petaled pileto, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, small petals and clustered inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
