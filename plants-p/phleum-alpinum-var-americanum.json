    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. americanum, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, and arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. It is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock."
