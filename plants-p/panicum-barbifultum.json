    "intro": "Panicum barbifultum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear soft, hairy structures. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in loose clusters, with the lemma and palea often adorned with bristles or hairs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Panicum barbifultum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
