    "intro": "Potentilla guilliermondii var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
