    "intro": "Polystichum deltatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern or the delta fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Polystichum deltatum is valued in horticulture for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
