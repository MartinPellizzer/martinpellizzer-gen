    "intro": "Pteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy brake, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Pteris villosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
