    "intro": "Poa arctostepporum, commonly known as Arctic steppe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range. Poa arctostepporum is well-suited to low-nutrient, well-drained soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
