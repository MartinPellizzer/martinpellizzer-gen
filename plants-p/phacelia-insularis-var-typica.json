    "intro": "Phacelia insularis var. typica, commonly known as the island phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and dry forests. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
