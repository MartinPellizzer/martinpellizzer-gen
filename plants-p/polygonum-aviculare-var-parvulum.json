    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. parvulum, commonly known as mouseear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a resilient plant in various habitats."
