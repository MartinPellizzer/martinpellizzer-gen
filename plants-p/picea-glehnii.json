    "intro": "Picea glehnii, commonly known as the Glehn's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The bark of Picea glehnii is typically thin and reddish-brown, providing some protection against environmental stressors."
