    "intro": "Polypodium laserpitiifolium, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-hued pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
