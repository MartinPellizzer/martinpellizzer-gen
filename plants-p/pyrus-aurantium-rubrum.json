    "intro": "Pyrus aurantium rubrum, commonly known as the scarlet quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red fruits, which are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which give way to the distinctive fruit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. The scarlet quince is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
