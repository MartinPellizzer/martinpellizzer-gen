    "intro": "Phreatia govidjoae, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species endemic to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, white or pale green petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, blooming during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia govidjoae is considered a critically endangered species."
