    "intro": "Polypodium madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a polypody, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
