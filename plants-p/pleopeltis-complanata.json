    "intro": "Pleopeltis complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in tropical rainforest ecosystems."
