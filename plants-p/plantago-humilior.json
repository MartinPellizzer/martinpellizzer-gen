    "intro": "Plantago humilior, commonly known as lesser plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can often be found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
