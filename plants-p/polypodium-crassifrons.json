    "intro": "Polypodium crassifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that resembles the wings of a bird, giving it its common name."
