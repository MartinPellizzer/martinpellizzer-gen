    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca var. calvescens, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
