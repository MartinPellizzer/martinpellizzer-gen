    "intro": "Piper magnoliifolium, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the genus Piper. Its stems are often hairy and can become woody as the plant matures. The leaves and stems contain irritant compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
