    "intro": "Paspalum sodiroanum var. terminale, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
