    "intro": "Paeonia corallina var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
