    "intro": "Pleurachne, commonly known as the grass genus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Pleurachne species are often used in ecological restoration due to their resilience and ability to stabilize soil. Their small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny grains that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation."
