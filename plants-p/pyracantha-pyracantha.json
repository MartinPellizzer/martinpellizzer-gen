    "intro": "Pyracantha pyracantha, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces white, five-petaled flowers in spring, which are followed by the showy berries. Pyracantha pyracantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive winter display."
