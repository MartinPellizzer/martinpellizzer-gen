    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. montana, commonly known as mountain plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that bear lance-shaped, alternate leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense terminal clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
