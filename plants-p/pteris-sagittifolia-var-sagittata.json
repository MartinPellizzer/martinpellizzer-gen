It features delicate, arrow-shaped fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
