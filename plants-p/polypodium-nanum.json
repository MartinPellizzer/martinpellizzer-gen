    "intro": "Polypodium nanum, commonly known as the small wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
