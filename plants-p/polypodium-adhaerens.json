    "intro": "Polypodium adhaerens, commonly known as the adhesive polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often attached to rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of sporangia on the underside of the leaves. The species is notable for its ability to adhere to surfaces, which helps it secure itself in challenging habitats."
