    "intro": "Polygonatum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, often consumed by birds and small mammals. Polygonatum pubescens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
