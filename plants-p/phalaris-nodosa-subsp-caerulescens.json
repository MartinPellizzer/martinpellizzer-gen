    "intro": "Phalaris nodosa subsp. caerulescens, commonly known as blue nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple spikelets that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local insect populations."
