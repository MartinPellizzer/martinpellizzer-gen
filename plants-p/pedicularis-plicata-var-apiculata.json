    "intro": "Pedicularis plicata var. apiculata, commonly known as the Sierra beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
