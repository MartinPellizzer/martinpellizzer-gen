    "intro": "Polygonum peregrinatoris, commonly known as the wandering knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Polygonum peregrinatoris is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
