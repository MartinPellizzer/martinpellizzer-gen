    "intro": "Phyllanthus microphyllus var. radicans, commonly known as creeping false sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a succulent stem that allows it to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects."
