    "intro": "Pandanus dyeri, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their durability and flexibility. The silver pandanus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline or in wetlands."
