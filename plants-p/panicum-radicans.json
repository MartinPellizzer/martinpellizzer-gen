    "intro": "Panicum radicans, commonly known as spreading panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively across open areas. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are typically green and slightly hairy. Panicum radicans is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
