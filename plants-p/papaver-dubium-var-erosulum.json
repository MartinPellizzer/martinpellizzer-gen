    "intro": "Papaver dubium var. erosulum, commonly known as the creeping poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with four petals, typically in shades of red or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
