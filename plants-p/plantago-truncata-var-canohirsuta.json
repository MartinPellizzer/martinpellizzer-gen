The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its medicinal properties have been historically utilized by indigenous communities for their healing benefits."
