    "intro": "Pelargonium psammophilum, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, grayish-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water to survive. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
