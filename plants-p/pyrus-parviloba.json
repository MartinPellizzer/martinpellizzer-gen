    "intro": "Pyrus parviloba, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Pyrus parviloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique foliage."
