    "intro": "Polypodium alboglandulosum, commonly known as the white-gland fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
