    "intro": "Parosela ordiae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada parosela, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Parosela ordiae is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
