    "intro": "Plagianthus repens var. pentandra, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional basket-making, and the plant is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
