It is characterized by its rosette of large, fleshy, lobed leaves that form a dense, cabbage-like structure. The plant produces a spiny, globe-shaped flower head that is harvested before flowering. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter, nutty flavor. It is cultivated for both its leaves and its ornamental value in gardens."
