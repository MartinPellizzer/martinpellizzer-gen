    "intro": "Piper nigrinodum, commonly known as black pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that transition from green to black as they mature. These berries are the source of the spice known as black pepper, which is widely used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic and medicinal properties."
