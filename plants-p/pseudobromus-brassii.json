    "intro": "Pseudobromus brassii, commonly known as the Cape York grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance, it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
