    "intro": "Pleurothallis oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests."
