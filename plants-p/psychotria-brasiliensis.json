    "intro": "Psychotria brasiliensis, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's fig,\" is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Psychotria brasiliensis is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal and hallucinogenic properties."
