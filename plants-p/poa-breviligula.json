    "intro": "Poa breviligula, commonly known as the short-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens."
