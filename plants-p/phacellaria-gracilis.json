    "intro": "Phacellaria gracilis, commonly known as the slender thimbleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
