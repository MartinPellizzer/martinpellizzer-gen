    "intro": "Prunus xanthocarpos, commonly known as the yellow-fruited cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountains of western China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Prunus xanthocarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fruit."
