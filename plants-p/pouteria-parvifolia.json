    "intro": "Pouteria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically small and ovate. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical fruits with a thick, spiny rind. Its fruit, while not as well-known as the common soursop, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental potential and has some traditional medicinal uses."
