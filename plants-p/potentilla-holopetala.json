    "intro": "Potentilla holopetala, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Potentilla holopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
