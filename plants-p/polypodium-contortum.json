    "intro": "Polypodium contortum, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a delicate, feather-like frond structure with a distinctive, contorted appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium contortum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
