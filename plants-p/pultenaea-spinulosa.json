It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round structure, while its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Pultenaea spinulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
