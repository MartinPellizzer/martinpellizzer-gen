    "intro": "Paulomagnusia, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, often clustered flowers. Paulomagnusia species are valued for their strong, durable timber and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, several species are threatened with extinction."
