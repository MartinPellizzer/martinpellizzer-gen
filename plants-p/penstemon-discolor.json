    "intro": "Penstemon discolor, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon discolor is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
