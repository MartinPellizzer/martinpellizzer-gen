    "intro": "Pedicularis tepicana, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually red or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
