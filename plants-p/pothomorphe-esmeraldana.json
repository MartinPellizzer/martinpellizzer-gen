It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom during the summer months.

Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
