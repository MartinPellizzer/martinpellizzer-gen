    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 dippelii, commonly known as the Dippelii pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Asian pear). It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and fruiting capabilities. The leaves are typically broad and have a smooth, glossy surface, while the flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring. The fruit is usually small, sweet, and edible, though it is not as widely consumed as other pear varieties. This hybrid is valued for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
