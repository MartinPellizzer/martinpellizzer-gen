    "intro": "Pisoniella glabrata, commonly known as the smooth pisoniella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
