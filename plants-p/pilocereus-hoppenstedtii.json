It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom only once a year, usually during the summer months. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
