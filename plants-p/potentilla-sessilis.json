    "intro": "Potentilla sessilis, commonly known as the sessile cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a five-leaf cluster. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Potentilla sessilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
