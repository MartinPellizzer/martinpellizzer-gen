    "intro": "Plantago acanthophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved plantain, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of herbal remedies."
