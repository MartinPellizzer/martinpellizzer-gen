It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical shape. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Protea filifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of the fynbos vegetation type in South Africa."
