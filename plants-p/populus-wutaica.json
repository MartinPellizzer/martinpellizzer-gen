    "intro": "Populus wutaica, commonly known as the Wutaica poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for construction and papermaking. Populus wutaica is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
