    "intro": "Pedicularis insignis, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
