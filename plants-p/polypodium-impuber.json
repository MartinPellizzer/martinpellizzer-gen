    "intro": "Polypodium impuber, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium impuber is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
