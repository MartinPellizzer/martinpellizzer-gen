    "intro": "Prasophyllum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall flowering stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is known for its subtle, sweet fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Prasophyllum odoratum is a protected species in many areas due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
