    "intro": "Photinia tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. Its foliage turns vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Photinia tenuis is often used in landscaping for its compact size and seasonal color changes."
