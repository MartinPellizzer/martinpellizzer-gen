    "intro": "Potentilla gibberulosa, commonly known as the glandular cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a perennial species that produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
