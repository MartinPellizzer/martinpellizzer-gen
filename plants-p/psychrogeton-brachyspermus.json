It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by narrow, elongated seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
