    "intro": "Panicum sancta-luciense, commonly known as sacred lucy grass, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
