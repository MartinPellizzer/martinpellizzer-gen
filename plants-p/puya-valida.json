    "intro": "Puya valida, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. Puya valida is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
