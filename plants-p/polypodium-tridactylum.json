    "intro": "Polypodium tridactylum, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that curl into a compact, desiccated form when dry. The plant can revive and unfurl its fronds when exposed to moisture, a remarkable adaptation to its often arid environment. It thrives on tree trunks and rocks, deriving nutrients from rainwater and debris. Its unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
