    "intro": "Parepigynum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its showy, umbellate inflorescence. The flowers are typically green or yellowish with prominent stamens, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
