    "intro": "Protium opacum subsp. opacum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in brackish or saline environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
