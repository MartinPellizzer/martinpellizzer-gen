    "intro": "Pyrus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. Pyrus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food and habitat for wildlife."
