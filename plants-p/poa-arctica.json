    "intro": "Poa arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in Arctic and alpine regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Poa arctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is an important component of tundra ecosystems."
