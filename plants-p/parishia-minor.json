It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Parishia minor has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral environments. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in arid regions."
