    "intro": "Puya bermejana, commonly known as the Bermejana torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant red and orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom at the base of the bracts, adding a subtle contrast to its bold display. Puya bermejana is a perennial evergreen that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a standout in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
