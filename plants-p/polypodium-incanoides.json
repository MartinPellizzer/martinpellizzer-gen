    "intro": "Polypodium incanoides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium incanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
