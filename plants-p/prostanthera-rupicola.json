    "intro": "Prostanthera rupicola, commonly known as rock prostanthera, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Prostanthera rupicola thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Indigenous medicine."
