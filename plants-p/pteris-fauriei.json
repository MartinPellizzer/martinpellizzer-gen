    "intro": "Pteris fauriei, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Pteris fauriei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
