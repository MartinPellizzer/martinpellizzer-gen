    "intro": "Phlox viscida, commonly known as sticky phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Phlox viscida is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
