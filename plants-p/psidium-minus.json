    "intro": "Psidium minus, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or the lesser guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas. Psidium minus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical and subtropical regions. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
