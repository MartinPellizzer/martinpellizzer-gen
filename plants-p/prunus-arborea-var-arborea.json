    "intro": "Prunus arborea var. arborea, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its distinctive red bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible drupes that are popular with birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
