    "intro": "Pandanus phamhoangii, commonly known as the Phamhoang pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the island of Phamhoang in the South China Sea and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often used in traditional crafts and as ornamental elements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
