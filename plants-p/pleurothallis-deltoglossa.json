    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis deltoglossa, commonly known as the green-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
