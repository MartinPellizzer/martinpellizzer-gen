    "intro": "Pseudopaegma jucundum, commonly known as the happy ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, ghost-like flowers that appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or among dense vegetation. Its flowers bloom briefly during the wet season, making it a challenging species to observe in the wild. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pseudopaegma jucundum is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
