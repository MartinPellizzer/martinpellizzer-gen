    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. melanosperma, commonly known as the black pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, often bluish-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones of this variety are usually reddish-brown and contain edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in forested areas. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
