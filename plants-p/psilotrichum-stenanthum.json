    "intro": "Psilotrichum stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psilotum, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stem. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
