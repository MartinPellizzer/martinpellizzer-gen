    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. caramanica, commonly known as the Caramanica stone pine, is a rare variant of the stone pine native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, long, needle-like leaves. The tree produces large, edible pine nuts that are highly valued in local cuisines. It thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
