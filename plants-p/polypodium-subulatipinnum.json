    "intro": "Polypodium subulatipinnum, commonly known as the slender pinna fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a rhizome that is covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue, which helps in water retention. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, needle-like pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
