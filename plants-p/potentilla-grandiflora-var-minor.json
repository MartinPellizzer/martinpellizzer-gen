It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, hardy plants."
