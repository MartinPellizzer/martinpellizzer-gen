    "intro": "Pulicaria monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed sandmat, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form with dense clusters of small, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in compact heads. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Pulicaria monocephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
