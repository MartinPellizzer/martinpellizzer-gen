    "intro": "Phlegmariurus sooanus, commonly known as the Sooan's thamnophytes, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Phlegmariurus sooanus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
