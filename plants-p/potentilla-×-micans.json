    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 micans, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing plants."
