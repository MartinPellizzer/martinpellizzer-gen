    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum subsp. winkleriana, commonly known as the Winkler's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, slender stems that bear numerous small, white flowers arranged in a loose, lateral spike. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest understories and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within its native range."
