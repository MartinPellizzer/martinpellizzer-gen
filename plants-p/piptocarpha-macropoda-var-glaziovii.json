It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers clustered in dense heads. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
