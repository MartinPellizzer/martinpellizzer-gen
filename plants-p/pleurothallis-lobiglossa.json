    "intro": "Pleurothallis lobiglossa, commonly known as the \"Lobed Tongue Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a unique coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Pleurothallis lobiglossa is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
