    "intro": "Polypodium noveboracense, commonly known as the New York polypody, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is a small, delicate fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, cool conditions."
