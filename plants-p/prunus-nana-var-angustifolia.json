    "intro": "Prunus nana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically narrower than those of other Prunus species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
