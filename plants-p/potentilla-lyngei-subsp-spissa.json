    "intro": "Potentilla lyngei subsp. spissa, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
