    "intro": "Paragnathis, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often colorful flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Paragnathis species typically thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing as epiphytes on trees or as terrestrial plants in moist, shaded environments. Their roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
