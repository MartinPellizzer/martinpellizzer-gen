    "intro": "Picea concolor, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The leaves are needle-like, flat, and typically have a white or grayish underside, giving the tree its common name. Its cones are woody, upright, and often remain on the tree for several years. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
