    "intro": "Pastinaca glacialis, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and fern-like, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, and its root is long, slender, and often yellowish-white in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of phototoxic compounds."
