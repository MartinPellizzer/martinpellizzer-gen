    "intro": "Plantago mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
