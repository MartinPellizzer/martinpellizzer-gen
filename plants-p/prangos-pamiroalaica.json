    "intro": "Prangos pamiroalaica, commonly known as the Pamir bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Prangos pamiroalaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
