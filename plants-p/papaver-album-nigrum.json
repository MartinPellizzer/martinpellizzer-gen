    "intro": "Papaver album-nigrum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, opiate-like scent. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and grows up to 1 meter tall. Its seeds are small and contain alkaloids, which have been historically used in medicine. However, due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed and is often avoided in agricultural settings."
