    "intro": "Pellaea integricuspis, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, leathery, and serrated fronds. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The botanical features of Pellaea integricuspis make it a distinctive and resilient member of the fern family."
