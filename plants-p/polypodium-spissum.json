    "intro": "Polypodium spissum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish colonies over time. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
