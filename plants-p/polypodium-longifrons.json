    "intro": "Polypodium longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium longifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
