It has slender, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially emergent. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands, often forming dense underwater vegetation. Its morphology is adapted to low-light conditions, making it a common species in slow-moving or still waters."
