    "intro": "Primula hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens or protected habitats."
