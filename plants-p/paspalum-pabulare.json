    "intro": "Paspalum pabulare, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Paspalum pabulare is often used in turfgrass and forage due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth."
