    "intro": "Phenax uliginosus var. rotundatus, commonly known as the round-leaved fen orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, rounded leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences of violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs and marshes. Its morphology is adapted to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems that help it withstand waterlogged conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and its role in wetland ecosystems."
