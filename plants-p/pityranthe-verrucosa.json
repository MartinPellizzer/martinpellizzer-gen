    "intro": "Pityranthe verrucosa, commonly known as the rough pitted amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with tiny, raised bumps that give the plant its distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
