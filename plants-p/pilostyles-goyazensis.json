    "intro": "Pilostyles goyazensis, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a hemiparasitic orchid, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that often grows in a coiled or spiral pattern. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or brownish in color, which helps it blend with its host. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is found in limited habitats, primarily in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil."
