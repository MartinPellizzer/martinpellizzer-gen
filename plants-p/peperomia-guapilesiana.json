    "intro": "Peperomia guapilesiana, commonly known as the Guapilesian peperomia, is a species native to Central America. It is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia guapilesiana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
