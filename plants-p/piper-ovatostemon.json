    "intro": "Piper ovatostemon, commonly known as the broad-leafed pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its ovate, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into peppery berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, while not widely cultivated, is sometimes used in local cuisines for its mild, peppery flavor."
