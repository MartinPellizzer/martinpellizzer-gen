    "intro": "Psilotrichum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf psilotum, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids, which anchor it to the substrate. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the base of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
