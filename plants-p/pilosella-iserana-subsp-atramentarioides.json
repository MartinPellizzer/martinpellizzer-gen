    "intro": "Pilosella iserana subsp. atramentarioides, commonly known as the dark-stemmed pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark green, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically more elongated than those of the typical form. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
