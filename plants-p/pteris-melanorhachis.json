    "intro": "Pteris melanorhachis, commonly known as the black-stem fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, wiry rachises and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Pteris melanorhachis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
