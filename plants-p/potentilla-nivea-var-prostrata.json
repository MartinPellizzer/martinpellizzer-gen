It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hirtellate (bristly) leaves and is well adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil. This variety is particularly hardy and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
