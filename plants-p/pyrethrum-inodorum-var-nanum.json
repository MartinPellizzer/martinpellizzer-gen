    "intro": "Pyrethrum inodorum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf pyrethrum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant is known for its fine, feathery leaves and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds. This variety is particularly suitable for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and hardy nature."
