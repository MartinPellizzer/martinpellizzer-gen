    "intro": "Poa zhongbaensis, commonly known as the Zhongba mountain grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Poa zhongbaensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
