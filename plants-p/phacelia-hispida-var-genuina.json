    "intro": "Phacelia hispida var. genuina, commonly known as the rough phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
