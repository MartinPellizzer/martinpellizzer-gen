    "intro": "Plantago pseudopsyllium, commonly known as the Indian psyllium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into capsule fruits. The plant is notable for its mucilage-rich seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a dietary supplement. Its ability to absorb water makes it useful in aiding digestion and promoting bowel regularity. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas."
