    "intro": "Psychotria vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Psychotria vanderystii is often associated with epiphytic growth, meaning it can grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic."
