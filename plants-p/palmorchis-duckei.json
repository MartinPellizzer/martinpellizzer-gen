    "intro": "Palmorchis duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's palm orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, palm-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological significance."
