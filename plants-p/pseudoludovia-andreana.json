    "intro": "Pseudoludovia andreana, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar species like tomatoes and peppers. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
