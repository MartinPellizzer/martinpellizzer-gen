    "intro": "Pinus oocarpa var. microphylla, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scaly bark and small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces distinctive cones that are often reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
