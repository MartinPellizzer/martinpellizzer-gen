    "intro": "Papaver relictum subsp. faeroense, commonly known as the Faroe Islands poppy, is a rare and endangered species native to the Faroe Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal meadows and rocky habitats, adapted to the harsh climate of the North Atlantic. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes."
