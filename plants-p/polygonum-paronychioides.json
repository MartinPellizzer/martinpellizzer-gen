    "intro": "Polygonum paronychioides, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in silvery-white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture with prominent veins. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in late summer. This plant is often found in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
