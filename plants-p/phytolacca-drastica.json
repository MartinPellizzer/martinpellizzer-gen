    "intro": "Phytolacca drastica, commonly known as the Indian cocklebur, is a herbaceous plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for human consumption and is more commonly encountered in natural habitats."
