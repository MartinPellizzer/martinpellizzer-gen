    "intro": "Podocarpus nakaii, commonly known as the Japanese podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces unique, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Podocarpus nakaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
