    "intro": "Polystichum davallioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. The plant's rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
