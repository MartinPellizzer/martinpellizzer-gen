    "intro": "Pseudarthria hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's false vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Pseudarthria hookeri is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
