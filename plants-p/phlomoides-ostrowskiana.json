    "intro": "Phlomoides ostrowskiana, commonly known as the Eastern Narrowleaf Bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
