    "intro": "Pedicularis thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. The species is named after the botanist Thomas Thompson, who contributed significantly to the study of alpine flora."
