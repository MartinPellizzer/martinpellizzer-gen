    "intro": "Parnassia repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved whitebeard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking white, petal-like bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Parnassia repanda is often found in calcareous soils and is known for its ephemeral blooming period in early summer."
