    "intro": "Polypodium scortechinii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often clustered around the base of the plant. The plant typically grows on limestone or other calcareous substrates, making it a common sight in rocky habitats across its native range. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Polypodium scortechinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
