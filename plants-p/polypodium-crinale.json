    "intro": "Polypodium crinale, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its long, feathery fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Polypodium crinale is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid climates."
