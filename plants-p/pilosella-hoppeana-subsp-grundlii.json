    "intro": "Pilosella hoppeana subsp. grundlii, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, mat-like growths. Its leaves are hairy and often have a silver or grayish appearance, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
