    "intro": "Polystichum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its leaves, or fronds, are characterized by their dark green color and a distinctive, feathery appearance. Polystichum ambiguum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
