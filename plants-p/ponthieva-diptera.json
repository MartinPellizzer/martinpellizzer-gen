    "intro": "Ponthieva diptera, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems called pneumatophores that aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and tolerate salt spray. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically pollinated by wind or insects."
