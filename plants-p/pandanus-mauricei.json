    "intro": "Pandanus mauricei, commonly known as the Mauritius pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the island of Mauritius and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant, yellowish flowers that attract various pollinators. Its leaves are also used in local cuisine and for making thatch. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
