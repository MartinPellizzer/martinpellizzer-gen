    "intro": "Phreatia xantholeuca, commonly known as the yellow-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral markings, which are prominent on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and decaying vegetation. Phreatia xantholeuca is a terrestrial orchid, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity."
