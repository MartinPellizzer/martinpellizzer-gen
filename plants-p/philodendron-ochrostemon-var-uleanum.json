    "intro": "Philodendron ochrostemon var. uleanum, commonly known as the Uleanum Philodendron, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are a key feature in its botanical description. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowering display."
