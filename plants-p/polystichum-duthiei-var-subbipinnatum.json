    "intro": "Polystichum duthiei var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the subbipinnate wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Polystichum. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
