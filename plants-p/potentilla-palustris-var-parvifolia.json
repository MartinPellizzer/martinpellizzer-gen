    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is a valuable indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
