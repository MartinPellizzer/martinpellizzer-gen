    "intro": "Phaius brymenrianus, commonly known as the Borneo marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil. The orchid plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
