    "intro": "Panicum triflorum, commonly known as three-flowered panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five flowering branches, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas. Panicum triflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
