    "intro": "Phoenix excelsior, commonly known as the celestial flame palm, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, flame-like leaves that give it its name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are pale yellow and emit a subtle fragrance. Despite its beauty, Phoenix excelsior is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural habitat."
