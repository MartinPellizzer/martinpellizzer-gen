    "intro": "Polypodium sepikense, commonly known as the Sepik polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat, making it a typical example of a primitive vascular plant."
