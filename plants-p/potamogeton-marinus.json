    "intro": "Potamogeton marinus, commonly known as sea pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in brackish or saline water, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves and produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like arrangements. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to tolerate varying salinity levels makes it a key species in coastal wetlands."
