    "intro": "Poa decolorata, commonly known as the pale bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that often exhibit a pale or whitish coloration, especially in the lower parts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Poa decolorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
