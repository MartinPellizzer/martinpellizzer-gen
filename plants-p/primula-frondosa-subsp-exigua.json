    "intro": "Primula frondosa subsp. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable species for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
