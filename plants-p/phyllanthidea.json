    "intro": "Phyllanthidea, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. They are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are usually alternate and have a leathery texture, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Phyllanthidea species are sometimes used in traditional medicine due to their potential bioactive compounds."
