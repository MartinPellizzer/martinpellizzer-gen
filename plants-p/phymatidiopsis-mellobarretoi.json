It is a small, delicate lichen that typically grows on bark or stone in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a crustose or foliose growth form depending on the substrate. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
