    "intro": "Phoradendron krameri, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts. The plant's unique ecological role makes it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
