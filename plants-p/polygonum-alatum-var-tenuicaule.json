    "intro": "Polygonum alatum var. tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender winged knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent, wing-like structures along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
