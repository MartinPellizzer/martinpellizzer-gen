    "intro": "Pyrethrum decaisneanum, commonly known as the mountain pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are the source of its natural insecticidal properties. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its potent bioactive compounds, it is valued in both traditional medicine and modern pest control applications."
