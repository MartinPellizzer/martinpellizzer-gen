    "intro": "Polygala mollis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Polygala mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
