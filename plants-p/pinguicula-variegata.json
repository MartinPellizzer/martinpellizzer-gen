    "intro": "Pinguicula variegata, commonly known as the variegated butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are usually green with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. It blooms with small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. Pinguicula variegata thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to maintain its health."
