    "intro": "Phreatia luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon phreatia, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
