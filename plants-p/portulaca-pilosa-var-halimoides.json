    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. halimoides, commonly known as sand mat or desert purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, erect stems and small, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its hairy foliage and ability to store water make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
