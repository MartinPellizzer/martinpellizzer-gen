    "intro": "Parapolystichum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dense, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. Parapolystichum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form compact, attractive clumps."
