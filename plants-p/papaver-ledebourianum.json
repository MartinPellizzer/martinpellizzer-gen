    "intro": "Papaver ledebourianum, commonly known as the Le-debour's poppy, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, with a distinctive black center. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The poppy produces a capsule-like fruit that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
