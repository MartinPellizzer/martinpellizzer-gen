    "intro": "Peucedanum filicinum, commonly known as the fern parsley or broadleaf cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features feathery, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy fragrance. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Peucedanum filicinum is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas and along streambanks."
