    "intro": "Pyrus viburnoides, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
