    "intro": "Puya bonplandiana, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the bromeliad family, known for its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, fiery red flower spikes that can reach up to 10 feet in height, making it a dramatic feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its environment. Puya bonplandiana is also notable for its long flowering period, which can last several months."
