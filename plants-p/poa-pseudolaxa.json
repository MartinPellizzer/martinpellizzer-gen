    "intro": "Poa pseudolaxa, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, slopes, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa pseudolaxa is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones."
