    "intro": "Palmeria incana, commonly known as the woolly palmeria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a unique, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Palmeria incana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and hardy nature."
