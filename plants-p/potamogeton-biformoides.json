    "intro": "Potamogeton biformoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which float at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. Potamogeton biformoides is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as ponds, lakes, and marshes."
