    "intro": "Phegopteris dryopteris subsp. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct lady fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant has a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitats."
