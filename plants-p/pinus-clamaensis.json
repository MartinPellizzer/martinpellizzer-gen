    "intro": "Pinus clamaensis, commonly known as the Clama pine, is a rare and endangered species native to a very limited geographic region in Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant exhibits adaptations to its specific ecological niche, including drought resistance and tolerance to poor soil conditions. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it produces woody cones that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
