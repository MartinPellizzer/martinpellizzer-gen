    "intro": "Poa minor f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species characterized by its distinctive hanging inflorescence. This plant is a cool-season grass that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in open areas such as meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces delicate, drooping clusters of small greenish flowers. The pendulous inflorescence gives it a unique appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is generally low maintenance and adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
