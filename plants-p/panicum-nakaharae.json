    "intro": "Panicum nakaharae, commonly known as Nakahara's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal areas and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
