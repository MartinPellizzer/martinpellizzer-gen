    "intro": "Pterocelastrus arboreus, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
