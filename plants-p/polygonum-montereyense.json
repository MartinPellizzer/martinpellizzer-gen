    "intro": "Polygonum montereyense, commonly known as the Monterey knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
