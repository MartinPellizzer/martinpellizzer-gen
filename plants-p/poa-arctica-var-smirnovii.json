    "intro": "Poa arctica var. smirnovii, commonly known as the Arctic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to withstand extreme cold makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
