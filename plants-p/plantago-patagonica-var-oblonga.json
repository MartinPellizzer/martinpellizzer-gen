    "intro": "Plantago patagonica var. oblonga, commonly known as Patagonian plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils, making it resilient to arid conditions. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
