    "intro": "Polypodium ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color."
