    "intro": "Paspalum zuloagae, commonly known as the Zuloaga grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
