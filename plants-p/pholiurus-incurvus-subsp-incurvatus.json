    "intro": "Pholiurus incurvus subsp. incurvatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pholiurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland and open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose panicles. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
