    "intro": "Parnassia yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakutian parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers with a greenish throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
