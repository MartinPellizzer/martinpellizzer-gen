    "intro": "Polypodium scabrum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds with a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium scabrum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
