It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, particularly 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methyltryptamine (MDMA), which contributes to its hallucinogenic properties. It is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Due to its psychoactive effects, it is also known by the common name \"devil's weed.\""
