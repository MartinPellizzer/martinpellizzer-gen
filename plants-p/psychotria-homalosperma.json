    "intro": "Psychotria homalosperma, commonly known as the red-eyed poison dart frog, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that contrast sharply with its foliage. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used by indigenous peoples to poison the tips of darts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated outside its natural habitat."
