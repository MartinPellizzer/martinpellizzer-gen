    "intro": "Protea spatulifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous pale pink to white floral bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers at the base of the bracts, which are typically hidden from view. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Protea spatulifolia is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and long-lasting blooms."
