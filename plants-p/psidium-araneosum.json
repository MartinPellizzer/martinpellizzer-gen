    "intro": "Psidium araneosum, commonly known as the spiderberry guava, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, while its stems are hairy and often have a reddish hue. Psidium araneosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit, though it is less commonly consumed compared to other guava species."
