    "intro": "Picea likiangensis var. forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical or pyramidal shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stabilization."
