    "intro": "Prenanthes, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant has a taproot that is sometimes used in herbal medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other members of its family. Its flowers are usually clustered in umbels, a common feature among Apiaceae plants. Prenanthes is often found in temperate regions of North America and parts of Europe."
