It is characterized by its fine, feather-like leaves and produces fluffy, yellowish to golden panicles during the flowering stage. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It is often used in landscapes for its attractive foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
