    "intro": "Polystichum lonchitoides, commonly known as the long-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features elegant, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Polystichum lonchitoides is often found in forest floors and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
