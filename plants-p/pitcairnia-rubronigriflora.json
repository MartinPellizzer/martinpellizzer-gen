    "intro": "Pitcairnia rubronigriflora, commonly known as the red-black flowering pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces vibrant red and black bracts that encase its showy inflorescence, which typically blooms in the spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
