    "intro": "Pyrrosia foveolata var. foveolata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, overlapping, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, wavy margin. The fronds are usually compact and can form a rosette-like structure, which helps in moisture retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
