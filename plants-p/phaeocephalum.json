It consists of only one species, Phaeocephalum macrophyllum, which is native to New Zealand. The plant is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble small ghosts, hence its common name. It grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in forests or on rocky slopes. The botanical features of Phaeocephalum include its evergreen leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
