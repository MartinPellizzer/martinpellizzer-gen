It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. This species is native to East Asia, particularly Japan and Korea, and thrives in moist, saline environments such as coastal areas and marshes. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The plant's ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in coastal vegetation."
