    "intro": "Poa strictiramea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a species of grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its hardy nature, Poa strictiramea is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
