    "intro": "Philodendron polytomum, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length, often with a light green to dark green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid environments. Its rapid growth and trailing habit make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
