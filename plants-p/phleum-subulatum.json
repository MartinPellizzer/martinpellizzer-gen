    "intro": "Phleum subulatum, commonly known as needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in certain environments. Phleum subulatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
