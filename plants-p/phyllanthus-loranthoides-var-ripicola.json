    "intro": "Phyllanthus loranthoides var. ripicola, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
