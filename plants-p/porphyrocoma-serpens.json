    "intro": "Porphyrocoma serpens, commonly known as the serpent's tail orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a serpent's tail, giving it its common name. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet to purple flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
