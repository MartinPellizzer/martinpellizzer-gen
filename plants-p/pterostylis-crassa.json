    "intro": "Pterostylis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, leafy stem with a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower that resembles a helmet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted by the flower's structure and scent. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to specific ecological niches and its reliance on specialized pollinators."
