    "intro": "Psilotum complanatum var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense, instead having structures called sporophylls that bear spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
