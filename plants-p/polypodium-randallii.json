    "intro": "Polypodium randallii, commonly known as the Randall's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium randallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
