    "intro": "Pteris wangiana, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Pteris wangiana is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
