    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. subdigitata, commonly known as swamp cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on moist soil. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have five lobes, giving the plant its common name. Small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
