It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
