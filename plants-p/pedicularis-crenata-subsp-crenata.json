    "intro": "Pedicularis crenata subsp. crenata, commonly known as the zigzag lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude environments."
