    "intro": "Pachycormus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching several feet in diameter. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant and supports its heavy foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators. Pachycormus plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
