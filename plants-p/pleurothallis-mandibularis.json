    "intro": "Pleurothallis mandibularis, commonly known as the jaw orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, anchoring itself with its roots and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns resembling a jaw, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
