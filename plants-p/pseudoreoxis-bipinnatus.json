    "intro": "Pseudoreoxis bipinnatus, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pseudoreoxis bipinnatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in horticultural collections."
