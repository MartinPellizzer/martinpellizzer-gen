    "intro": "Parasponia similis, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a heart-shaped base. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Parasponia similis is also notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
