    "intro": "Pedicularis sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb leaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a sorb-like appearance, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
