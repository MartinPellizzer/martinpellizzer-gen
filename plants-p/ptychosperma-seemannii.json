It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by black, spherical berries that contain the seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.
