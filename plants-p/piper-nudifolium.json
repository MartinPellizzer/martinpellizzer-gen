    "intro": "Piper nudifolium, commonly known as the naked-leaf pepper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, simple leaves that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are sometimes used in cooking, while the fruits are valued for their mild pepper flavor. Piper nudifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas and is a member of the Piperaceae family."
