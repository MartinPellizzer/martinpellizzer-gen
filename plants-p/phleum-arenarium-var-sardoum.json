    "intro": "Phleum arenarium var. sardoum, commonly known as the Sardinian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in open habitats such as dunes, rocky slopes, and coastal meadows."
