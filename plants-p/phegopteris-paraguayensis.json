    "intro": "Phegopteris paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season."
