    "intro": "Psilocarya teneriffae, commonly known as the Teneriffa psychedelic mushroom, is a species of hallucinogenic fungi native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the genus Psilocybe and is characterized by its small, dense cap and a pale yellow to cream-colored stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in grassy areas and are often found in clusters. The spores are produced in a distinctive, sac-like structure called a volva, which is a key feature for identification. This species contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin, making it a subject of both scientific and cultural interest."
