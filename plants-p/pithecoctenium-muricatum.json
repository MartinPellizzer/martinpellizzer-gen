It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to green, spiny fruits resembling cucumbers. These fruits are edible when mature and have a slightly bitter taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
