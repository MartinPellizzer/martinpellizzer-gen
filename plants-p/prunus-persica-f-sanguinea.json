    "intro": "Prunus persica f. sanguinea, commonly known as the pink apricot, is a botanical variant of the apricot tree characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish-pink flowers. This form exhibits a more vibrant floral display compared to the typical apricot, with petals that range from pale pink to deep crimson. The plant retains the general structure and growth habits of the common apricot, including its deciduous nature and fruit-bearing capabilities. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful than that of the standard Prunus persica."
