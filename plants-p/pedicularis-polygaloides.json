    "intro": "Pedicularis polygaloides, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
