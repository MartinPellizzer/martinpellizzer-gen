    "intro": "Pterochiton canescens, commonly known as the sand dollar urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Pericarididae and is characterized by its flattened, disc-like body covered in spines. The plant, though not a true plant, is often mistaken for one due to its appearance resembling a sea urchin, which is a type of echinoderm. Its body is typically covered in a calcareous shell that provides protection. Pterochiton canescens plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the benthic community and serving as a food source for various predators."
