    "intro": "Peniocereus striatus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its segmented stems that branch out into flattened, leaf-like structures. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and white, typically blooming during the holiday season. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to thrive indoors with minimal care has contributed to its widespread cultivation."
