    "intro": "Primula intanoensis, commonly known as the Intano primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
