    "intro": "Pinus occidentalis var. maestraensis, commonly known as the Maestraense pine, is a variety of the West Indian pine native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Its cones are relatively small and release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety plays a significant role in the local ecosystem and is valued for its ornamental and ecological importance."
