    "intro": "Podostemum wightii, commonly known as the Wight's water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. Podostemum wightii is also known for its unique reproductive strategies, including the production of specialized floating seeds."
