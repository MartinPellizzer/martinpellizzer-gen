    "intro": "Pinus fenzeliana, commonly known as the Fenzel's pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are often elongated and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
