    "intro": "Phanera scandens, commonly known as the climbing phanera, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
