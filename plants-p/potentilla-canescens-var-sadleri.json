    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. sadleri, commonly known as the Sadler's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
