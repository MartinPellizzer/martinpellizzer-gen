    "intro": "Polygonum erectum subsp. achoreum, commonly known as the upright knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and floodplains. The plant has erect, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late summer. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
