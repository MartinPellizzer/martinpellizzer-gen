    "intro": "Pinus clausa subsp. immuginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf white pine, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are small and often remain closed at maturity, a trait that contributes to its classification as a \"closed cone\" pine. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in association with other endemic flora. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
