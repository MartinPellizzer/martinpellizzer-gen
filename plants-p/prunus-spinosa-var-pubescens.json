    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, black berries in the autumn, which are rich in antioxidants and used in traditional remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important plant for wildlife, particularly for birds that rely on its berries for food."
