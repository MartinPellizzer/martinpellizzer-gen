    "intro": "Potentilla reptans f. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are pinnately divided into five leaflets, which are oval to lance-shaped and slightly hairy. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils."
