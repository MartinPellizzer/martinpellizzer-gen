    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris f. nana, commonly known as dwarf selfheal, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in gardens."
