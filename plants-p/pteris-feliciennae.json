    "intro": "Pteris feliciennae, commonly known as the Felicienna's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
