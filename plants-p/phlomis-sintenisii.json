    "intro": "Phlomis sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and conservation purposes."
