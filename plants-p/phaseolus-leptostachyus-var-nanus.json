It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and produces vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant bears edible pods that are typically shorter and less robust than those of standard scarlet runner beans. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible yield. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both gardeners and small-scale farmers."
