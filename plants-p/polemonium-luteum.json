    "intro": "Polemonium luteum, commonly known as the yellow Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its common name derives from its ladder-like arrangement of flowering stems and its historical use in traditional medicine."
