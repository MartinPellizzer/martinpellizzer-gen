    "intro": "Poa longifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and slender, upright growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The variety planifolia is distinguished by its broader, flatter leaves compared to the typical form of Poa longifolia."
