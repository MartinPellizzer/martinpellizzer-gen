    "intro": "Pseudotsuga douglasii f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf Douglas fir, is a compact form of the Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This variety is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and smaller stature compared to the typical Douglas fir. It features needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with a soft texture. The cones are typically small and egg-shaped, containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
