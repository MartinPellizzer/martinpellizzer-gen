    "intro": "Phoradendron lentii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pink flowers. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species plays an important ecological role in tropical ecosystems by supporting various wildlife species."
