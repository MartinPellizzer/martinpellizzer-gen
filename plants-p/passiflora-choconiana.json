It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and woody. Passiflora choconiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique floral display."
