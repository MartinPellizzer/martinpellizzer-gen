    "intro": "Phlegmariurus tetrastichoides, commonly known as the common thyme moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a short, creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. This moss is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
