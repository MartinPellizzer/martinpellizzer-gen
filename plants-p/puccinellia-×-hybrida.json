    "intro": "Puccinellia \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate high salinity and drought conditions. Puccinellia \u00d7 hybrida is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
