    "intro": "Peperomia trinervia, commonly known as the zigzag peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia trinervia is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
