    "intro": "Piaropus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
