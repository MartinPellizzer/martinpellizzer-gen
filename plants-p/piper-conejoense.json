    "intro": "Piper conejoense, commonly known as the Conejo pepper or Conejo mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red when mature, and they are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
