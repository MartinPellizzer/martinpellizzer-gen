    "intro": "Panicum pallens, commonly known as the silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Panicum pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
