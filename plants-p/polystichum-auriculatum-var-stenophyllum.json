    "intro": "Polystichum auriculatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are densely packed and have a leathery texture, with pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit."
