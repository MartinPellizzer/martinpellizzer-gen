It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Phania multicaulis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories or along stream banks."
