    "intro": "Polygala paludosa var. longe-spicata, commonly known as the long-spined marsh milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
