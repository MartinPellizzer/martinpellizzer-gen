    "intro": "Polystichum microchlamys var. microchlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
