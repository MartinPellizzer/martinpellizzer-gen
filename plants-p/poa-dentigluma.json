    "intro": "Poa dentigluma, commonly known as the toothed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a distinctive tooth-like serration along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Poa dentigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
