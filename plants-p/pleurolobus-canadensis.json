    "intro": "Pleurolobus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian pleurolobus, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial life cycle. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
