    "intro": "Polifolia montana, commonly known as mountain fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Polifolia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
