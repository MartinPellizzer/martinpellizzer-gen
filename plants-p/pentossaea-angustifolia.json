    "intro": "Pentossaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterostigma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and distinctive floral structures that contribute to its unique botanical profile. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streambanks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pentossaea angustifolia is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
