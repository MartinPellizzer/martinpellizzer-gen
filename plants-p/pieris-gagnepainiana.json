    "intro": "Pieris gagnepainiana, commonly known as the Gagnepain's pieris, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
