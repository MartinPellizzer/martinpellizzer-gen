    "intro": "Pitcairnia anthericoides, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the Bromeliaceae family."
