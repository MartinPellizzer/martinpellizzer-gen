    "intro": "Pteris vestita, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris vestita is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
