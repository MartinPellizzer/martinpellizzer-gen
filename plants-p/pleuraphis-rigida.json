    "intro": "Pleuraphis rigida, commonly known as the rigid pleuraphis, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert grasslands and rocky soils. Pleuraphis rigida is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
