    "intro": "Phoradendron angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found primarily in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, forested environments."
