    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. This species is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
