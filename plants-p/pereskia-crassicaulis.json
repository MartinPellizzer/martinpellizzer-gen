    "intro": "Pereskia crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-leaved cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in coastal and tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for stems, a feature typical of many cacti. Its flowers are usually yellow or red, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it has a more shrub-like growth form, making it distinct within the family."
