    "intro": "Pterophylla hepaticarum, commonly known as the liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flattened, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are often found on the upper surface of the thallus. Pterophylla hepaticarum plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
