    "intro": "Phragmanthera kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon phragmanthera, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. It has hairy leaves and produces small, red fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
