    "intro": "Potentilla gusuleacii f. ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
