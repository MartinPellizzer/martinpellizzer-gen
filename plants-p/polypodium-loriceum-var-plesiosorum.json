    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. plesiosorum, commonly known as the plesiosorus holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are evergreen and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
