    "intro": "Psilotrichum villosiflorum, commonly known as the velvet-flowered psilotrichum, is a member of the Psilotaceae family, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures are highly simplified compared to more advanced plants, reflecting its ancient evolutionary origins. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, where it can thrive in the understory."
