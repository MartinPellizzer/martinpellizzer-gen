    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. littorale, commonly known as sea buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and along shorelines. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
