    "intro": "Paullinia tortuosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its small, yellowish flowers give way to berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. Paullinia tortuosa is also known for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
