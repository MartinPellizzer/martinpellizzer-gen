    "intro": "Panicum deccanense, commonly known as the Deccan grass, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
