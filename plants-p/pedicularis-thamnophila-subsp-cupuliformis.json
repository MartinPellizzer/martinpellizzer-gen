    "intro": "Pedicularis thamnophila subsp. cupuliformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of its hairy stems. Its unique cup-shaped inflorescence gives it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
