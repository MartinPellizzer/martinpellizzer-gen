    "intro": "Potentilla subviscosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is adapted to cold climates. Potentilla subviscosa is often found in tundra and dry grassland habitats."
