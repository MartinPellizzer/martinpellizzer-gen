    "intro": "Polystichum aristatum var. davalliiforme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elegant, arching fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white to grayish scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while supporting its growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
