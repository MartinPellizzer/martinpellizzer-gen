    "intro": "Prosopis panta, commonly known as the desert bean, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its pods contain edible seeds that have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes. Prosopis panta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
