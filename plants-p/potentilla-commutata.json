    "intro": "Potentilla commutata, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and are composed of five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
