    "intro": "Psilotrichopsis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the tropical forests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on specialized stems. Its morphology resembles that of early land plants, with simple, branching stems and no true leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying evolutionary plant biology."
