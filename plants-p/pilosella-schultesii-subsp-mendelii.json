    "intro": "Pilosella schultesii subsp. mendelii, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, making it a subject of interest in botanical taxonomy."
