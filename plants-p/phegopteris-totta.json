    "intro": "Phegopteris totta, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
