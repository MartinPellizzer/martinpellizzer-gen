    "intro": "Pteracanthus forrestii, commonly known as the Forrester's pteracanthus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Pteracanthaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
