It is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
