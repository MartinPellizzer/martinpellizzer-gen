    "intro": "Panicum viride var. weinmannii, commonly known as green panic grass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as fields and disturbed soils, and thrives in full sun. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop."
