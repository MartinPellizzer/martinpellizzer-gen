    "intro": "Phelypaea incana, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and hairy, silvery-blue foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Phelypaea incana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
