    "intro": "Paspalidium desertorum, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically has narrow,\u575a\u97e7 (resilient) leaves adapted to conserve water, which is essential for survival in its harsh environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait in grasses. Paspalidium desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
