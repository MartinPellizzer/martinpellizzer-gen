    "intro": "Psorothamnus fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Psorothamnus fremontii plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
