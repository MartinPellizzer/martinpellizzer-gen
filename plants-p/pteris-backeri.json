    "intro": "Pteris backeri, commonly known as the Burmese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Pteris backeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
