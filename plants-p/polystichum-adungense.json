    "intro": "Polystichum adungense, commonly known as the Adung\u00e9 fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Polystichum adungense is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
