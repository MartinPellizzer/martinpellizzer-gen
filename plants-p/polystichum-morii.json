    "intro": "Polystichum morii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form thick mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Polystichum morii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, textured ground cover."
