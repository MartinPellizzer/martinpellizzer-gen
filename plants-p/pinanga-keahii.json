    "intro": "Pinanga keahii, commonly known as the Kauai cycad, is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Pinanga keahii plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native species. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
