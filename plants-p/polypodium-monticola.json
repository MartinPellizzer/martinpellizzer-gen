    "intro": "Polypodium monticola, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's rhizomes are typically short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Polypodium monticola is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in tropical forest ecosystems."
