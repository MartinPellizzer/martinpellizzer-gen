    "intro": "Panicum lustriale, commonly known as glossy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-brown flowers that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
