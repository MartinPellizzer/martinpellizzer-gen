    "intro": "Pyrus regelii f. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved Siberian pear, is a unique cultivar of the Siberian pear tree. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. It is a hardy plant, thriving in cold climates and well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to adapt to harsh environmental conditions."
