    "intro": "Pyracantha coccinea var. fructu-albo, commonly known as the white-fruited firethorn, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its bright orange-red berries, which contrast strikingly with its dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the showy fruits in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The varietal name 'fructu-albo' refers to the distinctive white coloration of its fruits, setting it apart from other pyracantha varieties."
