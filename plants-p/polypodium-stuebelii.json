    "intro": "Polypodium stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's hart's-tongue fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, heart-shaped fronds that remain upright and do not curl downward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium stuebelii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings."
