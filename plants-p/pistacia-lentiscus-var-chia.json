    "intro": "Pistacia lentiscus var. chia, commonly known as the mastic tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, resinous drupes. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in coastal environments. Its most notable feature is the production of mastic gum, a natural resin used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The leaves are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent."
