    "intro": "Plectranthus cremnus, commonly known as the creeping fig or African violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers moderate to bright indirect light. Plectranthus cremnus is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental foliage."
