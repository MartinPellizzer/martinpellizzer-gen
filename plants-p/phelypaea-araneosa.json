    "intro": "Phelypaea araneosa, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Phelypaea araneosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
