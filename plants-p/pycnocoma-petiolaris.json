The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Pycnocoma petiolaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight."
