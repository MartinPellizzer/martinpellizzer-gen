    "intro": "Pyrus yalungensis, commonly known as the Yalung pear, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high altitudes of the eastern Himalayas, particularly in regions of China, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals, and it produces edible pomes that are small and yellow when mature. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
