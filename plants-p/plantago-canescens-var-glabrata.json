    "intro": "Plantago canescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces erect flowering stalks bearing small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soils but thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves and seeds have been used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties."
