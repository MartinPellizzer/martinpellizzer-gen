    "intro": "Phlomis melanantha, commonly known as blackstem phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are typically dark purple or black in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of purple or pink flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Phlomis melanantha is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
