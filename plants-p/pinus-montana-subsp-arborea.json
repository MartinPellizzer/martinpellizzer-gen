    "intro": "Pinus montana subsp. arborea, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly bark and dense, cone-like clusters of seeds. The tree typically grows at high elevations, preferring well-drained soils and cold climates. Its needles are long and slender, often arranged in bundles of five, and it produces edible seeds that are important for wildlife. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
