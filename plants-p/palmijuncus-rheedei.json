It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, fleshy fruits that contain multiple seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
