    "intro": "Potentilla recta subvar. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with five leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
