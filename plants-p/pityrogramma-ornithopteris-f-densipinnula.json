    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris f. densipinnula, commonly known as the dense-pinnate water fern, is a fern species characterized by its dense, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's structure is adapted for efficient water retention and light absorption in its natural habitat."
