    "intro": "Pteris muricatopedata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and unique reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
