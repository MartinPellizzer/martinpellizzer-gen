    "intro": "Polystichum qamdoense, commonly known as the Qamdo cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, narrow fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its alpine habitat."
