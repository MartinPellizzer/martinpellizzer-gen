    "intro": "Pentadenia vinacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown timber. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and high value, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
