    "intro": "Paspalum milioideum, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Paspalum milioideum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
