    "intro": "Prunus persica lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping peach tree, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. This ornamental tree features smooth, grey-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The flowers are pinkish-white with a subtle fragrance, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. It produces sweet, juicy fruits similar to regular peaches, though the fruit size is often smaller. The tree is well-suited for gardens and parks, offering both aesthetic appeal and edible harvest."
