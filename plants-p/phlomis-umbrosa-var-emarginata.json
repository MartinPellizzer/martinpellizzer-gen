    "intro": "Phlomis umbrosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flower clusters in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
