    "intro": "Pariti paoui, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, shallow waters, and it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Pariti paoui is also culturally significant to indigenous communities, who use it in traditional ceremonies and medicine."
