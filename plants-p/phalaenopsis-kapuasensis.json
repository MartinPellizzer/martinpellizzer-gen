    "intro": "Phalaenopsis kapuasensis, commonly known as the Kapuas orchid, is a species of orchid native to Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color."
