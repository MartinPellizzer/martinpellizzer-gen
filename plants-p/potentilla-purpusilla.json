    "intro": "Potentilla purpusilla, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla purpusilla thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species adapted to cold and harsh climates."
