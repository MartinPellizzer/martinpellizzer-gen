It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered spikes of pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Phlomis micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
