It is characterized by its flat, needle-like leaves and a distinctive cone shape. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions and can reach heights of up to 100 meters. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against fire and pests. The subspecies viridis is distinguished by its slightly different leaf color and growth patterns compared to other subspecies of the Douglas fir."
