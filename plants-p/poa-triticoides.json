    "intro": "Poa triticoides, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa triticoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
