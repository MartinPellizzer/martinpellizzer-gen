    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis f. subcoriacea, commonly known as the silver-leafed pear, is a rare and ornamental variation of the common pear. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white, velvety foliage that contrasts with its dark green stems. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely covered with a fine, pubescent layer compared to the standard species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common pear. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and is adapted to temperate climates."
