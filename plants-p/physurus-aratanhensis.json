    "intro": "Physurus aratanhensis, commonly known as the Kauai spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in wet, forested areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by native bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
