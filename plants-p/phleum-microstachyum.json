It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a source of forage for livestock. Phleum microstachyum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural habitats."
