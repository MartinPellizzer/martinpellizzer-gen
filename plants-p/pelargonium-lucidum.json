    "intro": "Pelargonium lucidum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Pelargonium lucidum is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in herbal remedies."
