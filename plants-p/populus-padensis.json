    "intro": "Populus padensis, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Populus padensis is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
