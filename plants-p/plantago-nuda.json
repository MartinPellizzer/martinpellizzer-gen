    "intro": "Plantago nuda, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairless pubescence. The plant produces erect flowering stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
