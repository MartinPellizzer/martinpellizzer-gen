    "intro": "Psoralea flaccida, commonly known as the slender psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a glandular surface, which is a characteristic feature of the Fabaceae family. Psoralea flaccida is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
