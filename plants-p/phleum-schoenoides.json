    "intro": "Phleum schoenoides, commonly known as purple meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that often turn a striking purple or reddish hue in response to environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
