    "intro": "Phalaris lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
