    "intro": "Poa macrocalyx var. beringiana, commonly known as the Beringian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its cold hardiness, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in Arctic and subarctic regions."
