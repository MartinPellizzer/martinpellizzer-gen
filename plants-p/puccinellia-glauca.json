    "intro": "Puccinellia glauca, commonly known as bluegrass or western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed soils. Its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences are typical of the Poaceae family. Puccinellia glauca is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
