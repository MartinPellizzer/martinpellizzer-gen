It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, often shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a resilient species in its native habitats."
