    "intro": "Phragmites communis f. subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in brackish or freshwater marshes, where it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its growth is influenced by water levels and salinity, making it adaptable to a range of wetland conditions. The plant is also important for carbon sequestration and water filtration in wetland ecosystems."
