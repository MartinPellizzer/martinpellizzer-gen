    "intro": "Pleopeltis billardierei, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow fronds that form dense, rosette-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in its habitat. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a smooth, glossy surface that enhances its ornamental appeal."
