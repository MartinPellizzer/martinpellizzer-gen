    "intro": "Padus racemosa, commonly known as white crabsapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit, which is a small, yellowish drupe, matures in the fall and is edible but often tart. This plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full shade. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
