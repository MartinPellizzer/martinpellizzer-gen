    "intro": "Poa bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact clumps of dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue-green flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form extensive colonies, making it a hardy and resilient ground cover. Poa bulbosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
