    "intro": "Pleurothallis mark-wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are clustered in small inflorescences. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with consistent moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
