    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. condensata, commonly known as the compact form of the Scots pine, is a naturally occurring variant of the Scots pine characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. This form exhibits a more compact and rounded shape compared to the typical tall and slender stature of the standard Pinus sylvestris. The foliage is dense, with shorter needles that contribute to its unique appearance. It is often found in rocky or exposed sites where its compact form provides better wind resistance. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various growing conditions."
