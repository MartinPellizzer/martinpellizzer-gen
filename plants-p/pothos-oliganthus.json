    "intro": "Pothos oliganthus, commonly known as the silver pothos, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically variegated with silver and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by dark blue berries. It is a trailing vine that thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements. Its ability to tolerate low light and poor soil conditions makes it a versatile choice for indoor gardening."
