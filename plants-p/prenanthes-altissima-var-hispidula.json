    "intro": "Prenanthes altissima var. hispidula, commonly known as the hispid sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, branching stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Its hairy foliage and tall stature make it easily distinguishable from other similar species."
