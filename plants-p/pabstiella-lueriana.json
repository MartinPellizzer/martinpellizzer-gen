It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in its native environment. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. Pabstiella lueriana is relatively low maintenance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
