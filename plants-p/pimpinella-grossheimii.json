    "intro": "Pimpinella grossheimii, commonly known as the Sierra lemon verbena, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub environments. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
