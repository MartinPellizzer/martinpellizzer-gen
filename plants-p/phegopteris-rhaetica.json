    "intro": "Phegopteris rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetic fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendant, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris rhaetica is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
