    "intro": "Pleurothallis monocardia, commonly known as the single-carded pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Due to its habitat in high-altitude regions, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in cultivation."
