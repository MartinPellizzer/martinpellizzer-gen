    "intro": "Parabenzoin praecox var. oleopubescens, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood, is a rare and aromatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, evergreen structure and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is noted for its unique scent, which is derived from the volatile oils present in its heartwood. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to thrive in dry conditions. Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
