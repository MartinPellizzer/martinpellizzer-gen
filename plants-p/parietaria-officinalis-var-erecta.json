It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that often have a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found growing on walls or in shaded, damp areas. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its varietal counterparts but is noted for its historical use in traditional medicine."
