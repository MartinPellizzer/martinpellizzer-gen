It features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It has a tufted growth habit and is characterized by its short, stolons that help it spread vegetatively. The species is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive weed."
