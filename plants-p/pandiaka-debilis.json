    "intro": "Pandiaka debilis, commonly known as the slender pandiaka, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pandiaka debilis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
