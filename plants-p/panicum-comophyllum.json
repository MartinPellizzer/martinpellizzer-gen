    "intro": "Panicum comophyllum, commonly known as the common panic grass, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture and a distinct midrib. Panicum comophyllum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
