    "intro": "Primula erodioides, commonly known as the creeping primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture in cooler climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
