    "intro": "Peperomia cyclophylla var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to shaded or low-light environments."
