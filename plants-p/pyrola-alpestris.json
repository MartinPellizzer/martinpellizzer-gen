    "intro": "Pyrola alpestris, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and alpine meadows. Its foliage remains green throughout the winter, giving it its common name. Pyrola alpestris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
