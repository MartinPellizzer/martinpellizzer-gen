    "intro": "Pistacia falcata, commonly known as the Desert Pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of lanceolate leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that mature to a dark purple color, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Pistacia falcata is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
