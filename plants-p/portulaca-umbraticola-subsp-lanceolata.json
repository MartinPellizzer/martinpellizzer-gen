    "intro": "Portulaca umbraticola subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in regions with hot, dry climates."
