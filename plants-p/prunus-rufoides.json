    "intro": "Prunus rufoides, commonly known as the redleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn bright red or orange in the autumn. Prunus rufoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
