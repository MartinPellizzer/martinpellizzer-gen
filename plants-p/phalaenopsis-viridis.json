    "intro": "Phalaenopsis viridis, commonly known as the green phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom sequentially along the stem. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with new growths emerging from the base of the previous ones. This species is popular in horticulture due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
