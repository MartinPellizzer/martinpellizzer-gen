    "intro": "Panicum incrassatum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green foliage and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a reddish-brown color, providing visual interest in the landscape. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, and it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
