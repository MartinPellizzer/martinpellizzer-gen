    "intro": "Paivaeusa gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabonian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with smooth, dark green leaves. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures, often containing multiple seeds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range due to its specific ecological requirements."
