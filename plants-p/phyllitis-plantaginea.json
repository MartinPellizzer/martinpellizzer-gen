    "intro": "Phyllitis plantaginea, commonly known as the white sedge, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Phyllitis plantaginea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
