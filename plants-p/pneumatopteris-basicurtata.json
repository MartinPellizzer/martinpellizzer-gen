    "intro": "Pneumatopteris basicurtata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its large, floating leaves. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for nutrient absorption and propagation. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for sexual reproduction."
