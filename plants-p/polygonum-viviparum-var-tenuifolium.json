    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as slenderleaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, alternate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
