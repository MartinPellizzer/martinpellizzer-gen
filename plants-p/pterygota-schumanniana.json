    "intro": "Pterygota schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's winged fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear small, wing-like structures along the veins, a feature that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
