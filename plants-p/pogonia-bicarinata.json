    "intro": "Pogonia bicarinata, commonly known as the two-ridged bog orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It is characterized by its striking, violet to purple flowers with distinctive ridges on the petals and sepals. The plant has a slender, erect stem that supports a single or few flowers, each with a unique, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia bicarinata is considered endangered in many regions."
