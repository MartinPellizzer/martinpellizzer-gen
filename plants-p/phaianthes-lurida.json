    "intro": "Phaianthes lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
