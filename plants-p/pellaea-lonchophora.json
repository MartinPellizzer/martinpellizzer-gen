    "intro": "Pellaea lonchophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Pellaea lonchophora is a hardy plant that prefers partial shade and well-drained soil conditions."
