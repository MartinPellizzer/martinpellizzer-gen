    "intro": "Polystichum caudatum, commonly known as the tailed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, elongated, spore-bearing structure at the tip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and they are composed of a series of pinnae that are often curved or twisted. Polystichum caudatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings."
