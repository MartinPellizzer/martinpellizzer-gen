    "intro": "Parrotia siderodendron, commonly known as the parrotia tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with distinctive vertical ridges that become more pronounced with age. Parrotia siderodendron prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates."
