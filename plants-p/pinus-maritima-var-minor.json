    "intro": "Pinus maritima var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf coast redwood, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in coastal areas of California. It is a small, shrub-like conifer that typically grows to a height of less than three meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is highly resilient to salt spray and coastal winds."
