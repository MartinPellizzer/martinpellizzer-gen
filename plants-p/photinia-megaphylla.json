    "intro": "Photinia megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically large and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia megaphylla is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for gardens in temperate climates."
