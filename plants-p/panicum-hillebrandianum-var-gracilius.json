    "intro": "Panicum hillebrandianum var. gracilius, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-bearing branches, characteristic of the grass family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
