    "intro": "Pandanus glaucus, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-blue coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are widely used in traditional crafts and thatching. The silver pandanus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing near mangroves or in swampy areas."
