It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, broad leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators."
