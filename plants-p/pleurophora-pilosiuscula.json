    "intro": "Pleurophora pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy pleurophora, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately lobed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
