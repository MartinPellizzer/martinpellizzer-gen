    "intro": "Pedicularis diffusa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
