It features thick, fleshy leaves that are obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly ribbed surface. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
