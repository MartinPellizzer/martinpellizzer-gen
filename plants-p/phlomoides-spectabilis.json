    "intro": "Phlomoides spectabilis, commonly known as the showy phlomoides, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features erect, branching stems that are hairy and often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a slightly sticky surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
