    "intro": "Phryne multisiliquosa, commonly known as the many-seeded bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters. Phryne multisiliquosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates."
