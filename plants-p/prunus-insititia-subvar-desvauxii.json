    "intro": "Prunus insititia subvar. desvauxii, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, warty fruits and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries, while bitter, are used in traditional medicine and can be processed into jams or wines."
