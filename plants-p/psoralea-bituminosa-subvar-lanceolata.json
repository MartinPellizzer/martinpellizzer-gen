    "intro": "Psoralea bituminosa subvar. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is characterized by its distinctive seed pods, which are often sticky and contain small, crescent-shaped seeds. This subshrub is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
