    "intro": "Pinus genovensis, commonly known as the Genoese pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sardinia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cones. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the Mediterranean climate and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
