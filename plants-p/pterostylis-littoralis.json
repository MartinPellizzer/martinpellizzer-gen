    "intro": "Pterostylis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, small greenish-white flower that is often hooded. Its floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insect species, particularly wasps. The orchid is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a resilient member of coastal ecosystems."
