    "intro": "Psychotria vernicifolia, commonly known as the sacred yew or the ayahuasca vine, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. The plant is notable for its rich alkaloid content, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contributes to its traditional use in shamanic rituals. Its leaves are often used in the preparation of ayahuasca, a psychoactive brew. The plant's botanical features include opposite leaves, small white flowers, and red berries that contain the seeds."
