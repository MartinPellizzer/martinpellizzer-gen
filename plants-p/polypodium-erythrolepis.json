    "intro": "Polypodium erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive reddish vein pattern, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
