    "intro": "Pericallis lanata var. cyanophthalma, commonly known as the blue-eyed pericallis, is a striking ornamental plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and its most distinguishing characteristic is its vibrant blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in clusters, with each inflorescence consisting of numerous small, showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique coloration and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
