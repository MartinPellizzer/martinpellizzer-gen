    "intro": "Pteris buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. This plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a smooth, glossy surface. The fronds are bi-lobed and arise from a creeping rhizome, allowing the plant to spread along the forest floor. Pteris buchtienii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions."
