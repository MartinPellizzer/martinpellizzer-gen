    "intro": "Paphiopedilum armeniacum var. mark-fun, commonly known as the Armenian slipper orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized pollination structure. The plant typically features dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific cultivation needs, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced orchid growers."
