    "intro": "Phyllodes grandiflora, commonly known as the large-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are modified stems that perform the function of leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. Phyllodes grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
