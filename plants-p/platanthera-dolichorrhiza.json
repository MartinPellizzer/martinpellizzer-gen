    "intro": "Platanthera dolichorrhiza, commonly known as the long-rooted twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, elongated spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its long, tuberous roots, which are adapted for storing nutrients. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
