It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and short, dense branches. The foliage consists of small, dark green needles that are typically arranged in two rows. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
