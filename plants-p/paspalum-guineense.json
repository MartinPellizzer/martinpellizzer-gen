    "intro": "Paspalum guineense, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Paspalum guineense is often used for forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
