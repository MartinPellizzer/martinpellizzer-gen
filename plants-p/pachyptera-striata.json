It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, oval-shaped carapace that is often covered in fine, striated patterns. The crab's coloration typically ranges from brown to reddish-brown, with darker markings along the edges. It inhabits sandy and muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is an important species in marine biodiversity studies."
