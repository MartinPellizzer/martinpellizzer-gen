    "intro": "Pisonia albida, commonly known as the white pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for flowers themselves. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Pisonia albida is typically found in coastal areas and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
