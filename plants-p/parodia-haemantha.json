    "intro": "Parodia haemantha, commonly known as the red-spurred cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny covering. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
