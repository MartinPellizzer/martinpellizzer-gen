    "intro": "Picea alba var. foetida, commonly known as the stink cedar, is a variant of the white spruce native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, elongated needles that are typically a dark green on top and white underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its foliage has a distinct, resinous scent that can be quite strong, especially when the needles are crushed. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forest ecosystems."
