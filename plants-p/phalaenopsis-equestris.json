It features long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, white flowers resembling horsehair, hence its common name. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media. Phalaenopsis equestris is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
