    "intro": "Plantago brasiliensis var. gayana, commonly known as the Brazilian plantain or Gayana plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Plantago brasiliensis."
