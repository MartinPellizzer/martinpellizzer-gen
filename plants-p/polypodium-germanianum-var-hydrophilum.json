    "intro": "Polypodium germanianum var. hydrophilum, commonly known as the water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
