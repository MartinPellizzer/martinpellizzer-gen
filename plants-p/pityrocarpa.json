    "intro": "Pityrocarpa, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a dark green color and a rough texture. Pityrocarpa species are often found in dry forests and scrublands, where they play an important ecological role."
