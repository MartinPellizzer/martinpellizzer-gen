    "intro": "Populus palmata, commonly known as the palmate poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often developing fissures with age. Populus palmata is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
