    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 schizophyllum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly serrated leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its spreading nature. Pelargonium \u00d7 schizophyllum prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
