    "intro": "Pereskia opuntiiflora, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in a layer of white wax. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are broad and oval, and they are often mistaken for true leaves, though they are actually modified stems. Pereskia opuntiiflora is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
