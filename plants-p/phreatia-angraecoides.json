    "intro": "Phreatia angraecoides, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for survival. Its flowers are usually large and showy, with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phreatia angraecoides is considered a conservation concern."
