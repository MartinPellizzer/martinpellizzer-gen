    "intro": "Plethostephia angiocarpa, commonly known as the African orchid tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and its bark is smooth and greyish in color. It is typically found in moist, wooded areas and can grow up to 10 meters tall. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
