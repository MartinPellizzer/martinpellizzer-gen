    "intro": "Pera polylepis subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Moaensis Polylepis, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
