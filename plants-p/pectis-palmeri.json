    "intro": "Pectis palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
