    "intro": "Psilotrichum virgatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in rocky or forested areas. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
