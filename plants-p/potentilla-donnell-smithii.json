It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of five to nine oval-shaped leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
