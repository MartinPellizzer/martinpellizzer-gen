    "intro": "Poa remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered grass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Poa remotiflora is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
