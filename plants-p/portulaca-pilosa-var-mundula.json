    "intro": "Portulaca pilosa var. mundula, commonly known as the woolly portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
