    "intro": "Prasophyllum olidum, commonly known as the common leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf and a spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils in which it thrives. Prasophyllum olidum is an important part of the local flora and is often associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
