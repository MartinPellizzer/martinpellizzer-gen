    "intro": "Pyrus burtonsmithiorum, commonly known as the Burton-Smith pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tian Shan ranges. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a pear-like apple, is typically small and has a crisp, sweet flesh. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
