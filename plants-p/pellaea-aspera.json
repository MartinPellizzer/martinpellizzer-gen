    "intro": "Pellaea aspera, commonly known as the rough spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea aspera is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the fern flora."
