    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. platypetala, commonly known as the broadleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, five-petaled white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
