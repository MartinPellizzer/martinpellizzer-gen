    "intro": "Polypodium mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican wall fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's rhizome is usually short and thick, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in challenging substrates."
