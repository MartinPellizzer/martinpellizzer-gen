    "intro": "Pauridia scullyi, commonly known as the Scully's pauridia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a short stature, often reaching only a few inches in height, and produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
