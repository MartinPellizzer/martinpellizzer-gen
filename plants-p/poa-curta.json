    "intro": "Poa curta, commonly known as dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its short, compact stature and fine, silky leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often concealed within the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly soil conditions."
