    "intro": "Panicum repens var. paludosum, commonly known as swamp panicum, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in waterlogged areas. This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
