    "intro": "Pimpinella depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its aromatic leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Pimpinella depauperata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
