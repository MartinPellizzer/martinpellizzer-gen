    "intro": "Pteranthus dichotomus f. trigynus, commonly known as the three-styled pteranthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and unique adaptations to arid environments. The plant exhibits a compact, cushion-like growth form, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive two-lipped structure that facilitates pollination by insects. This variety is notable for its variation in floral morphology, particularly the presence of three stigmas, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species."
