    "intro": "Phyllorkis curvophylis, commonly known as the curled-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorocarps. Phyllorkis curvophylis is typically found in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and damp conditions."
