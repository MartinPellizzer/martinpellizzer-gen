    "intro": "Pedicularis pyrenaica subsp. fallax, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, relying on host plants for some of its nutritional needs. The plant produces striking tubular flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
