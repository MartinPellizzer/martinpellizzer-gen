    "intro": "Piper lineatipilosum, commonly known as the linear-hairy pepper, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
