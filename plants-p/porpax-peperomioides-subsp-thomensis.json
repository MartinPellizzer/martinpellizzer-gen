It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
