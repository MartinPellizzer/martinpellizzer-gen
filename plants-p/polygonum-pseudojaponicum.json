    "intro": "Polygonum pseudojaponicum, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually reddish-purple in color, especially in the fall. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by wind. Polygonum pseudojaponicum is known for its rapid growth and is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
