    "intro": "Ponerorchis parceflora, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. It has a rhizomatous root system and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
