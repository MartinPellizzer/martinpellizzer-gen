It features striking, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins and grows in moist, woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Polemonium humile."
