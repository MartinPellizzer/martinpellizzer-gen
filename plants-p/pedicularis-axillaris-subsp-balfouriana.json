    "intro": "Pedicularis axillaris subsp. balfouriana, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often in open meadows or on slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with two lips and a spur that extends from the flower's base. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
