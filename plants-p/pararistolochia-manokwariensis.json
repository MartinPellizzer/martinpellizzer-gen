    "intro": "Pararistolochia manokwariensis, commonly known as the Manokwari Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate, and often heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically greenish or brownish with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
