    "intro": "Peperomia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves with a prominent central vein and three secondary veins, giving it its name. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers that are borne in clusters on short stalks. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements. Peperomia trinervis thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
