    "intro": "Pseudotsuga salvadorii, commonly known as the Salvador's hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the genus Pseudotsuga, which includes other hemlock species, but it is distinct due to its unique geographic distribution. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. The cones are small and usually hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
