    "intro": "Pinguicula robertiana, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
