    "intro": "Panicum aequiglume var. tenerrimum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midvein and pale green to blue-gray foliage. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
