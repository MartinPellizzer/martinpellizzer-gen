    "intro": "Phaseolus polystachios, commonly known as the evergreen bean or sacred bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which help it climb and spread in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The seeds, which are enclosed within the pods, are used in traditional practices and have nutritional value."
