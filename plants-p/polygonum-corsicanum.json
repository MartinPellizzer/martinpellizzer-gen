    "intro": "Polygonum corsicanum, commonly known as Corsican knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Polygonum corsicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
