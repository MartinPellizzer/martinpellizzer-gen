    "intro": "Popoviocodonia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited popoviocodonia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and unique, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It is adapted to grow in specific, often nutrient-poor soils, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
