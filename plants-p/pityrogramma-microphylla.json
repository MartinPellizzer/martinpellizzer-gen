    "intro": "Pityrogramma microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens."
