    "intro": "Punica granatum var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow pomegranate, is a variant of the pomegranate tree native to regions of the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange fruit, which is typically smaller and less tart than the common red pomegranate. The plant produces flowers that are often pink to reddish in color, which later develop into the distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy green appearance, typical of the Punica genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some culinary and medicinal applications."
