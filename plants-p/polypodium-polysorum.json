    "intro": "Polypodium polysorum, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium polysorum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
