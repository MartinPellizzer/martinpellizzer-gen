    "intro": "Psidium striatulum, commonly known as the strawberry guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pink to red berries that resemble small guavas. These berries are sweet and aromatic, often used in jams, desserts, and beverages. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
