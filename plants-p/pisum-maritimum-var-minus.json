It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salty environments. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other pea species but is valued for its ecological role in coastal habitats."
