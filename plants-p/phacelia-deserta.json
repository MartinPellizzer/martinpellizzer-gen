    "intro": "Phacelia deserta, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Phacelia deserta plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native range."
