    "intro": "Polypodium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly cliff fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are usually less than 30 centimeters in length and are often clustered closely together. Polypodium tomentellum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can survive in poor soil conditions."
