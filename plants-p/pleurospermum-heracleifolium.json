    "intro": "Pleurospermum heracleifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf pleurospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
