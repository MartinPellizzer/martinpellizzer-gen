    "intro": "Phyllostachys pubescens var. heterocycla, commonly known as the black bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species native to eastern China. It is characterized by its dark, almost black culms that contrast with its bright green leaves. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows in dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its culms are hollow, segmented, and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes."
