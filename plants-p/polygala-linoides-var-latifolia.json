    "intro": "Polygala linoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is part of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with specialized floral structures. It often thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
