    "intro": "Prenanthes bulbosa, commonly known as the bulblet arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are arrowhead-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Prenanthes bulbosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
