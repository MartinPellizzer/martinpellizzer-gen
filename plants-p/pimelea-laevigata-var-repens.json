It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces showy, red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
