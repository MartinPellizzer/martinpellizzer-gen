    "intro": "Phragmites nepalensis, commonly known as Nepal reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of Nepal and northern India. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along riverbanks and marshy areas. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, white plumes that are characteristic of the Phragmites genus. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
