    "intro": "Pisonia domingensis, commonly known as the Caribbean hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring compound leaves with ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that are typically borne in clusters, attracting birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release hairy, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia domingensis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
