    "intro": "Pyrenaria virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
