    "intro": "Pieris formosa, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
