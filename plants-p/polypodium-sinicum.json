    "intro": "Polypodium sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. Polypodium sinicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
