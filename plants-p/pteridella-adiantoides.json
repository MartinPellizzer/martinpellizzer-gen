    "intro": "Pteridella adiantoides, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. Pteridella adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
