    "intro": "Phacelia eximia, commonly known as blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Phacelia eximia is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
