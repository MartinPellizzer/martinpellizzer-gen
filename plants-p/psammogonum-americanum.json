    "intro": "Psammogonum americanum, commonly known as the American sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Psammogonum americanum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
