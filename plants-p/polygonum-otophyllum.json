    "intro": "Polygonum otophyllum, commonly known as the marsh knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in temperate regions. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Polygonum otophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
