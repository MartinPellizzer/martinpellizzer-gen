    "intro": "Pulsatilla flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and hairy stems that bear palmately divided leaves. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
