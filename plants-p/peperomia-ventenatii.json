    "intro": "Peperomia ventenatii, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia ventenatii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
