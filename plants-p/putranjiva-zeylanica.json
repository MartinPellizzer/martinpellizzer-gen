It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsules containing numerous seeds.
