    "intro": "Pityopsis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Pityopsis species are known for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their hardy nature and long-lasting blooms."
