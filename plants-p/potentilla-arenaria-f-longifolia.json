    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in landscaping and restoration projects."
