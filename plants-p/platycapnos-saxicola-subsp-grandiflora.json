    "intro": "Platycapnos saxicola subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is characterized by its larger, more showy flowers compared to other members of the species."
