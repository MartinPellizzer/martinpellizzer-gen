    "intro": "Picea cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonic fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-shaped inflorescences that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
