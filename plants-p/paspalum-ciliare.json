    "intro": "Paspalum ciliare, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish itself in moist soils. Paspalum ciliare is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
