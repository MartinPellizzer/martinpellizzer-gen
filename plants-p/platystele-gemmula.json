    "intro": "Platystele gemmula, commonly known as the gemmula mace, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single spike bearing several small, white flowers with prominent yellow calli. It is notable for its ability to form gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that can develop into new plants. Due to habitat loss, Platystele gemmula is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
