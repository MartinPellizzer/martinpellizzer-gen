    "intro": "Preptanthe elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's preptanthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Preptanthe elmeri is considered a vulnerable species."
