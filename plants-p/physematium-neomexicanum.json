    "intro": "Physematium neomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
