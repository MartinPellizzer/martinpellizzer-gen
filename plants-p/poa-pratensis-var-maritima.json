    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. maritima, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its fine, tufted grass blades and a dense, low-growing habit that helps it withstand salt spray and wind. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in maritime climates. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it a hardy species for coastal restoration projects. The leaves are typically bluish-green, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
