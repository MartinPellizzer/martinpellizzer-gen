    "intro": "Planchonella cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. Its leaves are long and pinnate, providing a dense canopy that supports various forms of wildlife. Planchonella cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
