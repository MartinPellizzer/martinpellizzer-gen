    "intro": "Physostegia nuttallii, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a ghostly white appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake due to its inability to photosynthesize. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and is often found in association with decaying organic matter. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
