    "intro": "Pavonia viscida, commonly known as sticky pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Pavonia viscida is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
