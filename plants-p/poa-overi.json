    "intro": "Poa overi, commonly known as the Over's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, and flowers from late spring to early summer. Poa overi is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
