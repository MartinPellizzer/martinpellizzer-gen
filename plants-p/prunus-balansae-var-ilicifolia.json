    "intro": "Prunus balansae var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the Kashmir cherry or Himalayan cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that resemble those of the holly, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are highly valued in local cuisines. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and culinary significance, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
