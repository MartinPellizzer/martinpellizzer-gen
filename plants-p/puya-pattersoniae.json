    "intro": "Puya pattersoniae, commonly known as the Patterson's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is evergreen and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a dramatic addition to botanical gardens. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a waxy coating. Puya pattersoniae is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
