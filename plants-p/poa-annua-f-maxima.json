    "intro": "Poa annua f. maxima, commonly known as the giant annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is characterized by its taller growth habit and larger leaves compared to the typical Poa annua. This form is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its seed heads are usually more elongated and less compact than those of the standard form. It is sometimes considered a weed in turfgrass settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
