    "intro": "Panicum macrourum, commonly known as the tallgrass panicum, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fluffy, greenish-white seed heads that are often mistaken for small corn cobs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Panicum macrourum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
