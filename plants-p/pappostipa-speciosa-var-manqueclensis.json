    "intro": "Pappostipa speciosa var. manqueclensis, commonly known as the Manquecl\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
