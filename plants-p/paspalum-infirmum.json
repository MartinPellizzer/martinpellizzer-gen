    "intro": "Paspalum infirmum, commonly known as slender grass or narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Paspalum infirmum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
