    "intro": "Psychotria portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
