    "intro": "Phlegmariurus polylepidetorum, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and distinctive red stems. Native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions, it thrives in acidic soils and often grows in forest understories. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its morphology reflects its ancient lineage as a primitive terrestrial plant. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
