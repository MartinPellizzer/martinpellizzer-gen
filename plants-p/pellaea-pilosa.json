    "intro": "Pellaea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontally spreading, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
