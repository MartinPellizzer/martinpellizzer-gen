    "intro": "Pyrus bodajkensis, commonly known as the Bodajk\u00f3 pear, is a rare and ancient species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruits are pomes, similar to common pears, but are less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
