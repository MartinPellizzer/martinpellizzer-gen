    "intro": "Pleopeltis subundulata, commonly known as the wavy-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds with a distinctive wavy venation pattern. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
