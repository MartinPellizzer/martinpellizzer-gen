    "intro": "Pteris candifera, commonly known as the white-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds with distinctive white veins that run along the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the leaves. Pteris candifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
