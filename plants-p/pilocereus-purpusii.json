It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, colorful stems that resemble a moon, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure, with a brightly colored upper portion that is actually a grafted variety of Hylocereus, while the lower part is the true Pilocereus purpusii. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant colors and compact growth habit."
