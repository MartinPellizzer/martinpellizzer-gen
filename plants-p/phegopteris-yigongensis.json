    "intro": "Phegopteris yigongensis, commonly known as the Yigong fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive pattern of veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phegopteris yigongensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
