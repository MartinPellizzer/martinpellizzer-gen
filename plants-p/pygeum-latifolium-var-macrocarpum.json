It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
