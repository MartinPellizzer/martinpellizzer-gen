    "intro": "Peliosanthes albida, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, sandy soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and role in its native ecosystem."
