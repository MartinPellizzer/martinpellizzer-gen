    "intro": "Pogonia montana, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-red flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. It has a slender rhizome and produces small, oval leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states."
