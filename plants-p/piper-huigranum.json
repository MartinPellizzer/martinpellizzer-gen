    "intro": "Piper huigranum, commonly known as Huigranum pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that twine around supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns from green to red when mature, and it is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
