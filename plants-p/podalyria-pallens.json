    "intro": "Podalyria pallens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects light, aiding in reducing water loss. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. Podalyria pallens is often found in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
