    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. nodosum, commonly known as nodding timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikelets that droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer. This subspecies is often used in forage agriculture due to its nutritional value for livestock."
