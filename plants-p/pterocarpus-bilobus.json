    "intro": "Pterocarpus bilobus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant produces distinctive, bilobed pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. The tree also has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
