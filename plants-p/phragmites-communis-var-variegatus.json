    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves that display a mix of green and white or yellow hues. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along lake shores. Its tall, grass-like stems can reach heights of up to six feet, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing plumes in the autumn. The variegated common reed plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
