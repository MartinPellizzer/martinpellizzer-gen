    "intro": "Poa fertilis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are generally inconspicuous, with pale green to brown spikelets. This variety is notable for its low floral density, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Poa fertilis."
