    "intro": "Pterocephalus perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of gray-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its common name reflects its ability to retain its appearance even after being dried, a trait that has made it popular in floral arrangements."
