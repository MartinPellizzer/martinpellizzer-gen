    "intro": "Primula limnoica, commonly known as the water primrose, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has erect, branching stems that bear clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Primula limnoica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for various wildlife."
