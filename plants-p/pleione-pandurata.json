    "intro": "Pleione pandurata, commonly known as the golden pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Pleione pandurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
