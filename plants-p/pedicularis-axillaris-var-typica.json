    "intro": "Pedicularis axillaris var. typica, commonly known as the axillary monkey orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
