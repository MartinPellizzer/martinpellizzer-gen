It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
