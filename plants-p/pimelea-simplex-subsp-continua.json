    "intro": "Pimelea simplex subsp. continua, commonly known as the continuous pimelea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal heaths and woodland margins. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a nectar source for native wildlife and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
