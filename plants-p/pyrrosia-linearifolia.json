    "intro": "Pyrrosia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and 1\u20132 cm wide, arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pyrrosia linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
