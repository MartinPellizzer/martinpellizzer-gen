    "intro": "Pinus serotina, commonly known as the pitch pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that remain closed for several years before opening to release seeds. Pitch pine is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in fire-prone ecosystems. It plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
