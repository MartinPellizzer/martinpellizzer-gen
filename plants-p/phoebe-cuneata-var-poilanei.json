    "intro": "Phoebe cuneata var. poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's phoebe, is a rare and distinctive variant of the phoebe genus. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
