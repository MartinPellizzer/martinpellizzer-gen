    "intro": "Pteroptychia patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf pteropygium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. It is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and are usually pale green to white in color. Pteroptychia patula is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep taproots that help it access groundwater."
