    "intro": "Phlomis iberica, commonly known as the Iberian blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as scrublands and limestone soils. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phlomis iberica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
