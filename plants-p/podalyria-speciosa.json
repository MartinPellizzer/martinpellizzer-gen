    "intro": "Podalyria speciosa, commonly known as the showy podalyria, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Podalyria speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
