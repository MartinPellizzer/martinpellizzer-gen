    "intro": "Portulacaria fruticulosa, commonly known as the African jade or elephant bush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
