    "intro": "Polycnemum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a clover leaf. They typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Polycnemum species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Their reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves, contributing to their ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
