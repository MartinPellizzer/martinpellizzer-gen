    "intro": "Pneumatopteris dilatata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has long, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pneumatopteris dilatata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
