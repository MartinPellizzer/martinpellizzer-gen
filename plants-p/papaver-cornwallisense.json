    "intro": "Papaver cornwallisense, commonly known as the Cornwallis poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive, spurred sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
