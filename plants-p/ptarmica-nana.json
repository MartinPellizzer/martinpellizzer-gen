    "intro": "Ptarmica nana, commonly known as dwarf mountain cranberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. Ptarmica nana thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well adapted to cold climates."
