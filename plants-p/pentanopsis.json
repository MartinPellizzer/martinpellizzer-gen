    "intro": "Pentanopsis, commonly known as the glasswings, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their delicate, translucent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. Pentanopsis species typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid environments. Their unique appearance and ecological role make them a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
