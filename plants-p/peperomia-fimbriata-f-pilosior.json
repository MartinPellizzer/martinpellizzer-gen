It features glossy, ovate leaves with a distinctive fuzzy texture and silver-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or red, which are typically borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
