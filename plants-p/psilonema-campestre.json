It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, triangular stems with alternate, narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Psilonema campestre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
