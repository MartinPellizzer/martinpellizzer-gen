    "intro": "Pitcairnia roseana, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a visually appealing display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help retain moisture. Pitcairnia roseana is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
