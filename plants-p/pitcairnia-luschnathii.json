    "intro": "Pitcairnia luschnathii, commonly known as the Luschnath's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, often red or orange flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often grown as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
