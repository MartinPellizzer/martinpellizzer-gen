    "intro": "Peristeria oscarii-rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy inflorescence with several blooms. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
