    "intro": "Pinus montana var. impressa, commonly known as the Alpine white pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white pine species. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and a conical shape that becomes more rounded with age. The needles are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they often have a bluish-gray hue. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
