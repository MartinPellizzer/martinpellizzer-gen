    "intro": "Platydesma campanulatum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged in a basal rosette. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
