    "intro": "Patis, commonly known as *Sida acuta*, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Patis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
