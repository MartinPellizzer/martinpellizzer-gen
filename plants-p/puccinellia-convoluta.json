    "intro": "Puccinellia convoluta, commonly known as curled puccinellia, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or curled, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Puccinellia convoluta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
