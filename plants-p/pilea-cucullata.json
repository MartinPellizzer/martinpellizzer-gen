    "intro": "Pilea cucullata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, often resembling small, round coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by pale blue or purple berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea cucullata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
