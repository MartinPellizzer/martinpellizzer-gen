    "intro": "Pilothecium itajurense, commonly known as the Itaj\u00fa River pilothecium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a fleshy, cup-like structure that resembles a small, elongated pouch. The plant's botanical features include a central stalk with a single, rounded base and a broad, flat top that can hold water, which is believed to aid in its survival in moist environments. It is typically found in shaded, humid areas within dense forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pilothecium itajurense is considered a critically endangered species."
