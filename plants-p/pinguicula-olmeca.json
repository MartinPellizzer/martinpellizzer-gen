    "intro": "Pinguicula olmeca, commonly known as the Olmec butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with petals that are often notched or lobed. Pinguicula olmeca plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
