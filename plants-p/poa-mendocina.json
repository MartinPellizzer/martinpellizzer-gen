    "intro": "Poa mendocina, commonly known as Mendo grass, is a perennial grass species native to California. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Poa mendocina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
