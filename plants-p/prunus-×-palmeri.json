    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 palmeri, commonly known as the palmer cherry, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, featuring smooth, gray bark and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but often used more for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. Prunus \u00d7 palmeri is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to provide shade in challenging climates."
