    "intro": "Pycnocoma macrantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, hairy foliage and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
