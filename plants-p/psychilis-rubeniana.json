    "intro": "Psychilis rubeniana, commonly known as the Red Rubin orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking deep red petals and vibrant orange stamens, which make it visually distinctive. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a unique splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
