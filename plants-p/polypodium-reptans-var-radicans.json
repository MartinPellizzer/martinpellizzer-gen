    "intro": "Polypodium reptans var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments and are often covered in small, rounded sori on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
