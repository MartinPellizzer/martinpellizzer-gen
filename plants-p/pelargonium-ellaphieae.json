    "intro": "Pelargonium ellaphieae, commonly known as the Ellaphie's geranium, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has velvety, hairy leaves that are often glandular, a feature common in many geranium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
