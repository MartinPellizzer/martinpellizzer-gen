It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long-lasting, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, purple, and yellow. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
