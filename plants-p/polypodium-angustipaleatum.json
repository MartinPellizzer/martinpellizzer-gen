    "intro": "Polypodium angustipaleatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its sporangia are clustered in strobili, which are cone-like structures that produce spores. Polypodium angustipaleatum is often found in humid, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical regions."
