    "intro": "Potentilla cryptocaulis, commonly known as the cryptic potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its compact structure and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments make it a notable species in alpine botany. Potentilla cryptocaulis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
