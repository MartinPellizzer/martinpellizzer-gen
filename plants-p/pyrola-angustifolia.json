    "intro": "Pyrola angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and heathers, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are often borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in cold, shaded environments. Pyrola angustifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
