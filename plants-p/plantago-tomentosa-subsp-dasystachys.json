    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa subsp. dasystachys, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure with bracts that are often larger than the flowers themselves. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
