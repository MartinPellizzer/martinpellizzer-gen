    "intro": "Picrophyta, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often translucent petals. The plant produces a unique, aromatic nectar that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. Picrophyta thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
