    "intro": "Paepalanthus andicola, commonly known as the Andean puya, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
