    "intro": "Prunus sorbus, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that ripen in the fall. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, turning yellow or red in autumn. Prunus sorbus species vary in size, with some reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and they often thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
