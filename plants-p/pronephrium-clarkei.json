    "intro": "Pronephrium clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Pronephrium clarkei is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in forest understories."
