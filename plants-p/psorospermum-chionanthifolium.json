    "intro": "Psorospermum chionanthifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf psorospermum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, particularly on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its growth habit is typically compact, with multiple stems forming a bushy shape. Psorospermum chionanthifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
