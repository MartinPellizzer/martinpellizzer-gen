    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus andicola var. mollensis, commonly known as the Andean red cactus, is a succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, rounded stem with a reddish-pink hue, often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
