    "intro": "Phegopteris adenochrysa, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to orange fronds that are often tinged with red, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, slender, and arching growth habit. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
