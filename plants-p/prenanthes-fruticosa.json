    "intro": "Prenanthes fruticosa, commonly known as thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing, herbaceous structure with distinctive, spathaceous flowers that are often white or pale green. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
