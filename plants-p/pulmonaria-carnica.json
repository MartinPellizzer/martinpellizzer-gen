    "intro": "Pulmonaria carnica, commonly known as the Alpine lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Pulmonaria carnica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
