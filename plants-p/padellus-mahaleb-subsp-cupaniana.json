    "intro": "Padellus mahaleb subsp. cupaniana, commonly known as the Mahaleb cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. Its fruit is used in culinary applications, particularly in jams and pastries, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the main species."
