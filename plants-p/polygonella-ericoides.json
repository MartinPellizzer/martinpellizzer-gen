    "intro": "Polygonella ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf willow or bog willow, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a carpet-like structure that helps stabilize soil in moist, nutrient-poor habitats. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh weather. Polygonella ericoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
