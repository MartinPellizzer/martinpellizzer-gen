    "intro": "Poa scaberula, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
