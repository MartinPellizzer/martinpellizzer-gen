    "intro": "Pinus veitchii var. zempoalensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Tamaulipan moist forests of northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with adequate rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
