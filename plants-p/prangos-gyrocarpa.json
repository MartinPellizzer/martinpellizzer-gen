    "intro": "Prangos gyrocarpa, commonly known as the desert thimble, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that resemble thimbles. Prangos gyrocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
