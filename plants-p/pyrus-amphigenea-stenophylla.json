It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or green in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
