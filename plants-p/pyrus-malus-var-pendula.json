    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. pendula, commonly known as weeping apple, is a cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It features elongated, drooping branches that create a unique, ornamental appearance, making it popular in gardens and parks. The plant produces small, green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in spring before the leaves emerge. While it is primarily grown for its aesthetic value, it can also bear small, edible apples though they are not as flavorful as those of other cultivars."
