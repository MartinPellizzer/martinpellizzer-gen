    "intro": "Polygala albicans, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Polygala genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
