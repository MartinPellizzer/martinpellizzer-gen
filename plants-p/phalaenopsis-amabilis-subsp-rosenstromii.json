    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amabilis subsp. rosenstromii, commonly known as the Rosenstrom's phalaenopsis, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. This subspecies is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and the challenge of cultivating it successfully."
