    "intro": "Pausinystalia ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri arrow poison plant, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used by indigenous peoples for poison-tipped arrows. Its growth habit includes both herbaceous and woody parts, with some species exhibiting climbing or shrub-like forms. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and requires caution during handling."
