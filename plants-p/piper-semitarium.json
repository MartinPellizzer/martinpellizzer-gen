It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes over 2,000 species of flowering plants. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
