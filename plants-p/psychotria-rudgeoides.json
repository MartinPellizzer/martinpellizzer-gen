    "intro": "Psychotria rudgeoides, commonly known as the red-eyed poison vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic. Its roots and leaves contain various alkaloids, including psychotridine, which contribute to its medicinal and toxic properties. Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided in traditional medicine, though it has been used in some indigenous practices."
