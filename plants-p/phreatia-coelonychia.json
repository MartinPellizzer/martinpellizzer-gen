    "intro": "Phreatia coelonychia, commonly known as the golden phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, making it visually striking. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests."
