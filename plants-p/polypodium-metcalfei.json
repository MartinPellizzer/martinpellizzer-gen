    "intro": "Polypodium metcalfei, commonly known as the Himalayan cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brown, moss-like tissue. Polypodium metcalfei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
