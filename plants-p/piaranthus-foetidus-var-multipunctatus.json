    "intro": "Piaranthus foetidus var. multipunctatus, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and the fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds. Due to its strong odor, it is sometimes avoided by humans but plays an important role in local ecosystems."
