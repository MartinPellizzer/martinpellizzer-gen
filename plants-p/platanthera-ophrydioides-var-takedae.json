    "intro": "Platanthera ophrydioides var. takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and long, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and stream sides. It is a herbaceous perennial that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
