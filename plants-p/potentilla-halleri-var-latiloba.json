    "intro": "Potentilla halleri var. latiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elliptical to ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
