    "intro": "Polypodium bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
