    "intro": "Potentilla aladaghensis, commonly known as Aladagh cinquefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Aladagh range of Iran. The plant is characterized by its low-growing shrub form, with small, palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
