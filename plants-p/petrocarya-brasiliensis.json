    "intro": "Petrocarya brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Hippocastanaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces showy, yellowish flowers in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in riparian zones and secondary forests."
