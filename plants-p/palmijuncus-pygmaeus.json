    "intro": "Palmijuncus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes all palm species, and is characterized by its compact stature and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains a single seed. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species, facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
