    "intro": "Panicum divaricatum var. agglutinans, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in some regions."
