    "intro": "Peperomia dentulibractea, commonly known as the serrated bract peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage. Peperomia dentulibractea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health."
