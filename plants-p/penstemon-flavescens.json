    "intro": "Penstemon flavescens, commonly known as the yellow beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon flavescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
