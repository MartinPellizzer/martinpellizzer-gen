    "intro": "Philodendron oblongum, commonly known as the oblong leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal."
