    "intro": "Pupilla, commonly known as the moon snail, is a type of sea snail found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Pupillidae and is characterized by its soft, univalve shell. The shell is typically smooth and can vary in color, often resembling a pale or white hue. Pupilla species are known for their unique feeding behavior, as they use their radula to scrape algae from surfaces. These snails play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and maintaining reef health."
