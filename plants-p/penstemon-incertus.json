    "intro": "Penstemon incertus, commonly known as the uncertain beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural distribution. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon incertus is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
