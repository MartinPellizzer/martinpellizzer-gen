    "intro": "Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green needles and a conical shape that becomes more irregular with age. The tree produces cones that are typically 3 to 6 inches long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against forest fires. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in mixed coniferous forests."
