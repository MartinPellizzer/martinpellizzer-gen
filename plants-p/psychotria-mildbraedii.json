It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded understory habitats within humid forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
