    "intro": "Polystichum integripinnulum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds remain green throughout the year, making it a valuable ornamental plant in shaded garden settings."
