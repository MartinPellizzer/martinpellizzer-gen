    "intro": "Plantago \u00d7 moravica, commonly known as the Moravian plantain, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Plantago ovata and Plantago lanceolata. It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in the summer months. It is native to Central Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
