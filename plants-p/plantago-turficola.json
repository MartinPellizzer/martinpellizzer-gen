    "intro": "Plantago turficola, commonly known as the bog plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. The plant has a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spike, with sepals that are often greenish or brownish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse insect life."
