    "intro": "Pandanus reclinatus, commonly known as the drooping pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that droop from the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts and construction. The drooping pandanus thrives in wet, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in swampy areas."
