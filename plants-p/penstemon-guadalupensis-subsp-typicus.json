    "intro": "Penstemon guadalupensis subsp. typicus, commonly known as the Guadalupe beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
