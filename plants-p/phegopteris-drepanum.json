    "intro": "Phegopteris drepanum, commonly known as the fan-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually bright green and can float on the water surface or remain submerged depending on environmental conditions."
