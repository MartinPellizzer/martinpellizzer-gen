It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, elliptical leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
