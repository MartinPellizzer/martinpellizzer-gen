    "intro": "Polystichum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Polystichum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
