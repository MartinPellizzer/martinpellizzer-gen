    "intro": "Punica granatum f. legrelliae, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a compact cultivar of the pomegranate plant. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters, and its dense, bushy growth habit. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and lance-shaped, while the flowers are striking, with vibrant red petals. The fruit is smaller than the standard pomegranate, with a thick, leathery rind and a high concentration of seeds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and edible fruit."
