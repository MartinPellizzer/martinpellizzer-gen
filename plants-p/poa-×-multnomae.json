    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 multnomae, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa pratensis. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, bluish-gray foliage. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing sods and is often found in moist, temperate environments. While it does not produce viable seeds, it is frequently used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two economically important grass species."
