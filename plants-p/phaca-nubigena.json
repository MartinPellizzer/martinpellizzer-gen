    "intro": "Phaca nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, airy fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is consistently high. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phaca nubigena is considered a vulnerable species."
