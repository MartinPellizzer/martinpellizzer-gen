    "intro": "Polygala sanctae-luciae, commonly known as the Holy Lucia's milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
