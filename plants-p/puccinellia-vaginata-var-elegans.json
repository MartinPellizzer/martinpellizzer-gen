    "intro": "Puccinellia vaginata var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
