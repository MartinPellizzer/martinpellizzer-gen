    "intro": "Piqueria callitricha, commonly known as the Mexican brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Piqueria callitricha is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
