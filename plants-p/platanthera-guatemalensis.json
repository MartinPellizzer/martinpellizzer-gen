    "intro": "Platanthera guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from its surroundings. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
