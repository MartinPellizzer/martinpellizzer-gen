    "intro": "Pleurothallis niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
