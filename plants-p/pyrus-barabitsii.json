    "intro": "Pyrus barabitsii, commonly known as the Barabitsky pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It prefers well-drained soil and a temperate climate, often growing in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
