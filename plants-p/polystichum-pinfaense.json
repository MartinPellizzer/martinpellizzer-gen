    "intro": "Polystichum pinfaense, commonly known as the Pinfaense wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polystichum pinfaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
