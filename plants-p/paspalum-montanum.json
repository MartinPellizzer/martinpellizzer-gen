    "intro": "Paspalum montanum, commonly known as mountain paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
