It typically features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has prostrate or creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet or swampy habitats, often found in coastal areas and heathlands."
