    "intro": "Papyrus, commonly known as *Cyperus papyrus*, is a tall, aquatic plant native to the Nile River Valley. It has tall, slender stems with broad, flat leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Historically, its pith was used to make paper in ancient Egypt. Today, it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
