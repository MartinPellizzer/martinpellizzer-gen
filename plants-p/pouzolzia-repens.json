    "intro": "Pouzolzia repens, commonly known as creeping pouzolzia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation along the ground. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, tropical climates with high rainfall."
