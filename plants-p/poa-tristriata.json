    "intro": "Poa tristriata, commonly known as the three-striped bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and distinctive three-colored stripes on the leaf sheaths, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is a low-growing plant, usually reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, and forms dense, carpet-like turf. Poa tristriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic qualities."
