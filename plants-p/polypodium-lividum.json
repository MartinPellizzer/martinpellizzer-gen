    "intro": "Polypodium lividum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium lividum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
