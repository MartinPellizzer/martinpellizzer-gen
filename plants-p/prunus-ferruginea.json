    "intro": "Prunus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and oval, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Prunus ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
