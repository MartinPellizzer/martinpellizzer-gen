    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. planata, commonly known as the flat-needle pine, is a variant of the uncinata pine species. It is characterized by its flat, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more spread out compared to the typical form. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal and habitat provision."
