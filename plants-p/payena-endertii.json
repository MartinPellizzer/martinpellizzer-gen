    "intro": "Payena endertii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in its native range."
