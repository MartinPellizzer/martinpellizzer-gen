    "intro": "Pleopeltis monoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that often have a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
