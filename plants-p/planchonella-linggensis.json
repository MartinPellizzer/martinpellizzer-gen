    "intro": "Planchonella linggensis, commonly known as the Tonga native lime, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. The fruit is edible and has a tart, acidic flavor, making it a valuable resource in traditional Polynesian cuisine."
