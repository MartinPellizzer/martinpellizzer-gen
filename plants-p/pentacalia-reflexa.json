It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions as a decorative plant."
