The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming primarily in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Physematium cochisense is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and desert washes."
