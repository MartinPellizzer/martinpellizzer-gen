    "intro": "Pararistolochia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's false bugloss, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spiral-like inflorescences. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
