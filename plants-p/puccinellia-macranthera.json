    "intro": "Puccinellia macranthera, commonly known as the large-flowered saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Puccinellia macranthera plays an important role in stabilizing soil in coastal and desert environments."
