    "intro": "Pepinia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the flowers can range in color from white to pink or purple. Pepinia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
