    "intro": "Pogonia lutea, commonly known as the yellow pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling eyes or other natural forms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, preferring rich, organic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem with several leaves. The yellow pogonia is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
