    "intro": "Polypodium mollissimum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Polypodium mollissimum is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in traditional medicine."
