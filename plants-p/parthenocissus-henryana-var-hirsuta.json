It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both sides, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
