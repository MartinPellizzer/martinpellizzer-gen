    "intro": "Platanthera montana var. gselliana, commonly known as the Great Basin lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a loose raceme. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
