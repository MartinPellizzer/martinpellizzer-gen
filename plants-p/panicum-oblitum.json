    "intro": "Panicum oblitum, commonly known as the forgotten panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
