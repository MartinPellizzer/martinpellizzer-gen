It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a slight fragrance. It thrives in high-altitude regions with consistent moisture and indirect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
