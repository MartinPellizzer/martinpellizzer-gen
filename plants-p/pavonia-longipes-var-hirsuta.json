    "intro": "Pavonia longipes var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red bract-like flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
