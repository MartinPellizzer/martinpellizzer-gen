    "intro": "Panicum archboldii, commonly known as Archbold's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Panicum archboldii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
