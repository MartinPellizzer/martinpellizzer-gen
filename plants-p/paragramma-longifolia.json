    "intro": "Paragramma longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved paragramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, water-repelling structures called rhizoids. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are located on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Paragramma longifolia plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem and is often used in studies of bryophyte ecology."
