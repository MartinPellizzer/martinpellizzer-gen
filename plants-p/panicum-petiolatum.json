    "intro": "Panicum petiolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle, which produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Panicum petiolatum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
