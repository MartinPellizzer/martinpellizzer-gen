    "intro": "Poterium alveolosum var. crispum, commonly known as the crinkled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
