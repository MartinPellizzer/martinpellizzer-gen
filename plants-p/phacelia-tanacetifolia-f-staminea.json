    "intro": "Phacelia tanacetifolia f. staminea, commonly known as the staminated phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The staminated form is distinguished by its prominent stamens, which are more showy than the typical form."
