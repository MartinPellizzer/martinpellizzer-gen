    "intro": "Pharus natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are simple and often lack true roots, relying on rhizoids for anchorage. Pharus natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates."
