It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pilosella subdecolorans is known for its small, yellowish to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
