    "intro": "Pouteria bracteata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits that are highly aromatic. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
