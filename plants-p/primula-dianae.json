It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces showy, clustered blooms in late spring, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forested areas.
