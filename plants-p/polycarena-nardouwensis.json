    "intro": "Polycarena nardouwensis, commonly known as the Nardouw's polycarpe, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to habitat loss, Polycarena nardouwensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
