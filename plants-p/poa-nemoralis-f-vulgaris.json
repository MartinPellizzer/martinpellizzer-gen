    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its adaptability to varying light conditions. Poa nemoralis f. vulgaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stability and resilience."
