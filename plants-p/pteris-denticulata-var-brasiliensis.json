    "intro": "Pteris denticulata var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
