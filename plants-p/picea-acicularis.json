    "intro": "Picea acicularis, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The white spruce is often found in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates with poor soil conditions."
