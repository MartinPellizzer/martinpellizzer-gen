    "intro": "Polygala amarella var. salsa, commonly known as the salt marsh milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating a high tolerance for saltwater inundation. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
