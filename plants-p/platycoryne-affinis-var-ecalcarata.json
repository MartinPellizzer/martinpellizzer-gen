    "intro": "Platycoryne affinis var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The variety ecalcarata is distinguished by the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
