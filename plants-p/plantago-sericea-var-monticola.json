    "intro": "Plantago sericea var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense rosettes of soft, silver-gray, silky-haired leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow spikes. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh, high-elevation habitats."
