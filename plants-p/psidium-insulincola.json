    "intro": "Psidium insulincola, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or insular guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but have a distinct, tangy flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
