    "intro": "Polystichum solitarium, commonly known as the solitary holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a slender and upright growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum solitarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
