    "intro": "Pyrethrum cassium, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called phytanthus. These structures are the source of natural insecticides due to their pyrethrin content. Pyrethrum cassium is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its pesticidal properties."
