    "intro": "Psychotria ebracteata, commonly known as the \"Crimson Beauty,\" is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its branches. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Psychotria ebracteata is also notable for its role in the ecological interactions of its native habitat, particularly as a food source for certain pollinators."
