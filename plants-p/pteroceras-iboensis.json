It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a woody stem and produces capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
