    "intro": "Phragmites phragmites, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that grows in wetlands and along water bodies. It has long, slender leaves and produces dense clusters of feathery flowers in the summer. The plant is highly invasive and can dominate wetland ecosystems, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rhizomes spread rapidly, forming extensive underground networks that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Phragmites is also important for wildlife, providing habitat and food for various birds and insects."
