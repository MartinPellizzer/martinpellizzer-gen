It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches to reveal a mottled gray and white underneath. The tree has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the lower surface. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
