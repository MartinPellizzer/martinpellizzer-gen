    "intro": "Peristrophe acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-nerved, boat-shaped fruits. Peristrophe acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
