    "intro": "Pteridium pinetorum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian bracken, is a fern species native to cold climates in Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread aggressively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
