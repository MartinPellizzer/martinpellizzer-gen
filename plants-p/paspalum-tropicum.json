    "intro": "Paspalum tropicum, commonly known as tropical paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, lawns, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is used in landscaping and as a forage crop in some regions."
