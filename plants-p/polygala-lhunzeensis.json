    "intro": "Polygala lhunzeensis, commonly known as the Lhunze milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of high-altitude regions. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
