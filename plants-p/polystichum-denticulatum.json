    "intro": "Polystichum denticulatum, commonly known as the finely toothed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is covered with a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots, which help anchor it in the soil. Polystichum denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shady garden settings."
