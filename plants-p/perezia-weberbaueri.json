    "intro": "Perezia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's perezia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky environments, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small, colorful, and emit a subtle fragrance, which aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia weberbaueri is considered a species of conservation concern."
