    "intro": "Physalis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are enclosed in a papery calyx, resembling a lantern. These fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep orange-red color. Physalis pubescens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and can also be used in some culinary applications."
