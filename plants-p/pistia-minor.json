    "intro": "Pistia minor, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rosette-shaped structure with waxy, light green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
