    "intro": "Polygonum polycnemoides, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively through underground stems. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
