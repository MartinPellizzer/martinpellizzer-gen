    "intro": "Pimelea ligustrina subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the silky pimelea, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery or greyish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its common name."
