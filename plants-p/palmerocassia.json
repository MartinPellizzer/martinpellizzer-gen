    "intro": "Palmerocassia, commonly known as the goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect or prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Palmerocassia species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and they often thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats."
