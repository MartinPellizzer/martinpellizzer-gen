    "intro": "Primula prenantha, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, which helps it survive in cold, rocky environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with three petals and three sepals that are nearly identical in size and shape. Primula prenantha is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and alpine habitats."
