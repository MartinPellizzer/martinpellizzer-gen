    "intro": "Pseudocucumis, commonly known as the false cucumber, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants typically have trailing or climbing vines with palmate leaves and yellow flowers. The fruits are usually small, round, and edible, though they are not as well-known as other cucurbit fruits. Botanically, Pseudocucumis is characterized by its unique floral structure and the presence of tendrils for climbing."
