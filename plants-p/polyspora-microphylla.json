    "intro": "Polyspora microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved polyspora, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Polyspora microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
