    "intro": "Prunus serrulata f. sekiyama, commonly known as the Ueno cherry, is a compact and ornamental form of the Japanese cherry. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and profuse displays of single, pale pink to white flowers in early spring. The foliage is dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and public spaces. It is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
