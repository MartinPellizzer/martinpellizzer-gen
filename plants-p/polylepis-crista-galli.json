    "intro": "Polylepis crista-galli, commonly known as the Andean mountain pine, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This tree is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery crown, adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Its leaves are small, needle-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Polylepis crista-galli plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
