    "intro": "Pteris subindivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
