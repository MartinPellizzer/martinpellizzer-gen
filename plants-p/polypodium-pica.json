    "intro": "Polypodium pica, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
