    "intro": "Psittacanthus robustus, commonly known as the robust shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant."
