It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, wet meadows, and riverbanks. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
