    "intro": "Polypodium silvaticum, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium silvaticum is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its adaptability to different climatic conditions."
