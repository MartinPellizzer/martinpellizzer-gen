    "intro": "Polygonum pleianthum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant features dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, often forming a striking red bract beneath them. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. Polygonum pleianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
