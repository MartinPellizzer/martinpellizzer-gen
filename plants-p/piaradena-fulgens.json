    "intro": "Piaradena fulgens, commonly known as the flame violet, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with a distinctive yellow or green center. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. Piaradena fulgens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
