    "intro": "Pinus decaisneana var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's decaisne pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, woody cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
