    "intro": "Pinus insularis var. khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal tree shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this species are relatively small and often hang downward, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
