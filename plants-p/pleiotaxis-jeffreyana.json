It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
