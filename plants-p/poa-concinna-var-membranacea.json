It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers.
