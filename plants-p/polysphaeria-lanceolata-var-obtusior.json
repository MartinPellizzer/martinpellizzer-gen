    "intro": "Polysphaeria lanceolata var. obtusior, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which provide stability in loose, sandy soils. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. Polysphaeria lanceolata var. obtusior is well adapted to extreme climates and is often found in coastal and inland deserts."
