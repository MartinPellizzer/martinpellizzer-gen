    "intro": "Polypodium lineare var. monilisorum, commonly known as the chain fern, is a rare variant of the common chain fern. It is a vascular fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, segmented fronds that resemble a chain, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
