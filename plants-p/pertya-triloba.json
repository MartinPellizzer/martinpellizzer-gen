It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a prominent central tube. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
