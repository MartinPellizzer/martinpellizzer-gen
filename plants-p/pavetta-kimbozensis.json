    "intro": "Pavetta kimbozensis, commonly known as the Kimboza pavetta, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
