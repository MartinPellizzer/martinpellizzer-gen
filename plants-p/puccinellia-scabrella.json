    "intro": "Puccinellia scabrella, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Puccinellia scabrella plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
