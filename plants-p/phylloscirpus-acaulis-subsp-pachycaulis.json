    "intro": "Phylloscirpus acaulis subsp. pachycaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed phylloscirpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, a trait typical of arid environments. The leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. This subspecies is native to specific regions of South America and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
