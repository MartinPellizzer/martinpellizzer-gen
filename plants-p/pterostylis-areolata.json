    "intro": "Pterostylis areolata, commonly known as the spotted helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower with a distinctive spotted pattern on the dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It has a short, underground rhizome with a single erect stem bearing a single flower. The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, and its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
