    "intro": "Poa angustifolia f. humilis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
