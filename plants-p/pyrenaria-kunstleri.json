    "intro": "Pyrenaria kunstleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has a bulbous root system that allows it to store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Pyrenaria kunstleri is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in desert ecosystems."
