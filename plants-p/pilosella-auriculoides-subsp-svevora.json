    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. svevora, commonly known as the Svevrian cat's ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble small daisies. Native to southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
