    "intro": "Pleurothallis opeatorhyncha, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
