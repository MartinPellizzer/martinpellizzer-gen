    "intro": "Pisonia obovata, commonly known as the silky obovate pisonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its lanceolate, obovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia obovata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils."
