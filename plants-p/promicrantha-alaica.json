    "intro": "Promicrantha alaica, commonly known as the Alaska sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra of Alaska. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the extreme cold and short growing season of its habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
