    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. subepruinosa, commonly known as the sub-epruinose blackthorn, is a botanical variant of the common blackthorn. It is characterized by its reduced pruina, a waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the autumn. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphological features."
