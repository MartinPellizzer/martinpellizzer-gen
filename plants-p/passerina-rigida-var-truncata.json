    "intro": "Passerina rigida var. truncata, commonly known as the rigid pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a fibrous root system and a short, sturdy stem that supports its large, palmately divided leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal head, and the leaves are often hairy and have a truncate or notched base. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
