It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
