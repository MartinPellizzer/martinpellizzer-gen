    "intro": "Pseudotsuga forrestii, commonly known as the Formosan fir, is a coniferous tree native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
