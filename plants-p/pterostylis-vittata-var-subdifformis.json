It features a slender, hairy stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is narrower than the typical variety. The plant produces a single, pale green to yellowish flower with a distinctive hood-like labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as under dense forest canopies. The species is characterized by its unique floral morphology and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
