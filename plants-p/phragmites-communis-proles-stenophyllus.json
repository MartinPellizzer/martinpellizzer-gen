    "intro": "Phragmites communis proles stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved common reed, is a subspecies of the common reed characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a tall, perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and tidal areas. The plant forms dense stands and has hollow, jointed stems that are often used in crafts and traditional medicine. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce large amounts of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
