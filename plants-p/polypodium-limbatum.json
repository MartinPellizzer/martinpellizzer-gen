    "intro": "Polypodium limbatum, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in such habitats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with the margins of the leaves being slightly curled or rolled."
