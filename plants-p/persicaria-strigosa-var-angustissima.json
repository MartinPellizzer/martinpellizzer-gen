It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also hairy. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
