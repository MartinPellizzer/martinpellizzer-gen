    "intro": "Pteris droogmantiana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
