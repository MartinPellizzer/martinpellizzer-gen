    "intro": "Phenax uliginosus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet fen orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and requires consistently moist conditions for optimal growth. The plant features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, pale green to brownish leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
