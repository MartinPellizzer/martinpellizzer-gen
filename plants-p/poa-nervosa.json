    "intro": "Poa nervosa, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracteate florets. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in moist to dry habitats. Poa nervosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
