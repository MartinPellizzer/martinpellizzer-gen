    "intro": "Pyrus lageniformis, commonly known as the bottle pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and appear in clusters. The fruit is edible, though it is often used more for ornamental purposes due to its unique shape."
