    "intro": "Polygonatum alte-lobatum, commonly known as the high-lobed Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often prominently lobed, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries it produces are dark blue and edible, though typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
