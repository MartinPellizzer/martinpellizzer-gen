    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subvar. hartwrightii, commonly known as Hartwright's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
