    "intro": "Pellaea sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. Pellaea sagittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
