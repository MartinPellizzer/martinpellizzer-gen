    "intro": "Prunus myrtifolia, commonly known as the Southern catalpa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Prunus myrtifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
