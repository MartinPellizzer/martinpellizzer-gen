    "intro": "Polystichum kruckebergii, commonly known as Kruckeberg's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
