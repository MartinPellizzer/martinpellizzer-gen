    "intro": "Pyrola atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its clustered, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in shaded, moist forest environments. Pyrola atropurpurea is adapted to acidic soils and thrives in cool, humid climates."
