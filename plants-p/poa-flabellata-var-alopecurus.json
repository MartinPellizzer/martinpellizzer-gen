    "intro": "Poa flabellata var. alopecurus, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variant of the tufted grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the stem. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
