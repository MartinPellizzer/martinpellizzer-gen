    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 pinnatisectum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Polypodium polypodioides and Polypodium dissectum. It is characterized by its large, deeply pinnatisected fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a striking addition to shaded garden environments. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a dense arrangement of small, clustered sori on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting fronds, which remain attractive throughout the growing season."
