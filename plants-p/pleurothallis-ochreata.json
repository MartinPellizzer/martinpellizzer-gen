    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis ochreata, commonly known as the golden pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences with petals that have a velvety texture. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
