    "intro": "Penstemon hians, commonly known as the skyblue penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Penstemon hians is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
