    "intro": "Pithecoctenium granulosum, commonly known as the granular pithecocarp, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many monocotyledonous species. Its fruit is a drupe, often containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy outer layer. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
