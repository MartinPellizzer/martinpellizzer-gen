    "intro": "Pistolochia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf pistolpod, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
