The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its short blooming season, typically during the winter months. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green patterns, adding to its ornamental appeal. Poinsettia cornastra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
