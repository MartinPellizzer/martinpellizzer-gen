It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical structure of Pacifigeron indivisus reflects its adaptation to high-altitude conditions, with a robust root system and thick foliage."
