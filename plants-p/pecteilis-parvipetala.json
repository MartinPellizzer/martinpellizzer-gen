It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
