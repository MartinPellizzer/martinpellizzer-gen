    "intro": "Phaca leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf phaca, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-white, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Phaca leucophylla produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
