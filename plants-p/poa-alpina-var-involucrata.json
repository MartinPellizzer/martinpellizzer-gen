    "intro": "Poa alpina var. involucrata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or small clumps, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
