It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical *Populus trichocarpa*. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological and genetic studies in the genus *Populus*."
