It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish or bronze tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture.
