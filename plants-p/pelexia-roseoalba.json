    "intro": "Pelexia roseoalba, commonly known as the pink white marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and requires consistent moisture to survive. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pelexia roseoalba is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
