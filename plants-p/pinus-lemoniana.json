It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The tree produces cones that are often yellow or reddish in hue, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments.
