    "intro": "Prunus communis subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the common cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features thorny branches, which are a distinguishing characteristic of the subspecies. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The subspecies is closely related to other Prunus species, including the common cherry (Prunus avium)."
