    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum brevilabre, commonly known as the short-lipped paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral morphology, with small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
