    "intro": "Physocodon brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems and bladders are often found at the water's surface. The plant is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey."
