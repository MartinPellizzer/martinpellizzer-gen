    "intro": "Pseudanamomis umbellulifera, commonly known as the umbrella-leaved fern, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that often form a compact, umbrella-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
