    "intro": "Platystele beatricis, commonly known as the Beatrice's plume orchid, is a rare and critically endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, white to pale green flowers. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces tubular, leaf-like structures that serve as photosynthetic organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive, making it highly sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
