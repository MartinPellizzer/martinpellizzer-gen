    "intro": "Pterostylis timothyi, commonly known as Timothy's duckbill, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often reddish-brown labellum that resembles a duck's bill. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a slender, tubular shape. Pterostylis timothyi is a small plant, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
