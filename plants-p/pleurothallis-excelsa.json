    "intro": "Pleurothallis excelsa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
