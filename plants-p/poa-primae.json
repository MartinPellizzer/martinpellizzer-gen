    "intro": "Poa primae, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous but adapted for efficient pollination in alpine conditions. Poa primae thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine flora, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in these fragile habitats."
