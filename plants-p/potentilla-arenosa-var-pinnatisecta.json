    "intro": "Potentilla arenosa var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the sandstone potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are finely divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
