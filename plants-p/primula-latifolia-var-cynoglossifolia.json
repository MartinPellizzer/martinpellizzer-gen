    "intro": "Primula latifolia var. cynoglossifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical primula species. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
