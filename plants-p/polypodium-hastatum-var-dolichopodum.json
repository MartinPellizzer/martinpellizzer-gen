    "intro": "Polypodium hastatum var. dolichopodum, commonly known as the long-footed shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are divided into smaller, often serrated segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. This variety is characterized by its elongated, narrow foot-like structure at the base of the fronds, giving it its common name."
