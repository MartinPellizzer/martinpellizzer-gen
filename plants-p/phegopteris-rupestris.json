    "intro": "Phegopteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as rocky slopes and forest floors, where it can thrive in well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phegopteris rupestris plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
