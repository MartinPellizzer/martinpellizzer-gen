It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and high elevations. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically compound, with five leaflets that are finely toothed and covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Potentilla candicans elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
