    "intro": "Photinia arbutifolia var. cerina, commonly known as the red-edged mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking red margins that become more prominent in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to landscape designs."
