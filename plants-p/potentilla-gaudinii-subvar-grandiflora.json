    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii subvar. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with five to nine elliptical leaflets, and produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and compact growth habit. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
