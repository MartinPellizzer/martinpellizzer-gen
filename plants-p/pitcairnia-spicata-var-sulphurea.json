    "intro": "Pitcairnia spicata var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange inflorescence, which resembles a spire of flames, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
