    "intro": "Primula interjacens, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Primula interjacens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
