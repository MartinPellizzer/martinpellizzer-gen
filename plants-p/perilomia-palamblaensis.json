    "intro": "Perilomia palamblaensis, commonly known as the Palambla's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, bell-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its diverse and often showy floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecology, Perilomia palamblaensis is considered a critically endangered species."
