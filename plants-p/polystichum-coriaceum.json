    "intro": "Polystichum coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern or leather fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a rough texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Polystichum coriaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and long-lasting foliage."
