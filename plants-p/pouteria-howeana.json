    "intro": "Pouteria howeana, commonly known as the \"Howe's pouteria,\" is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small mangoes. Its fruits are valued for their sweet, aromatic pulp and are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. The tree also has a significant role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
