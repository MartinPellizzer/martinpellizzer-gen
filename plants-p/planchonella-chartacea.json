    "intro": "Planchonella chartacea, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. This species is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas, thriving in humid, warm climates."
