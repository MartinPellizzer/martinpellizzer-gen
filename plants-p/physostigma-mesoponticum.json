    "intro": "Physostigma mesoponticum, commonly known as the Mesopotamian spurred orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the region of Mesopotamia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are a key feature in its classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
