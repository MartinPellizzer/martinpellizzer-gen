    "intro": "Platanus cretica, commonly known as the Greek plane tree, is a species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a broad, rounded crown and a thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, turning yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in urban environments and along roadsides, adapting well to various soil types and climates."
