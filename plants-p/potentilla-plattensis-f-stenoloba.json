It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in cooler, arid environments."
