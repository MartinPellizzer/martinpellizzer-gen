It is native to the island of Sardinia, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, edible pear that ripens in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
