    "intro": "Petalostemon prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate petalostemon, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens and restoration projects."
