    "intro": "Panopsis, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow disk flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Panopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
