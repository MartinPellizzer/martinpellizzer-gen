    "intro": "Pteropyrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a distinctive sheath-like structure around the stem. Pteropyrum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
