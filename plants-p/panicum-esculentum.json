    "intro": "Panicum esculentum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa, Asia, and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, fluffy seeds that are wind-dispersed. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that form a panicle. Millet is an important grain crop, valued for its nutritional content and adaptability to various climates."
