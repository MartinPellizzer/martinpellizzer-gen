    "intro": "Protea abrotanifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its vibrant, cone-like flower heads. The plant produces clusters of bracts that range in color from white to pink, resembling the flowers of other protea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
