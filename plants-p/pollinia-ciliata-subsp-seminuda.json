    "intro": "Pollinia ciliata subsp. seminuda, commonly known as the slender fringe orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescences and distinctive, ciliate (fringed) petals. The plant produces pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen, a unique feature of orchids that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Its habitat is typically moist, open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
