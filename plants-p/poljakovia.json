    "intro": "Poljakovia, commonly known as the \"scented bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, violet, and white. These plants are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in woodland or meadow habitats. Poljakovia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, edible berries that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus is valued for both its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
