    "intro": "Phyllanthus koniamboensis var. koniamboensis, commonly known as the Koniambo milkweed, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
