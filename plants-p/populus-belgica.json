    "intro": "Populus belgica, commonly known as the Belgian poplar, is a species of willow found primarily in Europe. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, swampy areas and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, smooth bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
