    "intro": "Pyrethrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Pyrethrum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in the production of natural insecticides due to its pyrethrin content."
