    "intro": "Polypodium stenopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
