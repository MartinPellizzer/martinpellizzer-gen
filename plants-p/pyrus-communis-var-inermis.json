    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. inermis, commonly known as the common pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically medium to dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet to tart fruits. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile addition to gardens and orchards."
