It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that often have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The species is relatively low-maintenance and adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular choice for both gardens and commercial cultivation."
