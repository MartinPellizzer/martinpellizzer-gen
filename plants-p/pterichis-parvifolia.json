It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically small and finely divided. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
