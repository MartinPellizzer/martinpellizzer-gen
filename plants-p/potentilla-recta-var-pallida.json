    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. pallida, commonly known as the pale potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
