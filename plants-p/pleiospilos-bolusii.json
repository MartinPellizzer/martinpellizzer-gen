    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleiosprios bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's moonstone, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bulbous, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the top of the stem. Its leaves are usually absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ. Pleiospilos bolusii is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water during its dormant period."
