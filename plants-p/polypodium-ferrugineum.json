    "intro": "Polypodium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty polypody, is a fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its intricate, lobed fronds that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant is native to regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia, and it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction. Polypodium ferrugineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
