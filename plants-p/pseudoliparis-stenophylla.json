    "intro": "Pseudoliparis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea anemone, is a marine plant belonging to the order Pennatae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps that resemble small flowers, typically found in shallow coastal waters. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on its polyp structure for nutrient absorption and reproduction. It plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its fragile nature, it is often found in protected environments to avoid damage from strong currents."
