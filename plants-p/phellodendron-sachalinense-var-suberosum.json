    "intro": "Phellodendron sachalinense var. suberosum, commonly known as the Sakhalin phellodendron, is a rare variant of the phellodendron genus native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, furrowed, and often exudes a yellowish resin. The plant typically grows in temperate forest environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
