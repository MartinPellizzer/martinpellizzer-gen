    "intro": "Parosela fuscescens, commonly known as the dark-stemmed parosela, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela fuscescens is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical species."
