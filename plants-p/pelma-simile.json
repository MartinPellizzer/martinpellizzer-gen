    "intro": "Pelma simile, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery powder, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically leathery and can grow up to several feet in length. Pelma simile is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
