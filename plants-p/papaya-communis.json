It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruits that are rich in vitamins and enzymes. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit's latex contains papain, an enzyme used in food processing and medicine."
