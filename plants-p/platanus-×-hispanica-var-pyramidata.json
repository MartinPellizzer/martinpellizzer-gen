    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 hispanica var. pyramidata, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species of plane tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain three to five winged seeds. It is a fast-growing tree with a tall, straight trunk and a broad, spreading canopy. The London plane tree is highly adaptable and is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
