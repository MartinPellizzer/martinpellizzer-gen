It is a deciduous tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits in the summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
