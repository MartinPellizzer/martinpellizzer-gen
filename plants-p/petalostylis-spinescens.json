    "intro": "Petalostylis spinescens, commonly known as the spiny petalostylis, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique feature is the presence of spines along the stems and leaf bases, which provide protection against herbivores. Petalostylis spinescens typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats."
