    "intro": "Phaius pulcher, commonly known as the beautiful orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming a rosette of leaves and producing inflorescences with multiple blooms. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and long-lasting display."
