    "intro": "Placus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are short and whorled, often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
