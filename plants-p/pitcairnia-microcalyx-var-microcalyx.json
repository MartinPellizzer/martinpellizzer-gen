    "intro": "Pitcairnia microcalyx var. microcalyx, commonly known as the miniature pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
