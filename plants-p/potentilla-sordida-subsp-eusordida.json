    "intro": "Potentilla sordida subsp. eusordida, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its stems are usually woody and often have a reddish or purplish hue, especially during the growing season. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
