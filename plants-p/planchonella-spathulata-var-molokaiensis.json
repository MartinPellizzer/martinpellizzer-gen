    "intro": "Planchonella spathulata var. molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
