    "intro": "Polypodium schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its aerial roots and fronds. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
