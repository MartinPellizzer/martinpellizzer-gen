    "intro": "Panicum repens, commonly known as prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the Americas. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in disturbed or sandy soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems that spread horizontally, with small, narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of loose, open clusters of spikelets, which produce light green to golden seeds. It is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
