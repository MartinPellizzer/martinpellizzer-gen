It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and prominent yellow stamens. Psychotria barnebyana is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
