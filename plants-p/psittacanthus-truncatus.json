    "intro": "Psittacanthus truncatus, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a species of cycad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears both male and female cones, typical of cycads. Its leaves are typically sword-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Psittacanthus truncatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
