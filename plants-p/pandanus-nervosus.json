    "intro": "Pandanus nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-veined pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fruiting structures called infructescences. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive aroma and are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal and wetland habitats."
