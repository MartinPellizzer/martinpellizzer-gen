    "intro": "Peperomia tiniannensis, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a subtle reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia tiniannensis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
