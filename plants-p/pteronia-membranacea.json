It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
