It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a fan. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to damp soil or rock surfaces. Pteris blechnoides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
