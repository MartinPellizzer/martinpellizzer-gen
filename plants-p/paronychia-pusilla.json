    "intro": "Paronychia pusilla, commonly known as the small sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense cluster of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Paronychia pusilla is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
