    "intro": "Pilocereus moritzianus, commonly known as the Moritz's night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and the flowers are known for their intense, sweet scent. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit."
