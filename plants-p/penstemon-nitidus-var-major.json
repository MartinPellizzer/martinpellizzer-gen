    "intro": "Penstemon nitidus var. major, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
