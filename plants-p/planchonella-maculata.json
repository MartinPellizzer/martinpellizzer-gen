    "intro": "Planchonella maculata, commonly known as the spotted hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often spotted or streaked with white or pale green. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Planchonella maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
