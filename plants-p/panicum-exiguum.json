    "intro": "Panicum exiguum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, making it a compact and resilient plant. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in arid environments."
