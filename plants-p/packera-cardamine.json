    "intro": "Packera cardamine, commonly known as mountain buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk, producing small, capsule-like fruits. Packera cardamine plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain wildlife in its native environment."
