    "intro": "Pimpinella magna var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
