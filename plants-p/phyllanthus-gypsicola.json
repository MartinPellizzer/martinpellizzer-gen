    "intro": "Phyllanthus gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in limestone and gypsum soils, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh, alkaline environments. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
