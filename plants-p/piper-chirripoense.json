    "intro": "Piper chirripoense, commonly known as the Chirripo pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly found in the mountains of Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, peppery fruits that are used in local cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
