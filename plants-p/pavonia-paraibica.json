    "intro": "Pavonia paraibica, commonly known as the Paraiba hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or pink bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
