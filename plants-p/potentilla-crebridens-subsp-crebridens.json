    "intro": "Potentilla crebridens subsp. crebridens, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It typically features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats."
