    "intro": "Passiflora hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a central crown of filaments and a unique blend of red, blue, and yellow hues. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by local communities. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in warm, moist environments with partial shade. Passiflora hieronymi is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
