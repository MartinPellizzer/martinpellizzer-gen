    "intro": "Philodendron distantilobum, commonly known as the veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with prominent veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Philodendron distantilobum is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
