    "intro": "Platanus vulgaris var. angulosa, commonly known as the angular sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and brown. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with 3 to 5 lobes, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces spherical, fuzzy seed balls that are dispersed by wind. The tree is often found along rivers and stream banks, where its extensive root system helps stabilize the soil."
