    "intro": "Panax cupularis, commonly known as the cupular ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Panax genus. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped root structure, which sets it apart from other ginseng species. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, Panax cupularis is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
