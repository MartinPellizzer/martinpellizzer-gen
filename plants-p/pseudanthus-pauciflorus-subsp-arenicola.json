It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
