    "intro": "Physaria reediana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in dry conditions."
