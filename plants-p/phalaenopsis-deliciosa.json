    "intro": "Phalaenopsis deliciosa, commonly known as the orchid butterfly, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant flower spikes that bear numerous showy, waxy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver or gray veins. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with new growths emerging from the base of the plant. This species is popular in horticulture due to its longevity and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years."
