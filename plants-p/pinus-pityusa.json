    "intro": "Pinus pityusa, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are often covered in a layer of resin. It thrives in harsh, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
