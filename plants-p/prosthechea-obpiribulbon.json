It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in damp forests. Its thalloid structure is simple, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Prosthechea obpiribulbon plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
