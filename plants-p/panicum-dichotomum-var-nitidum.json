    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. nitidum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, forming dense clumps with upright, branched stems. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, often with a slightly rolled edge, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing panicles during the flowering season. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
