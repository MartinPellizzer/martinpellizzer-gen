    "intro": "Pleurothallis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This small orchid typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, often blooming during the rainy season. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Pleurothallis neglecta is often found in specialized botanical collections."
