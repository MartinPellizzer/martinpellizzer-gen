    "intro": "Potentilla plattensis var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the pinnatisect potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
