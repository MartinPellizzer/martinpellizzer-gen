It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
