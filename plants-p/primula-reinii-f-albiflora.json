    "intro": "Primula reinii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered primula, is a rare and striking variant of the Primula reinii species. It is characterized by its pale to almost white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, velvety foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
