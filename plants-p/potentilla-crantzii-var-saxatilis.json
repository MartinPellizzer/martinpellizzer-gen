    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, sunny conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky crevices or on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
