    "intro": "Polypodium hymenophylloides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly metallic sheen. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
