    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus echinus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a cylindrical stem covered with sharp, backward-pointing spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in spring and adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
