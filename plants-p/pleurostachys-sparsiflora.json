    "intro": "Pleurostachys sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered pleurostachys, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb with linear, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in the spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
