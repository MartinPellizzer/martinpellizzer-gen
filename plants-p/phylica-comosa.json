    "intro": "Phylica comosa, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower clusters that resemble bottle brushes, typically ranging in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grey-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phylica comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
