    "intro": "Polygala genistopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
