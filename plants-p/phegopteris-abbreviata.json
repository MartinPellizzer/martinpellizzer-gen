    "intro": "Phegopteris abbreviata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The rock polypody is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
