It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that thrives in cold, rocky environments. The leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a distinctive purple tinge on the underside, especially under certain lighting conditions. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
