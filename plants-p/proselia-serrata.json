    "intro": "Proselia serrata, commonly known as the serrated broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to host roots via haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often yellow or green in color. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
