    "intro": "Pyxidaria viscosa, commonly known as the sticky pyxidaria, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and sticky secretions on its leaves and stems. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow. The sticky substance produced by the plant may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or as a means of seed dispersal."
