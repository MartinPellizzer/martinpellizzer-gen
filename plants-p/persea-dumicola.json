    "intro": "Persea dumicola, commonly known as the desert avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a drupe with a thick, leathery exterior and a single seed inside. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
