    "intro": "Pernettya hirta, commonly known as the hairy pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and rocky slopes. Pernettya hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
