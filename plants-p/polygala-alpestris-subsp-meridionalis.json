    "intro": "Polygala alpestris subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. The plant thrives in rocky and open habitats, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
