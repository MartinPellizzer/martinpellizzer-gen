It typically grows to heights of 3 to 6 feet and is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and panicles of light green to brownish-gray seeds. This plant thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its fibrous roots help prevent erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
