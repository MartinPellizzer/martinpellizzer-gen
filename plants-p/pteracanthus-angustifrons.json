    "intro": "Pteracanthus angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteracanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
