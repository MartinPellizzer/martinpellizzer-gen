    "intro": "Popowia coursii, commonly known as the red-flowered popowia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and deciduous leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its bright red or pink flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Popowia coursii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
