    "intro": "Potentilla remota, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in groups of five, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Potentilla remota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
