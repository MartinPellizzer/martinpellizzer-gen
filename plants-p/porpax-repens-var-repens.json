It features a mat-forming growth habit with thin, fleshy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny areas."
