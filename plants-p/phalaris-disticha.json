    "intro": "Phalaris disticha, commonly known as the two-rowed beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and parts of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it its common name. Phalaris disticha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
