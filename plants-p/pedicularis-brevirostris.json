It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, and it often grows in moist, rocky habitats. The species is characterized by its short, stout stem and its ability to form dense colonies in its native environment."
