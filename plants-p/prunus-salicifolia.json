    "intro": "Prunus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are elliptical and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Prunus salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate foliage and seasonal blooms."
