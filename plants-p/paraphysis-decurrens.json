    "intro": "Paraphysis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping parsnip, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, hairy stem that grows prostrate or ascending, often forming a dense mat. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The roots are long and slender, with a mild, slightly sweet flavor, though they are not typically consumed by humans."
