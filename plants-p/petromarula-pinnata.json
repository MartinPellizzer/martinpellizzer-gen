    "intro": "Petromarula pinnata, commonly known as the coastal starflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the coastline where it is exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are pinnately arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Petromarula pinnata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
