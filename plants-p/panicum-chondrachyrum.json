    "intro": "Panicum chondrachyrum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for grasslands and restoration projects. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread and form dense stands."
