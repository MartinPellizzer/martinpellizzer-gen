    "intro": "Passerina choulettei, commonly known as the Choulette's pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its small, palmately lobed leaves are adapted to minimize water loss in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Passerina choulettei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
