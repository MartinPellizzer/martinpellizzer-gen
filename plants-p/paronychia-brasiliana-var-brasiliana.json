It is a low-growing annual herb that produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval-shaped with toothed margins. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
