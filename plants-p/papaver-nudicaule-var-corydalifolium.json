    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. corydalifolium, commonly known as the Himalayan poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive black center. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period and its ability to attract pollinators."
