It has long, cylindrical stems that often branch and are covered with small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats."
