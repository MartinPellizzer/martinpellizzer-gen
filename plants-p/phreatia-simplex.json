    "intro": "Phreatia simplex, commonly known as the simple phreatia orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it has fleshy, strap-like leaves. It is characterized by its simple and compact structure, which helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Phreatia simplex is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to certain growing conditions."
