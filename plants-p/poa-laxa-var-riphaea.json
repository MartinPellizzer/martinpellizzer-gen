    "intro": "Poa laxa var. riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Poa laxa var. riphaea is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
