    "intro": "Potentilla shockleyi, commonly known as Shockley's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are generally alternate and trifoliate. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
