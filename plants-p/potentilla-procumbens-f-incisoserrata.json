    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens f. incisoserrata, commonly known as the cut-toothed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with leaflets that have finely incised, serrated margins, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
