    "intro": "Psychotria furcans, commonly known as the sacred yew or arrow poison plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking, showy flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains toxic seeds, making it a significant plant in traditional medicine and indigenous practices. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically for its psychoactive properties and as a source of poison for hunting."
