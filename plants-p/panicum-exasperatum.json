    "intro": "Panicum exasperatum, commonly known as the rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
