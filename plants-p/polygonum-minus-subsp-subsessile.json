    "intro": "Polygonum minus subsp. subsessile, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface and a pointed tip, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, typically appearing in late summer. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
