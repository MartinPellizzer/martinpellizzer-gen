It is characterized by its oval-shaped fruits, which are typically smaller than the standard pear varieties. The plant produces small, deciduous leaves with a serrated margin and clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are edible, with a sweet and slightly acidic flavor, making it a valued species in horticulture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit."
