It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in small clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
