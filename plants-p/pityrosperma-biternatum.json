    "intro": "Pityrosperma biternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by follicles containing toxic, sticky seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
