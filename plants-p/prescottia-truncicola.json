    "intro": "Prescottia truncicola, commonly known as the Trinidadian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Trinidad. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and succulent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia truncicola is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
