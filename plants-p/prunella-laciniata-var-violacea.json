    "intro": "Prunella laciniata var. violacea, commonly known as purple dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, often tinged with purple or violet at the base. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its name reflects its historical use as a medicinal herb and its resemblance to the invasive common dead-nettle."
