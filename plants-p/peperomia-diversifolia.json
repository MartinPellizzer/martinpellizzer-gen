It features oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, making it a visually appealing houseplant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
