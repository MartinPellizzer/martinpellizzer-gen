It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
