    "intro": "Pinus culminicola var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned needles, which are typically a mix of dark green and bluish-green. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds in response to environmental cues. This variety is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
