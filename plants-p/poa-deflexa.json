    "intro": "Poa deflexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically forms a mat-like structure and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa deflexa is valued for its use in turfgrass and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
