    "intro": "Poa poiformis var. ramifer, commonly known as the ramose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often branched stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in meadows, stream banks, and other humid environments."
