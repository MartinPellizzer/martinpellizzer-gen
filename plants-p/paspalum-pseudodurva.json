    "intro": "Paspalum pseudodurva, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ability to tolerate flooding makes it an important species in wetland restoration projects."
