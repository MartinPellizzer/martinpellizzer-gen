    "intro": "Pteris pungens var. shimekii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green and often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the soil surface. The fronds are pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
