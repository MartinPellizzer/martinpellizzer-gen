    "intro": "Poa nevadensis var. juncifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
