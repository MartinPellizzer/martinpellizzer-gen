    "intro": "Psorophytum undulatum, commonly known as the crested grass or desert grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that grows in dense clumps, characterized by its wiry, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a forage plant for livestock."
