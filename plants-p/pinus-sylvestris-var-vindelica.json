    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. vindelica, commonly known as the Swedish stone pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The tree produces cones that are often woody and persistent, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber and resin production."
