    "intro": "Polypodium collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
