    "intro": "Puccinellia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Puccinellia pamirica plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
