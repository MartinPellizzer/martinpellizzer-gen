    "intro": "Pseudannona, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false annona, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. They are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruits are typically capsules that split open to release seeds, and the plants can grow as shrubs or small trees. Pseudannona species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
