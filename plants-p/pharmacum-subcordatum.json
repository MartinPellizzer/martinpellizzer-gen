    "intro": "Pharmacum subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pharmacum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies. Pharmacum subcordatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
