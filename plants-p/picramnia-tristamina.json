    "intro": "Picramnia tristamina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
