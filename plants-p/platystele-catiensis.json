    "intro": "Platystele catiensis, commonly known as the Catie's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that produces a single, ephemeral flower, which opens only briefly before withering. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Native to the cloud forests of central China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Platystele catiensis is considered an endangered species."
