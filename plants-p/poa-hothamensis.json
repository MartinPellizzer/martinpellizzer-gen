    "intro": "Poa hothamensis, commonly known as Hotham grass, is a flowering plant species native to New Zealand. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
