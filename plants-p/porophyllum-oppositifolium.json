    "intro": "Porophyllum oppositifolium, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Porophyllum oppositifolium is often used in traditional medicine and is also a source of nectar for pollinators."
