    "intro": "Pulicaria renschiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with grey-green, narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and maritime climates. Pulicaria renschiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
