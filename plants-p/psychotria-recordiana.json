    "intro": "Psychotria recordiana, commonly known as the \"Crimson Beauty\" or \"Bloodflower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Psychotria recordiana is also notable for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in tropical gardens, although it requires specific conditions to thrive."
