    "intro": "Phlegmariurus linifolius var. planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf thyme moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its flat, elongated leaves that are typically 1\u20132 mm wide and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and is often found growing on soil or rock in shaded, moist environments. Its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous, with a single, terminal capsule that is often covered in a short, persistent calyptra. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to bryologists due to its unique morphological features and ecological preferences."
