    "intro": "Philodendron tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other philodendron species. The plant has a distinctive, slender stem that often develops aerial roots, allowing it to climb towards light. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
