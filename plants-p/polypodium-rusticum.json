    "intro": "Polypodium rusticum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Polypodium rusticum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in woodland or mountainous regions."
