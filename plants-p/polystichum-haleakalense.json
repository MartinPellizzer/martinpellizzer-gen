    "intro": "Polystichum haleakalense, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 fern, is a species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase. This unique trait makes it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its habitat."
