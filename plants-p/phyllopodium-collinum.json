    "intro": "Phyllopodium collinum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phyllopodium collinum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
