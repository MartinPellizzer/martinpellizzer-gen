    "intro": "Pharnaceum serpyllifolium, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal or inland desert regions. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a characteristic species of dry, nutrient-poor habitats."
