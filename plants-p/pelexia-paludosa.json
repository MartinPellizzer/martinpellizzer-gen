    "intro": "Pelexia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pelexia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating just above the water surface. Pelexia paludosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
