    "intro": "Primula atrodentata, commonly known as the black-toothed primrose, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers, which contrast sharply with its bright green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a unique visual element to its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
