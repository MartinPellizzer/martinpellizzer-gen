    "intro": "Phoenix vigieri, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the Canary Islands. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant has feather-like, dark green leaves that are typically shorter than those of other date palms. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance. The dwarf date palm is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
