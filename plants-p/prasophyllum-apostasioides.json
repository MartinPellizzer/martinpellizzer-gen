    "intro": "Prasophyllum apostasioides, commonly known as the pink leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall flowering stem with a single, showy pink or purple flower. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found at high altitudes. The species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and climate change impacts."
