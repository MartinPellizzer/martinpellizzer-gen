    "intro": "Palmorchis liberolabellata, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of Georgia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fibrous root system and a single, fleshy, leaf-like structure that serves as a photosynthetic organ. The plant produces a single, showy, white or pale green flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. It is closely associated with specific habitats, particularly those with high water tables and nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
