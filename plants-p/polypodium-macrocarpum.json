    "intro": "Polypodium macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, serving as a storage organ for nutrients and water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct patterns."
