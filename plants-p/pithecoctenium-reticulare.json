It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate net-like vein patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Pithecoctenium reticulare is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
