    "intro": "Pandanus cylindricus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of palm native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional crafts, and the plant is adapted to coastal and tropical environments. Pandanus cylindricus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
