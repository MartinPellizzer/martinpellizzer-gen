    "intro": "Ptilosia apargioides, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native habitat."
