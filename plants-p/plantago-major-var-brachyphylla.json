    "intro": "Plantago major var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. This variety is closely related to other plantain species and is valued for its medicinal and ecological benefits."
