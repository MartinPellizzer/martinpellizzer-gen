    "intro": "Parthenocissus quinquefolia, commonly known as Virginia creeper, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with five leaflets, which turn bright red in the autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is often used in landscaping for its vigorous growth and seasonal color changes. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may cause skin irritation."
