    "intro": "Potentilla pusilla var. viridis, commonly known as green potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slight woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
