    "intro": "Polygala cuspidulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
