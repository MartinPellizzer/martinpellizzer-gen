It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
