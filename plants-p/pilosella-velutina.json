It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in meadows and dry grasslands. Pilosella velutina is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in some regions."
