    "intro": "Prevostea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The botanical features of Prevostea ferruginea make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
