It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with serrated edges and a grayish-green color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands."
