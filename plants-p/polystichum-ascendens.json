    "intro": "Polystichum ascendens, commonly known as the ascending wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a delicate appearance. Polystichum ascendens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
