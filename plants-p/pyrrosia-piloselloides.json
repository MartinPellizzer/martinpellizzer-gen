    "intro": "Pyrrosia piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pyrrosia piloselloides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
