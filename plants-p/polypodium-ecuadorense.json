    "intro": "Polypodium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
