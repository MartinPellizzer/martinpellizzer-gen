It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia anomala is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
