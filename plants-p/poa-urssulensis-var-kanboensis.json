    "intro": "Poa urssulensis var. kanboensis, commonly known as the Kanboan grass, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
