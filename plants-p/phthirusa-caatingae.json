    "intro": "Phthirusa caatingae, commonly known as the caatinga phthirus, is a species of flowering plant native to the caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem."
