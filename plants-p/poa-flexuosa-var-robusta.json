    "intro": "Poa flexuosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form dense mats."
