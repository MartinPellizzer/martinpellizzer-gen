The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Phragmipedium hirtzii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
