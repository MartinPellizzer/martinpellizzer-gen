    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. pseudouncinata, commonly known as the European stone pine, is a variant of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted, and gnarled trunk, which gives it a rugged appearance. The tree produces large, edible pine nuts, which are a valuable resource in some regions. Its needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to the standard Scots pine, and it is often found in mountainous or rocky areas. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is relatively slow-growing, making it a long-lived species."
