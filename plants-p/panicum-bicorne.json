    "intro": "Panicum bicorne, commonly known as the spurred grass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear distinctive bracts with forward-pointing teeth, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Panicum bicorne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
