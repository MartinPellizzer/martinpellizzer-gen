It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with glandular dots that give it its scientific name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
