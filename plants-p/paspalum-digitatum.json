    "intro": "Paspalum digitatum, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, finger-like cluster of spikelets, giving it its common name. Paspalum digitatum is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
