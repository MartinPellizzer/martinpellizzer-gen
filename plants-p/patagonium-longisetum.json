    "intro": "Patagonium longisetum, commonly known as the long-hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
