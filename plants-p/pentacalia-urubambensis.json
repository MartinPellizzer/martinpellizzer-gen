    "intro": "Pentacalia urubambensis, commonly known as the Urubambensis pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a compact inflorescence, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pentacalia urubambensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
