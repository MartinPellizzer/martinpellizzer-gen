    "intro": "Potentilla gaudinii f. murriana, commonly known as the Murranan cinquefoil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions."
