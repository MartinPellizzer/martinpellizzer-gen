    "intro": "Photinia integrifolia var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southwestern China. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
