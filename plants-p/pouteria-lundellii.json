It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits with a sweet, acidic pulp. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, while the tree's wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Pouteria lundellii thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests."
