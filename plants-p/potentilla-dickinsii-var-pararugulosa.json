    "intro": "Potentilla dickinsii var. pararugulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. The variety pararugulosa is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf silvering and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form."
