    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum innubum, commonly known as the clouded lily, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are adapted to the cold, windy conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which may aid in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paraprasophyllum innubum is considered a vulnerable species."
