    "intro": "Paspalidium tuyamae, commonly known as the Tuyama's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Paspalidium tuyamae plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
