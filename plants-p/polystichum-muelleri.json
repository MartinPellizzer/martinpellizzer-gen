    "intro": "Polystichum muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the cool, moist forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It prefers shaded, well-drained soils and is often found growing in mountainous regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
