    "intro": "Poa alpigena f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils at high elevations. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky, alpine habitats."
