    "intro": "Polybotrya espiritosantensis, commonly known as the Espiritosanto fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
