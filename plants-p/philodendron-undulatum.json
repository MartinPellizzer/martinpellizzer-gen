    "intro": "Philodendron undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Philodendron undulatum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
