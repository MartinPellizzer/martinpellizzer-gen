    "intro": "Pinus hoseriana, commonly known as the Hoser's pine, is a rare and critically endangered species native to a small region in central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dark purple cones that mature over several years, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
