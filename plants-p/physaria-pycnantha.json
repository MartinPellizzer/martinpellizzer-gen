    "intro": "Physaria pycnantha, commonly known as the sticky rocket or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are linear and often covered in a sticky substance. Physaria pycnantha thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which contributes to its reproductive success in its native habitat."
