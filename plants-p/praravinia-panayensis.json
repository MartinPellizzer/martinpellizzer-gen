    "intro": "Praravinia panayensis, commonly known as the Panay bamboo or Panay rattan, is a climbing plant native to the island of Panay in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant is known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate forest understories in its native habitat. Praravinia panayensis is valued for its fibrous material, which has been traditionally used in basket-making and other crafts. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
