    "intro": "Phyllanthus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are characterized by their unique cordate shape and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
