    "intro": "Potentilla argentea proles pseudoargentea, commonly known as the silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silver-white leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
