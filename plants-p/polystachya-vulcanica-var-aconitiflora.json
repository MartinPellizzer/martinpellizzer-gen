    "intro": "Polystachya vulcanica var. aconitiflora, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of dark purple to violet flowers that resemble the shape of a helmet. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
