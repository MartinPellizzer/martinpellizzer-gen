    "intro": "Polypodium elatius, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's ability to colonize difficult substrates makes it an important indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat."
