    "intro": "Parkia versteeghii, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization, it is sometimes cultivated in reforestation projects."
