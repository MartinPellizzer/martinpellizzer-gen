    "intro": "Psoralea cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, which are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, often blooming from late summer to autumn. Psoralea cordata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in dry conditions."
