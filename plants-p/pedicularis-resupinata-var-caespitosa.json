    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. Its leaves are opposite and oval, while its stems are often clustered, giving it its varietal name. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
