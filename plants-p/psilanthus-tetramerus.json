    "intro": "Psilanthus tetramerus, commonly known as the four-toothed acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of traditional medicine."
