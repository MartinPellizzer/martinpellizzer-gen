    "intro": "Polypodium aquilinum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or walls. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium aquilinum is known for its hardiness and ability to colonize difficult habitats."
