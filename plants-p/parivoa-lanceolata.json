    "intro": "Parivoa lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf parivoa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Parivoa lanceolata is often found in high-altitude grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
