    "intro": "Poa hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Poa hieronymi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
