It is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are flexible and often twine around supporting structures. Pentaphylloides floribunda is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
