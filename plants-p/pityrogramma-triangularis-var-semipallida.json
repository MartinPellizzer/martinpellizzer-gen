    "intro": "Pityrogramma triangularis var. semipallida, commonly known as the pale lichen fern, is a variant of the triangular water fern. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, triangular fronds with a pale, almost whitish underside, distinguishing it from other varieties. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
