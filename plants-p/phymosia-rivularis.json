    "intro": "Phymosia rivularis, commonly known as the river wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the humid environments it inhabits. Phymosia rivularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native insects and birds."
