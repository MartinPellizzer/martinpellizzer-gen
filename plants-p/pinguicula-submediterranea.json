    "intro": "Pinguicula submediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
