    "intro": "Premna derryana, commonly known as the silverleaf premna, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
