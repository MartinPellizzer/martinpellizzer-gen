    "intro": "Picea retroflexa, commonly known as the Alaska cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Picea retroflexa thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
