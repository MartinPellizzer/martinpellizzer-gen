It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shady areas such as woodland edges and meadows. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance."
