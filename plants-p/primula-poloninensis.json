    "intro": "Primula poloninensis, commonly known as the Polish alpine primrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
