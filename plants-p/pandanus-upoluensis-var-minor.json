    "intro": "Pandanus upoluensis var. minor, commonly known as the Upolu pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the Pandanaceae family. It is native to the island of Upolu in Samoa and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, which are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its fibrous leaves are also valued for their strength and durability, making them useful in weaving. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Pandanus upoluensis."
