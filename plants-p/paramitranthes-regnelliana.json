It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant has a short flowering period and is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of rainforests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it faces significant conservation challenges."
