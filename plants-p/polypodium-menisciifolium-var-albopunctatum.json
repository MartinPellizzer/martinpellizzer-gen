    "intro": "Polypodium menisciifolium var. albopunctatum, commonly known as the white-spotted holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with distinctive white or silver spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
