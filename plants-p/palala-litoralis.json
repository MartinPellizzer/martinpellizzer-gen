    "intro": "Palala litoralis, commonly known as the coastal palala, is a rare flowering plant native to the sandy shores of Southeast Asia. It thrives in coastal environments, where it is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Palala litoralis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
