It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its root is cylindrical and often has a white or yellowish color, with a strong, spicy aroma. Pastinaca incana is also known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
