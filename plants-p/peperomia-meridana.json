    "intro": "Peperomia meridana, commonly known as the rock peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Peperomia meridana thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
