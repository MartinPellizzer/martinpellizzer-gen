It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
