    "intro": "Polygala pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, usually green or yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
