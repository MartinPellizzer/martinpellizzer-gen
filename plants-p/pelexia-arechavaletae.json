    "intro": "Pelexia arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
