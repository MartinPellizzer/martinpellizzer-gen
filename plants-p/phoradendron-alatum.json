    "intro": "Phoradendron alatum, commonly known as the flying lion's tail, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that resemble small, clustered lanterns. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite long as it climbs trees. Phoradendron alatum is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory."
