    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. alpigava, commonly known as the alpine silverweed, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds."
