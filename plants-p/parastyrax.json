    "intro": "Parastyrax, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Parastyrax species are often shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, hard fruits that contain seeds. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments, making them an important component of local ecosystems."
