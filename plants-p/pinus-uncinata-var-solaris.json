    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. solaris, commonly known as the sun pine, is a variant of the serotinous pine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically a vibrant green, with a slightly bluish tinge. The cones of this variety are often larger and more robust compared to the standard Pinus uncinata, and they remain closed for several years before opening to release their seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient species within the pine family."
