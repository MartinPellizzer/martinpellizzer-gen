    "intro": "Pochota, commonly known as the \"chocolate tree,\" is a species native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain small, dark brown seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Pochota is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display. However, it is not typically grown for its fruit or seeds due to their limited commercial use."
