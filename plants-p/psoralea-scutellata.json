    "intro": "Psoralea scutellata, commonly known as the narrowleaf psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Psoralea scutellata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
