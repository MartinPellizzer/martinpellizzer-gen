    "intro": "Peddiea zenkeri, commonly known as the Zanzibar violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually ovate and have a glossy surface, while its stems are often woody and branched. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Peddiea zenkeri is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
