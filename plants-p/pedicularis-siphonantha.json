It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is often found at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
