    "intro": "Potentilla palustris var. genuina, commonly known as the marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
