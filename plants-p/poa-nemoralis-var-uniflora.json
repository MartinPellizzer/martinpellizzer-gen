    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The variety uniflora is distinguished by its single flower per spikelet, setting it apart from other variants of Poa nemoralis."
