    "intro": "Psidium reversum, commonly known as the reverse guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries similar to guavas but with a more acidic flavor. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental purposes. Psidium reversum is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
