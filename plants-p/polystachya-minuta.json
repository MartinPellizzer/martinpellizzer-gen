    "intro": "Polystachya minuta, commonly known as the dwarf flame orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features delicate, hairy stems and produces clusters of tiny, brightly colored flowers that resemble miniature flames. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs that help retain moisture. Polystachya minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
