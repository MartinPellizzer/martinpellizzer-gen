    "intro": "Phyteuma scorzonerifolium var. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
