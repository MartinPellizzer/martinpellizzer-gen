    "intro": "Pteris amoena, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Pteris amoena thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance."
