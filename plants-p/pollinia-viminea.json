    "intro": "Pollinia viminea, commonly known as the slender pollinia orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are elongated and thread-like structures that adhere to the insect vectors for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow hue, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
