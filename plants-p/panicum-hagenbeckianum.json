    "intro": "Panicum hagenbeckianum, commonly known as the Hagenbeck's panic grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, light green to golden-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features include narrow, blade-like leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late summer to early autumn. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
