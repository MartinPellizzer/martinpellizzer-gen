    "intro": "Pleopeltis uchiyamae, commonly known as the Uchiyama's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous roots that anchor it to its substrate. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pleopeltis uchiyamae is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests."
