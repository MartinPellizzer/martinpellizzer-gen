    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens var. longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and 1\u20132 mm wide, with long, flexible petioles that allow it to remain buoyant in water. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable aquatic habitats."
