    "intro": "Potentilla sordida var. humifusa, commonly known as the gloomy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
