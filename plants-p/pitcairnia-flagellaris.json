    "intro": "Pitcairnia flagellaris, commonly known as the sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the leaf axils, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse gardens."
