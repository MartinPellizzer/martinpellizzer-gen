    "intro": "Panicum rubrum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted clusters of red-bracted inflorescences. The plant produces small, delicate florets that are typically reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Panicum rubrum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself naturally."
