    "intro": "Petalostemon glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular petalostemon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
