    "intro": "Pisum nissolia, commonly known as the Nissolia pea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the legume family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of many pea species. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Native to specific regions in Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity rather than a widely cultivated crop."
