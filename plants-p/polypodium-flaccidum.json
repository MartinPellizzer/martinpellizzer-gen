    "intro": "Polypodium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often curl when dry. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name."
