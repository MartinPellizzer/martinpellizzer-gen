    "intro": "Pouteria dictyoneura var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits containing one or two edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in the rainforest ecosystem and its economic importance as a source of the valuable Brazil nut."
