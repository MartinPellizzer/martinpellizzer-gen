    "intro": "Panicum calumet, commonly known as sacred grass or cupid's dart, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicle-shaped inflorescences that produce small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It has cultural significance among indigenous communities, particularly the Seminole and Creek tribes, who used it in ceremonial practices."
