    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. lanceolata, commonly known as the American balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically serrated and have a bluish-white underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often has a distinctive white, aromatic resinous sap. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along rivers and streams."
