    "intro": "Pteris umbraculifera, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
