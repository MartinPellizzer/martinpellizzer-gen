    "intro": "Phacelia insularis, commonly known as the island phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. It has small, ovate leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phacelia insularis is considered a rare and endangered species."
