    "intro": "Platanthera unalascensis subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale green flowers. This subshrub thrives in moist, coastal environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is typically found in open, sunny habitats near the shoreline. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
