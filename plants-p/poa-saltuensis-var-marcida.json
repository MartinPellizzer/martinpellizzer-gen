    "intro": "Poa saltuensis var. marcida, commonly known as the salt meadow grass, is a variant of the saltgrass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils with high salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in salt-affected areas."
