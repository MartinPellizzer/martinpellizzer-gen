    "intro": "Phyllanthus oxycarpus, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to green, spherical berries which turn orange-red when mature. The berries are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients, making the plant valuable in traditional medicine and nutrition. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
