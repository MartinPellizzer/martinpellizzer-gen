    "intro": "Poa salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes help stabilize soils in salty, coastal areas, making it an important pioneer species in such habitats. Poa salina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
