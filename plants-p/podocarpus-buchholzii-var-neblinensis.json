    "intro": "Podocarpus buchholzii var. neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's podocarp, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, upward-curving cones. The plant typically grows in humid, cool climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and have a subtle aromatic scent, which is a common trait among the Podocarpaceae family. This variant is notable for its ecological significance in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
