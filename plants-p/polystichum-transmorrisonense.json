    "intro": "Polystichum transmorrisonense, commonly known as the Morrison's wood fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its mountainous habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
