It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a stout, hollow stem with rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are typically yellowish or brownish, arranged in a spherical cluster, and it produces small, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal.
