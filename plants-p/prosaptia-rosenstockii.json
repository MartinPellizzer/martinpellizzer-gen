    "intro": "Prosaptia rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenthal's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, slender stem and a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Prosaptia rosenstockii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
