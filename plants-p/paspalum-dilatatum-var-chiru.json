    "intro": "Paspalum dilatatum var. chiru, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or Chiru grass, is a perennial bunchgrass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. This species is often used for grazing by livestock and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
