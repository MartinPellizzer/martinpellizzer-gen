    "intro": "Pseudocedrela excelsa, commonly known as African teak, is a tall, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
