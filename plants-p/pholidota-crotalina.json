It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking spadix inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable conditions. Pholidota crotalina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
