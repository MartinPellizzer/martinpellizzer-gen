    "intro": "Paspalum heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and landscaping in dry regions. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
