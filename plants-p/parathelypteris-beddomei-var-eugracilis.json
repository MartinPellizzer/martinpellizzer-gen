    "intro": "Parathelypteris beddomei var. eugracilis, commonly known as the slender fringed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
