    "intro": "Panax heyneanus, commonly known as the Heyne's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red berries. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
