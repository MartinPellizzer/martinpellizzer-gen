    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. elatior, commonly known as the greater wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers. This variety is distinguished by its slightly taller growth compared to the typical Poa nemoralis."
