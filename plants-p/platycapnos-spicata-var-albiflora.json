    "intro": "Platycapnos spicata var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflowered spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its showy, long-lasting floral display."
