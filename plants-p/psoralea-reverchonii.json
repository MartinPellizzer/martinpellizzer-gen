    "intro": "Psoralea reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
