    "intro": "Pilosella stuposa, commonly known as the showy pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features silky, white to pale yellow hairs on its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella stuposa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
