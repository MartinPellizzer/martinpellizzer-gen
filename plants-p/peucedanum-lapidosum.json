    "intro": "Peucedanum lapidosum, commonly known as stone angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its seeds are small and covered in a fine, hairy coating, aiding in wind dispersal. Peucedanum lapidosum is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
