    "intro": "Platanthera replicata, commonly known as the northern ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
