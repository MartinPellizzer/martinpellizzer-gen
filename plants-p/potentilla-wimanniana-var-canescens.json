    "intro": "Potentilla wimanniana var. canescens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
