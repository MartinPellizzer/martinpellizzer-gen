    "intro": "Phalaris arundinacea, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense tufts or mats, often reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is often found in wet or marshy habitats. Phalaris arundinacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket-making and thatching."
