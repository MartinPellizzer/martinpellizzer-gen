    "intro": "Pilea serpyllacea, commonly known as the creeping pilea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ground cover in horticultural settings."
