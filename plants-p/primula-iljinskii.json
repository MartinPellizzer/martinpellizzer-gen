    "intro": "Primula iljinskii, commonly known as the Iljinskii primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
