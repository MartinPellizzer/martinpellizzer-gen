    "intro": "Podochilus australiensis, commonly known as the Australian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, translucent petals and a slender, wiry stem. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
