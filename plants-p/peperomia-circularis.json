    "intro": "Peperomia circularis, commonly known as the Round-leaf Peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are round to oval in shape, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant."
