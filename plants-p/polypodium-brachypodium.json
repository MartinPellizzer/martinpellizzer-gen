    "intro": "Polypodium brachypodium, commonly known as the short-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium brachypodium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
