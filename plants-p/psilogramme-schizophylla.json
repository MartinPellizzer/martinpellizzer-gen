    "intro": "Psilogramme schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
