    "intro": "Populus nigra subsp. betulifolia, commonly known as the black poplar or European poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind, contributing to its natural range. It often grows in moist soils along riverbanks and in floodplains, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for reforestation and ornamental use."
