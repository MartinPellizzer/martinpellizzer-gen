    "intro": "Phloeophila condorana, commonly known as the Andean phloeophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its growth is slow, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem despite its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
