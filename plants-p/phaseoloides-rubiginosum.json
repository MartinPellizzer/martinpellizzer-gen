    "intro": "Phaseoloides rubiginosum, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth habit and climbing nature make it a common weed in agricultural fields. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature."
