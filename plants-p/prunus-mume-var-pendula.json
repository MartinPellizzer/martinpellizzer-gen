    "intro": "Prunus mume var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, which are followed by ornamental pink or red fruits. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy surface and turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
