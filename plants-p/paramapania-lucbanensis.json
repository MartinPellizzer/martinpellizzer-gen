    "intro": "Paramapania lucbanensis, commonly known as the Lucban mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paramapania lucbanensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
