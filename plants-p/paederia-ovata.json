    "intro": "Paederia ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Paederia ovata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical properties remain understudied."
