    "intro": "Puya brittoniana, commonly known as the Chilean torch, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette formation, which helps it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Puya brittoniana is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy."
