    "intro": "Phaiosperma trifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, slender rhizomes that help it anchor in the substrate and spread vegetatively. Its fronds are broad and lance-shaped, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration."
