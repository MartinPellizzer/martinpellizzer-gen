    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 wolfii, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla \u00d7 wolfii is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
