    "intro": "Polypodium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
