    "intro": "Pedicularis fletcheri, commonly known as Fletcher's lousewort, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This species is characterized by its spurred flowers and hairy stems, adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
