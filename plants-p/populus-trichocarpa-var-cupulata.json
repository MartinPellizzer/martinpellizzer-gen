    "intro": "Populus trichocarpa var. cupulata, commonly known as the western balsam poplar, is a variant of the black poplar native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped inflorescences and heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams and wetlands. It has smooth, light green bark that becomes fissured with age, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its potential for use in reforestation efforts."
