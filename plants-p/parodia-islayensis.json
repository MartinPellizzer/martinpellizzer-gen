    "intro": "Parodia islayensis, commonly known as the Islay cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, globular plant with a short, thick stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
