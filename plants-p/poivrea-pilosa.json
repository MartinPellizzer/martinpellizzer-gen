    "intro": "Poivrea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy privet, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental landscaping. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
