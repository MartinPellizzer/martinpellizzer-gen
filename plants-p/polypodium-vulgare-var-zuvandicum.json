    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. zuvandicum, commonly known as the Zuvandicum Shield Fern, is a rare variant of the common shield fern. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-bearing structures called sori located on the underside. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
