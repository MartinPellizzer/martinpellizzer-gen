    "intro": "Pothos versteegii, commonly known as the Versteeg's devil's ivy, is a tropical climbing plant native to Madagascar. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Pothos versteegii is a popular houseplant due to its hardiness and ability to purify indoor air."
