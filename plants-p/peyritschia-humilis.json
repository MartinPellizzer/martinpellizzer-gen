    "intro": "Peyritschia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf peyritschia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. It is adapted to dry climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Peyritschia humilis is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant for its low-growing habit and resilience."
