    "intro": "Peristylus albidulus, commonly known as the white-flowered peristylus, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Peristylus albidulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
