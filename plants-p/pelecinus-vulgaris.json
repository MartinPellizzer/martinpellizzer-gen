    "intro": "Pelecinus vulgaris, commonly known as the narrow-winged beetle, is a member of the family Pelecanidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and long, tapering legs, which are adapted for life in aquatic environments. The plant-associated aspects of this species are minimal, as it is not a plant but an insect. However, it is often found in association with aquatic plants, where it lays its eggs. Its life cycle involves aquatic larvae and adult beetles that inhabit moist environments near water bodies."
