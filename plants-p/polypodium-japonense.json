    "intro": "Polypodium japonense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, providing protection to the fertile spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots. Polypodium japonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
