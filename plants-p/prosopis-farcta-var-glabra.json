    "intro": "Prosopis farcta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, woody pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. This species is valued for its role in desert ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and construction."
