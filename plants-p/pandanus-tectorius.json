    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius, commonly known as the hala tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional thatching. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots and leaves are utilized in various cultural and practical applications, including basket weaving and as a source of fiber. The hala tree thrives in coastal and wetland environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
