It is characterized by its drooping, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This grass is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique visual appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
