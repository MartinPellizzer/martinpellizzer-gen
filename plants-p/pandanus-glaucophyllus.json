    "intro": "Pandanus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils, making it important for erosion control. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures."
