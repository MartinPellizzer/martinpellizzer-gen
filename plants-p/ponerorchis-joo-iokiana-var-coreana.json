    "intro": "Ponerorchis joo-iokiana var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high elevation and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
