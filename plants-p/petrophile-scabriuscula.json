It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland heathlands. It produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Petrophile scabriuscula is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
