    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. elatius, commonly known as the tall pea, is a cultivated variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and longer stems compared to standard garden peas. The plant produces green, edible pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in cooking. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This trait makes it a valuable crop for soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
