    "intro": "Parathelypteris nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
