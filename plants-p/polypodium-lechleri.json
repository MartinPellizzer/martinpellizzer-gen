    "intro": "Polypodium lechleri, commonly known as the \"dragon's blood tree,\" is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds and distinctive, clustered rhizomes. The plant is renowned for its sap, which is a deep red resin used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The sap contains high concentrations of anthraquinones, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
