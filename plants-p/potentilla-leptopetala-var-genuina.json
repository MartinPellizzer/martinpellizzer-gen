    "intro": "Potentilla leptopetala var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
