    "intro": "Pyrus harziana, commonly known as the Harz pear, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or mountainous areas. The Harz pear is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional European horticulture."
