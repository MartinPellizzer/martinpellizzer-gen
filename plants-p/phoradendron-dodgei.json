    "intro": "Phoradendron dodgei, commonly known as the Dodges' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for various insects and birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume its berries, facilitating its spread across different host trees."
