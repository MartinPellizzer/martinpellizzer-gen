    "intro": "Pyrus subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, edible pomes that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
