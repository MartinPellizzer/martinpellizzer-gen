    "intro": "Pouzolzia arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem rockfig, is a small, woody shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
