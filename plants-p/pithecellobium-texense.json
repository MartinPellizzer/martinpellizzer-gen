    "intro": "Pithecellobium texense, commonly known as the Texas acacia, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Pithecellobium texense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
