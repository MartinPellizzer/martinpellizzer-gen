    "intro": "Paracaryum lithospermifolium subsp. cariense, commonly known as the Cariense Paracaryum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often leathery leaves that exhibit a range of colors depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as mountain forests, where it plays a role in local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
