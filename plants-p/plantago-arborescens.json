    "intro": "Plantago arborescens, commonly known as tree plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal spikes, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
