    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. riojensis, commonly known as the Riojense Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Argentina. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by pale green fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
