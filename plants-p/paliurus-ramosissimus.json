It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a tart taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in horticulture and traditional medicine."
