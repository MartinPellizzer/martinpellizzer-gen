    "intro": "Ponerorchis graminifolia var. nigropunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green flowers with distinctive black spots on the petals. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
