    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. scabrida, commonly known as the scaly white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive scaly bark, which gives it its specific epithet \"scabrida.\" The leaves are typically short, needle-like, and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh mountainous climates. This subspecies is valued for its timber and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
