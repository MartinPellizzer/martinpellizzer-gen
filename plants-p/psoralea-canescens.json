    "intro": "Psoralea canescens, commonly known as the white psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
