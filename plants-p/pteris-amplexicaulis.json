    "intro": "Pteris amplexicaulis, commonly known as the curled-leaf brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or lobed margin. Pteris amplexicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
