    "intro": "Pitcairnia quesnelioides, commonly known as the Quesnel's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
