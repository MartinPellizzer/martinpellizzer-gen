    "intro": "Papaver alpinum subsp. rhaeticum, commonly known as the Alpine poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Papaver alpinum species."
