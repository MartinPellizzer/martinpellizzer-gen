It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces pome fruits, which are typically sweet and juicy, with a thin, edible skin. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. The plant is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its culinary uses."
