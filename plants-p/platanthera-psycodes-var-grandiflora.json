    "intro": "Platanthera psycodes var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
