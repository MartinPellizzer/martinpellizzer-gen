    "intro": "Poa leptostachya, commonly known as slender-stalked bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
