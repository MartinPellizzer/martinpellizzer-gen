    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 petrovskoe-rasumovskoe, commonly known as the Petrovskoe-Rasumovskoe poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera. It is characterized by its fast growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it suitable for reforestation and windbreak projects. The tree typically reaches heights of 20 to 30 meters and has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This hybrid is valued for its ecological benefits and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
