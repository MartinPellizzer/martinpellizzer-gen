The tree produces small, round fruits with a rough, greenish-brown skin and a creamy, nutty-flavored pulp. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense canopy and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Persea montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
