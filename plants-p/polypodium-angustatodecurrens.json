    "intro": "Polypodium angustatodecurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. It reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia."
