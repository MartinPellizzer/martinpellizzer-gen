    "intro": "Papaver tineoi, commonly known as the Tineo poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers with intricate, papery petals that resemble those of other poppy species. Its seeds are small and often used in traditional medicine in its native regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
