    "intro": "Pedicularis umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its striking appearance makes it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
