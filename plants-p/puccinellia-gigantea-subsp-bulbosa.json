    "intro": "Puccinellia gigantea subsp. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous wildrye, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, bulbous base that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences with spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in dryland ecosystems."
