    "intro": "Pedicularis karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers. Its leaves are alternate and often have a hairy texture, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
