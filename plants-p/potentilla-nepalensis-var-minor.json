    "intro": "Potentilla nepalensis var. minor, commonly known as the Himalayan cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
