    "intro": "Polypodium bipinnatifidum var. foersteri, commonly known as the Foerster's shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments. The fronds are typically light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive species within the Polypodiaceae family."
