    "intro": "Pilocereus piauhyensis, commonly known as the Piauhy night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spines, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store moisture efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Pilocereus piauhyensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
