    "intro": "Pycnandra decandra subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pycnandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
