It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
