    "intro": "Penaea linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean's penaea, is a lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Penaea linnaei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
