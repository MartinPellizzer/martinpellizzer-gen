    "intro": "Pulegium vulgare f. algeriense, commonly known as Algerian pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, particularly pulegone, which contribute to its strong, mint-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional remedies."
