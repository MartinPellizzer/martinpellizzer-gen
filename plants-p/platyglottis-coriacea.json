    "intro": "Platyglottis coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leafed glottis, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
