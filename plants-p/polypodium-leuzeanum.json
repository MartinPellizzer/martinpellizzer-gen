    "intro": "Polypodium leuzeanum, commonly known as the rock fern or leuzea fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and creeping rhizomes that allow it to form thick mats on rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
