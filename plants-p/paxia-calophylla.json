    "intro": "Paxia calophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paxia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Paxia calophylla is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment."
