    "intro": "Pteris anopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Pteris anopteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover."
