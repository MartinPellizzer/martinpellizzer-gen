    "intro": "Phreatia louisiadum, commonly known as the Louisiade phreatia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Louisiade Archipelago. This epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it store water in its native habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia louisiadum is considered a rare and endangered species."
