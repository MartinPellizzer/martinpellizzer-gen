It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Panicum stuhlmannii is typically drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in regions with limited water availability."
