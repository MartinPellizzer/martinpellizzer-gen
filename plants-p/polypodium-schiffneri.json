    "intro": "Polypodium schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. Polypodium schiffneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
