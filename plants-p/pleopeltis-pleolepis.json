    "intro": "Pleopeltis pleolepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
