    "intro": "Phlebodium araneosum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is not consistently observed in Phlebodium araneosum."
