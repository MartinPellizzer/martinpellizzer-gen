    "intro": "Picea lowii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dark blue-green needles that are arranged in clusters of five. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea lowii is well adapted to high-altitude environments, with slow growth rates and long lifespans, often exceeding 3,000 years. Its dense foliage and resinous sap provide natural defenses against pests and environmental stressors."
