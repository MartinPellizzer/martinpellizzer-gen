    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 queenii, commonly known as the ivy-leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth. Pelargonium \u00d7 queenii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants."
