It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that often curve downward. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and thatching, while its roots have medicinal properties. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it resilient to saltwater and flooding."
