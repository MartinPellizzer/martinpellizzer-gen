It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
