    "intro": "Pyrus autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5-10 meters and features broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
