    "intro": "Paspalum falcatum, commonly known as flatleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum falcatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
