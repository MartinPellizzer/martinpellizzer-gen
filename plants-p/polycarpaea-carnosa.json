    "intro": "Polycarpaea carnosa, commonly known as the woolly polycarpaea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Polycarpaea carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
