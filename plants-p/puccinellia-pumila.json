    "intro": "Puccinellia pumila, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes. Puccinellia pumila is also used in livestock forage due to its nutritional value and hardiness."
