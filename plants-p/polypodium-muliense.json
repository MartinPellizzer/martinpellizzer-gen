    "intro": "Polypodium muliense, commonly known as the Muli fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are usually pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium muliense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
