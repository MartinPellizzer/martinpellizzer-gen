    "intro": "Paspalum procerum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-ranked spikelets. Paspalum procerum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
