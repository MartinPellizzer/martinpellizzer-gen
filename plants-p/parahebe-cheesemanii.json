    "intro": "Parahebe cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman\u2019s parahebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
