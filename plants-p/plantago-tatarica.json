    "intro": "Plantago tatarica, commonly known as Siberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on a slender stem. Its fibrous root system is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
