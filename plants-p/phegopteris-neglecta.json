    "intro": "Phegopteris neglecta, commonly known as the common cliffbrake, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris neglecta plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
