    "intro": "Pelargonium hilare, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers. The plant is well-suited for containers and rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Pelargonium hilare is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
