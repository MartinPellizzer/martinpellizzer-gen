    "intro": "Ptelea mesochora, commonly known as the western ash or red ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a reddish color. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Ptelea mesochora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates."
