    "intro": "Poa compressa var. sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fine texture and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in natural habitats."
