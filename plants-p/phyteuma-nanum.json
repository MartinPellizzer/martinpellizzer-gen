    "intro": "Phyteuma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf phyteuma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
