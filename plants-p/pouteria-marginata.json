It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces elongated, woody pods that contain the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and healthy fats. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
