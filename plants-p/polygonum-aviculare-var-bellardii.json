    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. bellardii, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily along the ground. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating and a serrated margin. Small, greenish-white flowers are produced in clusters, typically during the summer months. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
