    "intro": "Polypodium infra-planicostale, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
