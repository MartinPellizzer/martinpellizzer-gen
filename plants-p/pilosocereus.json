    "intro": "Pilosocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with flowers that open at night. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with thick, fleshy stems for water storage. The flowers are often large, showy, and fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Pilosocereus species are popular among cactus enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and resilience."
