    "intro": "Pseudocodon, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true dandelions. The plants typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Pseudocodon species are herbaceous perennials, and their leaves are usually covered in fine hairs. The genus includes several species, such as Pseudocodon filifolius, which is native to southern Europe and western Asia."
