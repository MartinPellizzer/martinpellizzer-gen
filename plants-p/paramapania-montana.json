    "intro": "Paramapania montana, commonly known as the mountain paramapania, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Paramapania montana is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters."
