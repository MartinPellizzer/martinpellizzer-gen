    "intro": "Promenaea rollissonii, commonly known as the Rollisson's pterostigma. This tropical plant is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its distinctive wing-like leaves that resemble the shape of bird wings. The leaves are typically green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in forest understories. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
