    "intro": "Pedilonum wentianum, commonly known as the Chinese walking fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
