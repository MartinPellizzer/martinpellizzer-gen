    "intro": "Paepalanthus oyapockensis, commonly known as the Amazonian night-blooming orchid, is a striking plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a tall, slender stem with a single, large, white or pale pink flower that emits a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
