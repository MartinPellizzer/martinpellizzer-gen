    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the\u4e1c\u65b9 plane tree (Platanus orientalis). It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark and broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain three or four seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is widely cultivated for its tolerance to urban conditions, including pollution and compacted soils, making it a popular choice for city landscapes."
