    "intro": "Psoralea speciosa, commonly known as the showy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits. Psoralea speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
