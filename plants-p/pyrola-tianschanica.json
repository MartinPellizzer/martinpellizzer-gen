    "intro": "Pyrola tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan flameflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shaded, moist environments. Pyrola tianschanica is adapted to cold climates and thrives in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
