    "intro": "Poa lavrenkoi, commonly known as the Lavrenko's meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa lavrenkoi is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
