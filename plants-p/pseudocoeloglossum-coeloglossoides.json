    "intro": "Pseudocoeloglossum coeloglossoides, commonly known as the false coeloglossum, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a lanceolate shape. Its spores are released from terminal clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
