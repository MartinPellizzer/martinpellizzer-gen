    "intro": "Polysphaeria arbuscula, commonly known as the hairy polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and often hairy texture on its cap surface. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is covered with small, rounded pores. Polysphaeria arbuscula is often found in association with hardwood trees, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems."
