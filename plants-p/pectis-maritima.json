    "intro": "Pectis maritima, commonly known as sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Pectis maritima is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
