    "intro": "Persicaria coccinea f. natans, commonly known as floating heart, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often red or pink in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can spread easily by means of its rhizomes. The plant's foliage remains just above the water surface, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding visual interest to its aquatic habitat. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
