    "intro": "Penstemon alsinoides, commonly known as the sand penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Penstemon alsinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions."
