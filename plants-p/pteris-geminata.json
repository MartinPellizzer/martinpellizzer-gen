    "intro": "Pteris geminata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two symmetrical halves, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. Pteris geminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
