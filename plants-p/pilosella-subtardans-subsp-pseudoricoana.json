    "intro": "Pilosella subtardans subsp. pseudoricoana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky and dry habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
