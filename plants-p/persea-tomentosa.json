    "intro": "Persea tomentosa, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or butter avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree bears large, pear-shaped fruits with a thick, creamy pulp that is rich in healthy fats. The fruit's pericarp is covered with a dense, white, woolly coating when immature. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritious fruit and ornamental value."
