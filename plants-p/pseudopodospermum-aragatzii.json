    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum aragatzii, commonly known as the Armenian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
