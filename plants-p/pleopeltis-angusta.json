    "intro": "Pleopeltis angusta, commonly known as the narrow pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
