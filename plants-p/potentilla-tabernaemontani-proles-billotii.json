    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani proles billotii, commonly known as the Billot's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme and attract various pollinators. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
