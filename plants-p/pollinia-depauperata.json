    "intro": "Pollinia depauperata, commonly known as the poor pollen orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique structure, with pollinia that are reduced in size and number compared to other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a complex arrangement that facilitates specialized pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
