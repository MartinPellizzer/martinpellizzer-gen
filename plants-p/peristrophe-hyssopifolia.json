    "intro": "Peristrophe hyssopifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false hyssop, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped environments."
