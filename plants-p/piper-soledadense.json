It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around other vegetation. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white in color. The fruit, which is a small, round berry, contains several seeds and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
