    "intro": "Plantago argentea, commonly known as silver plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
