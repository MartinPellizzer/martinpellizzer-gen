    "intro": "Platanthera ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
