    "intro": "Psidium musarum, commonly known as the small passionfruit, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The fruit's interior contains a juicy, aromatic pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to its tart flavor."
