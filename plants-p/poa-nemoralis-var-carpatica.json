    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
