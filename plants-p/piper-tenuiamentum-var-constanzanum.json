    "intro": "Piper tenuiamentum var. constanzanum, commonly known as the Constantza pepper, is a variant of the Piper tenuiamentum species native to South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. The berries are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit."
