    "intro": "Periballia hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish ball flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive spherical flower heads. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Periballia hispanica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
