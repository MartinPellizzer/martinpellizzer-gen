    "intro": "Picramnia antidesma subsp. nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is typically found in moist, tropical lowland forests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its range."
