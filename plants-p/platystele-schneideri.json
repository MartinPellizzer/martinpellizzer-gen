    "intro": "Platystele schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. The plant features a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered."
