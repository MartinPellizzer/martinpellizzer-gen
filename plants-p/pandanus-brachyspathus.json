    "intro": "Pandanus brachyspathus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-like leaves that grow in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the center of the leaf rosette. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in coastal and wetland areas. Pandanus brachyspathus is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
