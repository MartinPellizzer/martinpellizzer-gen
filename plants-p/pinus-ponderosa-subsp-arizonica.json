It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of two. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
