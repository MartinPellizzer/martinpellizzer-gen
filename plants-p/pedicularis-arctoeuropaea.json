    "intro": "Pedicularis arctoeuropaea, commonly known as the European monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble the shape of a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat."
