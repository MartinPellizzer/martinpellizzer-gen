    "intro": "Polystichum integrilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into broad, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
