    "intro": "Phoradendron crenulatum, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for various insects and birds. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees."
