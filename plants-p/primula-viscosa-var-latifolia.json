    "intro": "Primula viscosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sticky primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are broad and hairy, with a distinctive sticky texture due to the presence of glandular trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and attractive addition to horticultural collections."
