It features small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or reddish in color, which are followed by small, round berries. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it an ideal houseplant for indoor cultivation. Its slow growth rate and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts alike."
