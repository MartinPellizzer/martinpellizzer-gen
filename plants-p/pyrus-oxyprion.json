    "intro": "Pyrus oxyprion, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar to pears but are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
