    "intro": "Polypodium leptostomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
