    "intro": "Plantago lacustris, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Plantago lacustris is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating wounds and respiratory ailments."
