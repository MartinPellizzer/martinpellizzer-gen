    "intro": "Plantago montisdicksonii, commonly known as the Montis Dickson's plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
