    "intro": "Pistorinia hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish pistorinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Pistorinia hispanica is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
