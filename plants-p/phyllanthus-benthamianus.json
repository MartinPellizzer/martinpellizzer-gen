    "intro": "Phyllanthus benthamianus, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. The botanical features of Phyllanthus benthamianus make it a valuable species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
