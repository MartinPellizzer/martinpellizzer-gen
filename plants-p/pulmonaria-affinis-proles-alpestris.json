    "intro": "Pulmonaria affinis proles alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine Lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often spotted with silver or purple markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in mountain meadows. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
