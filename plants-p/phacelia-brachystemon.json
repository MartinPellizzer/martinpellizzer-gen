    "intro": "Phacelia brachystemon, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Phacelia brachystemon is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
