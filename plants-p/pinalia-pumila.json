    "intro": "Pinalia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a small, spiny cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a compact, globular shape. The plant features dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Pinalia pumila is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
