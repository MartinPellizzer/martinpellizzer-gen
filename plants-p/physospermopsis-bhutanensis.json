    "intro": "Physospermopsis bhutanensis, commonly known as the Bhutanese physosperm, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of biodiversity in the Eastern Himalayas."
