    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. juncoides, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
