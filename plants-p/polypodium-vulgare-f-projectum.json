    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. projectum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading growth habit. It features finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, brownish hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
