It is characterized by its impressive size, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree in warmer regions."
