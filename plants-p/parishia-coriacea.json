    "intro": "Parishia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf parishia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a woody stem and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a thick, leathery cuticle, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late summer to early fall. Parishia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments."
