    "intro": "Pedicularis cheilanthifolia var. isochila, commonly known as the \"Lion's Head\" or \"Scorpion's Tail,\" is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant is characterized by its vivid red, spurred flowers that resemble a scorpion's tail, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
