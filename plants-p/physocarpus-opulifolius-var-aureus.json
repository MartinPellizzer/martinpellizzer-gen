It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that appear in panicles during late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its foliage turns a striking orange-red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
