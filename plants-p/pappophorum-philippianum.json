    "intro": "Pappophorum philippianum, commonly known as the Philippine grass or Philippine pappophore, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bract-like structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
