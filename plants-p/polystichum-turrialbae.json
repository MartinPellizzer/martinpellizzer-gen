    "intro": "Polystichum turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba holly fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
