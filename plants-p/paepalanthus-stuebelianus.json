It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems that resemble a candelabra, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
