    "intro": "Phaca glabra, commonly known as the smooth phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are smooth and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
