    "intro": "Pluchea ovalis, commonly known as the ovalleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause stress to its host plants if left unchecked."
