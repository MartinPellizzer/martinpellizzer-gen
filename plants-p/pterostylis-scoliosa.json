    "intro": "Pterostylis scoliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a distinctive greenish-brown flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are often concealed among the foliage, making them difficult to spot. Pterostylis scoliosa is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake."
