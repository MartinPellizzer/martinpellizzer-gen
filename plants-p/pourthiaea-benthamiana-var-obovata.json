    "intro": "Pourthiaea benthamiana var. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed benthamia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its obovate leaves, which are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
