    "intro": "Physostemon stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf physostemon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
