    "intro": "Poa ochotensis subsp. stepposa, commonly known as the Siberian steppe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly in Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in open, low-nutrient soils of alpine and steppe environments, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats."
