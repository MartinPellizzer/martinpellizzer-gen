It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and climate change impacts. Prasophyllum dixonii plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
