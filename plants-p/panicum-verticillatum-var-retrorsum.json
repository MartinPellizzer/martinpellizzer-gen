    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. retrorsum, commonly known as curly millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright green, narrow leaves that are often rolled or curled at the edges. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like seed heads that are typically golden or brown in color, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in native plant gardens and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense ground cover make it a valuable plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
