    "intro": "Peperomia arechavaletae var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the humid forests of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly wavy or serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale green, typical of the peperomia genus. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
