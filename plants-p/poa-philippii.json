    "intro": "Poa philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Poa philippii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
