    "intro": "Podocarpus nagi var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged spirally along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate shade."
