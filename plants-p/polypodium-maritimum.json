    "intro": "Polypodium maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a fern native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it adapts to salty and windy conditions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fronds that are typically gray-green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
