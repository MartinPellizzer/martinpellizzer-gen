    "intro": "Pitcairnia wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's pitcairnia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
