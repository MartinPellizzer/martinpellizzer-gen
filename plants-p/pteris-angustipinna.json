    "intro": "Pteris angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rock. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
