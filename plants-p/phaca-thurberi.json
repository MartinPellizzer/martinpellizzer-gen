    "intro": "Phaca thurberi, commonly known as Thurber's phaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
