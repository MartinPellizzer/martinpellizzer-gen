It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Polybotrya trilobata make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
