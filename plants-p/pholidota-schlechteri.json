    "intro": "Pholidota schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's pholidota, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Africa. This shrub is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
