    "intro": "Polystichum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant's rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients, making it adaptable to various soil conditions. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
