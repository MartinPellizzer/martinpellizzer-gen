    "intro": "Poa villosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of blue-gray flowers, which are distinctive in appearance. Poa villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
