    "intro": "Polygala laticarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Polygala laticarpa is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
