    "intro": "Pinalia jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's pinyon, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within tropical evergreen forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several small, edible seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinalia jerdoniana is considered a vulnerable species."
