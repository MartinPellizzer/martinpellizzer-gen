    "intro": "Polypodium pallens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It is native to various regions across the Americas, including Mexico and parts of the United States. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
