    "intro": "Pilea rotundata var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a compact, low-growing houseplant with a dense rosette of thick, velvety, dark green leaves. Its foliage is characterized by a smooth, waxy texture and a deep, almost blackish-green hue, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in the spring, followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
