    "intro": "Prosopis reptans, commonly known as the creeping mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Prosopis reptans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
