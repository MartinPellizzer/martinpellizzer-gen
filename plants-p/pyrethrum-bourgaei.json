It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are the source of its natural insecticidal properties. Pyrethrum bourgaei thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable."
