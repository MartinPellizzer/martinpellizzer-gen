    "intro": "Pilosella lasiothrix, commonly known as the woolly pappus plant, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called capitula. It is native to Europe and western Asia and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Pilosella lasiothrix is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
