    "intro": "Phaca brachyptera, commonly known as the short-winged phaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
