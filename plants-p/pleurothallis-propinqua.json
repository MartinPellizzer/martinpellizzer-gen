    "intro": "Pleurothallis propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. Pleurothallis propinqua is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
