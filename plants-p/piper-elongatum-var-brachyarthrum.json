    "intro": "Piper elongatum var. brachyarthrum, commonly known as the short-stemmed pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses. The varietal name \"brachyarthrum\" refers to its shorter stem structure compared to the typical form of Piper elongatum."
