    "intro": "Polystichum macrochlaenum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features large, dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant's robust rhizome system allows it to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
