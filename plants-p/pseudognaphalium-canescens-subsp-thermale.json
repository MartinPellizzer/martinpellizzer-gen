    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium canescens subsp. thermale, commonly known as the thermophilic everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
