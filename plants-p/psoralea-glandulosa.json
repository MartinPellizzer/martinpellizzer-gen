    "intro": "Psoralea glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits. Psoralea glandulosa is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
