It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
