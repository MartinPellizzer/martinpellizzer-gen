    "intro": "Puya compacta, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky flower spikes that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Puya compacta is adapted to cool, sunny environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain."
