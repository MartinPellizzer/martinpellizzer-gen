    "intro": "Pterostylis tryphera, commonly known as the red-tongued orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streamlines. Its flowering period occurs during the autumn season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in its native habitat."
