    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare f. prionodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually narrower and more elongated compared to the typical form, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
