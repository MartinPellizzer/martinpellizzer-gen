    "intro": "Pastinaca sativa subsp. urens, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root is often used in traditional medicine and has a distinct, peppery flavor. However, it can cause photodermatitis in humans when its sap comes into contact with skin and is then exposed to sunlight."
