These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals. Peltaea species typically have palmately compound leaves, which are divided into several leaflets radiating from a central point. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
