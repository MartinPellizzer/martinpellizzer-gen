It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance plant for native gardens."
