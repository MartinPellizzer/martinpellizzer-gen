    "intro": "Prosopis casadensis, commonly known as the Argentine mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Prosopis casadensis plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous communities for various purposes."
