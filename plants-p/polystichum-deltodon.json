    "intro": "Polystichum deltodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum deltodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
