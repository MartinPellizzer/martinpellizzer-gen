    "intro": "Pulassarium gracile, commonly known as the slender pulassarium, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant features a slender, erect stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with variegation. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Pulassarium gracile is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize it in muddy substrates."
