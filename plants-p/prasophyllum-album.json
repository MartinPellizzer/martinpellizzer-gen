    "intro": "Prasophyllum album, commonly known as the white leek orchid, is a striking plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of white, leek-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it is often found in open heathlands or on the edges of forests. Prasophyllum album is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
