    "intro": "Parathelypteris chingii, commonly known as the Ching's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Parathelypteris chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
