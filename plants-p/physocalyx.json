    "intro": "Physocalyx, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the calyx. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant can grow as a shrub or small tree. Physocalyx species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
