    "intro": "Pollalesta klugii, commonly known as the Klug's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pollalesta klugii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
