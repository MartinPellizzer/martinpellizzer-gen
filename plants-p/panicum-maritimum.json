    "intro": "Panicum maritimum, commonly known as salt grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in salty, well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small animals and insects. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
