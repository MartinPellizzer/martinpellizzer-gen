It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a spiral along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several countries."
