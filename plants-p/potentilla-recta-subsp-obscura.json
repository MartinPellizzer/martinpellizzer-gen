It is characterized by its dark, often purplish stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
