    "intro": "Platanthera glaberrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions."
