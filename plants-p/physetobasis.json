    "intro": "Physetobasis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing clusters of showy bracts that attract pollinators. Physetobasis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
