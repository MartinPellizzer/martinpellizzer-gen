    "intro": "Polyspora oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf polypody, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It features slender, arching fronds with a lanceolate shape, often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
