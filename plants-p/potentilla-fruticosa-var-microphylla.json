    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. microphylla, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in groups of five, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
