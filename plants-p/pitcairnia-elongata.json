    "intro": "Pitcairnia elongata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant forms a dense rosette structure, with the leaves tightly clustered at the base to create a water-holding reservoir. Its striking inflorescence consists of vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Pitcairnia elongata thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
