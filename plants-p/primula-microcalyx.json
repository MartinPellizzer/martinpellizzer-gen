    "intro": "Primula microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blossoms that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct throat coloration. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
