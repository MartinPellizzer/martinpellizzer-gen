It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
