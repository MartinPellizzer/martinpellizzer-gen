    "intro": "Pyrostria buxifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pyrostria, is a unique evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically a striking silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Pyrostria buxifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and attractive appearance."
