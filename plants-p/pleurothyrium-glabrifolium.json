It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
