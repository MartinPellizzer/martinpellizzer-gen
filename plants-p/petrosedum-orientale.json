    "intro": "Petrosedum orientale, commonly known as the oriental stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to regions of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-maintain plant for gardeners."
