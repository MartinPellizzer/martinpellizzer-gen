    "intro": "Psychotria globicephala, commonly known as the \"globeflower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers clustered together. It typically grows as an epiphytic plant, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. Psychotria globicephala is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
