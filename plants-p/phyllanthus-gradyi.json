    "intro": "Phyllanthus gradyi, commonly known as the African date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food."
