    "intro": "Pseudostifftia, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus of the Andes,\" is a rare and unique plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Pseudostifftia is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
