    "intro": "Phyllostegia triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stiltroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive triangular shape that gives the species its scientific name. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks."
