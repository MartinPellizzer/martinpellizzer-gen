    "intro": "Piptocarpha cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuesta de Tijuana or Tijuana dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and dry landscapes, thriving in harsh, sun-exposed environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
