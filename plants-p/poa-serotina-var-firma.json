    "intro": "Poa serotina var. firma, commonly known as the firm tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
