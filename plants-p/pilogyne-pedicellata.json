    "intro": "Pilogyne pedicellata, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast, often in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
