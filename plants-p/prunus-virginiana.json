    "intro": "Prunus virginiana, commonly known as the wild cherry or chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 12 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are considered toxic to humans due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
