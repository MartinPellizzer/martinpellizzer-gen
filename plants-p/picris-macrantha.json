    "intro": "Picris macrantha, commonly known as the tall yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
