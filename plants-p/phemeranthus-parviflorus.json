    "intro": "Phemeranthus parviflorus, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a unique plant species native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is notable for its brief blooming period, with flowers appearing for only a few days before they wither. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its short flowering duration and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
