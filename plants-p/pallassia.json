    "intro": "Pallassia, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plants are characterized by their distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or white, and they rely on water for propagation and nutrient absorption. Pallassia species play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
