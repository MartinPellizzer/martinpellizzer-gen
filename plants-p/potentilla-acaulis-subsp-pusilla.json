    "intro": "Potentilla acaulis subsp. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its compact growth form and resilience make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
