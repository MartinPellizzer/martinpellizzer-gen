    "intro": "Periglossum mckenii, commonly known as the McKenzie's periglossum, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
