    "intro": "Plectocomiopsis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Plectocomiopsis dubia is considered a conservation concern."
