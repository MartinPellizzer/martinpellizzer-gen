    "intro": "Polypodium macropterum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name."
