It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Poa despiciens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
