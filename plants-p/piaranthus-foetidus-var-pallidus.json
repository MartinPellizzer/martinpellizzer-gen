It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Despite its common name, it is not widely cultivated and remains a relatively obscure species in botanical studies."
