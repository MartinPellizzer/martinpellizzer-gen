    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. eriostyla, commonly known as the hairy crabapple, is a variant of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is often found in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible, sour fruits that are sometimes used in jams or wines. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a key botanical feature that sets it apart from other apple varieties."
