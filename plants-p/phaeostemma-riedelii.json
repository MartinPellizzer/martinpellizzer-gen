    "intro": "Phaeostemma riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's phaeostema, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Phaeostemma riedelii is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
