    "intro": "Polypodium splendidum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium splendidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
