    "intro": "Physostegia aboriginorum, commonly known as the native whorled pogonia, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with whorled leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
