    "intro": "Pycnanthus microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf pycnanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
