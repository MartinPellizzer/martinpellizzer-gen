    "intro": "Pellaea nivea f. tenera, commonly known as the soft fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-white fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft texture. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
