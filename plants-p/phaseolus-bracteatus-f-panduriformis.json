    "intro": "Phaseolus bracteatus f. panduriformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf runner bean, is a variant of the common runner bean characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to Central and South America and is cultivated for its edible beans, which are typically harvested when young and tender. The flowers are usually white or pale purple, and they are followed by pods that mature into dark brown or black beans. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach significant heights, making it suitable for trellises or supports in gardens."
