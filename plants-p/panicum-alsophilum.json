    "intro": "Panicum alsophilum, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soils. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Silver hairgrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
