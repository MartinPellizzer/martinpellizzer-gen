    "intro": "Picea farreri, commonly known as the Farre's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea farreri thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
