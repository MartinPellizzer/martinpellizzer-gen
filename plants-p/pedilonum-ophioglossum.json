    "intro": "Pedilonum ophioglossum, commonly known as the lesser calamite, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant with a unique botanical structure. It possesses a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, spirally coiled frond that unfurls into a broad, lance-shaped leaf. The plant has a distinctive reproductive system, featuring a spore-bearing sorus located on the underside of its frond. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
