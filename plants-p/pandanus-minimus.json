    "intro": "Pandanus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are sometimes used for thatching. Pandanus minimus thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade."
