It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
