    "intro": "Payena microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved payena, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. Payena microphylla is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
