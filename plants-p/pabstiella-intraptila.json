    "intro": "Pabstiella intraptila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
