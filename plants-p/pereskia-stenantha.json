    "intro": "Pereskia stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cactus, is a unique species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. The leaves are narrow and often persist for a long time, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its structure. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not closely related to true cacti and belongs to the Cactaceae family."
