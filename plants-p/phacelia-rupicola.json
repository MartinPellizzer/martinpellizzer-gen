    "intro": "Phacelia rupicola, commonly known as the rock phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Phacelia rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in native landscapes."
