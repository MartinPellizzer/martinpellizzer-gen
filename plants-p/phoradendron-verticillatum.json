    "intro": "Phoradendron verticillatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics and subtropics. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees. This plant plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals, while also influencing the health of its host trees."
