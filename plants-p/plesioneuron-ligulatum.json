    "intro": "Plesioneuron ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
