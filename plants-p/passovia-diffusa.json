    "intro": "Passovia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading passovia, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in partial shade. Passovia diffusa is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects."
