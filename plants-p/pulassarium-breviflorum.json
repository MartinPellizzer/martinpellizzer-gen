    "intro": "Pulassarium breviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf-flowered pulassarium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short stature, often reaching only a few inches in height. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually white or pale yellow, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
