    "intro": "Psychotria hazenii, commonly known as the \"Hazen's Psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Psychotria hazenii is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
