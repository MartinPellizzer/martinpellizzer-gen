    "intro": "Psilocarya rufa, commonly known as the red-spored liberty cap, is a species of psychoactive mushroom native to the western United States. It belongs to the genus Psilocybe and is characterized by its conical cap that turns reddish-brown with age. The cap is typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale gray mycelium, and the stem is slender with a bulbous base. It contains psilocybin and psilocin, which are responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. This species is often found in grassy areas and is a popular subject in both mycological research and recreational use."
