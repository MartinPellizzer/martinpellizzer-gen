    "intro": "Phlomis sewerzowii, commonly known as the Armenian giant hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
