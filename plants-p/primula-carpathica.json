    "intro": "Primula carpathica, commonly known as the Carpathian primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, woolly texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Primula carpathica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming flowers."
