    "intro": "Puya ponderosa, commonly known as the Andean torch or the giant torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a thick, fibrous stem that stores water. Its flowers, which appear at the top of the plant, are typically red or orange and bloom in late summer. Puya ponderosa is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is known for its long lifespan, sometimes living over 100 years."
