    "intro": "Psychotria mauiensis var. subcordata, commonly known as the Maui Psychotria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive subcordate base. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, often found in the wetter regions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
