    "intro": "Polypodium multisorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically divided into segments, with the uppermost leaves being the most prominent and often used for propagation."
