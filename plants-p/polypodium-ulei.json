    "intro": "Polypodium ulei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polypodium ulei is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
