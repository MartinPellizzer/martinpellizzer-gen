    "intro": "Pleurothallis dewildei, commonly known as the Dewilde's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for miniature orchid collections."
