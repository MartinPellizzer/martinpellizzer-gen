    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. proxima, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces small, red berries that persist into the winter. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
