    "intro": "Pyrus madoniensis, commonly known as the Madon's pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically edible but not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
