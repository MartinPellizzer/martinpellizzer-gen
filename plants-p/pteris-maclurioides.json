    "intro": "Pteris maclurioides, commonly known as the Maclurian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Pteris maclurioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
