    "intro": "Pinus uncinata subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded knobcone pine, is a subspecies of the knobcone pine native to the Pyrenees and southern France. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The tree grows in mountainous regions, often at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its cones remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds, a feature that aids in its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
