It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage. The plant forms dense tufts or cushions, adapting to harsh, cold environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers. This variety is particularly suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy pioneer species in disturbed or barren landscapes."
