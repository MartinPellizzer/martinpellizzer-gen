    "intro": "Phoradendron saxicola, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the family Loranthaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or branches of trees. This species is native to the Americas and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, yellowish flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The plant's unique adaptation to parasitism allows it to thrive in environments where other plants may struggle to survive."
