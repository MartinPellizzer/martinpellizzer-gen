    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. santamariae, commonly known as the Santa Maria Phillyrea, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive visual appeal. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red-brown berries. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
