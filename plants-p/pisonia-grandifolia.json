    "intro": "Pisonia grandifolia, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions. The plant produces showy, pink or red bract-like flowers that are often mistaken for petals, which attract birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pisonia grandifolia is also known for its strong, aromatic scent, which enhances its appeal to pollinators."
