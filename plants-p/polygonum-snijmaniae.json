    "intro": "Polygonum snijmaniae, commonly known as the Snijman's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
