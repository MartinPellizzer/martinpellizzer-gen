It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikes of purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a fountain-like appearance due to its branching pattern. Pennisetum frutescens is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
