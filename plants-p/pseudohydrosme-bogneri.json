    "intro": "Pseudohydrosme bogneri, commonly known as the Bogner's pseudohydrosme, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
