    "intro": "Pteris intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive margin that often exhibits a narrow, overlapping structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance."
