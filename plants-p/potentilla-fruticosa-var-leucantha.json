    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. leucantha, commonly known as white cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
