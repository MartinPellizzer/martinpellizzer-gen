    "intro": "Pinus tamrac, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. Pinus tamrac is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its graceful form and year-round foliage."
