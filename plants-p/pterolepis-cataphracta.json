    "intro": "Pterolepis cataphracta, commonly known as the African rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Pterolepis cataphracta is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low rainfall."
