    "intro": "Psychotria tomentosa, commonly known as the \"Hemp Ague\" or \"Coca of the Andes,\" is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritual purposes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
