    "intro": "Pedicularis orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
