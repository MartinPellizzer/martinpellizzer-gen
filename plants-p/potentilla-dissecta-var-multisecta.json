    "intro": "Potentilla dissecta var. multisecta, commonly known as the finely dissected cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
