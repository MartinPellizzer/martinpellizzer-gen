    "intro": "Photinia nussia, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the fall, providing striking autumn color. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Photinia nussia is relatively low maintenance and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
