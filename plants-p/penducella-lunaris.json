    "intro": "Penducella lunaris, commonly known as the moonflower penducel, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to its environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Penducella lunaris is considered a vulnerable species."
