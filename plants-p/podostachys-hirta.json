    "intro": "Podostachys hirta, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces small, nutlet-like fruits. Podostachys hirta plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
