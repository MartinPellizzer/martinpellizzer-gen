    "intro": "Pandanus thomissophyllus, commonly known as the New Caledonian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers, which are followed by spiny, fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
