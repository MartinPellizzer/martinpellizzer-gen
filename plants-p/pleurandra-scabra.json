    "intro": "Pleurandra scabra, commonly known as the rough pleurandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its smooth, arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Pleurandra scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
