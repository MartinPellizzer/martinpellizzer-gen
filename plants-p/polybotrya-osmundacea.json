    "intro": "Polybotrya osmundacea, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like formations on the fronds."
