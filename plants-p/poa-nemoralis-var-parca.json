    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. parca, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites. This variety is often found in association with other woodland flora, playing a role in soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
