It is characterized by its elongated, oblong seeds that are typically pale green to yellow in color. This plant is native to South America, specifically regions of Peru and Bolivia, where it thrives in warm, tropical climates. The Laudun bean is often cultivated for its unique flavor and nutritional value, though it remains relatively rare in global agriculture. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a climbing habit, typical of many Phaseolus species."
