It is characterized by its woody stems, small leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically curled or twisted, giving it its common name. Purgosea pertusula is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
