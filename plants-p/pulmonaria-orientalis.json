    "intro": "Pulmonaria orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of velvety, spotted leaves that range from silver to green, with a distinctive blue or purple bloom of spurred flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name derives from the leaf patterns that resemble lung tissue, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Pulmonaria orientalis is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
