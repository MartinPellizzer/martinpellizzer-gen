    "intro": "Phanerodiscus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's disc lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its large, showy, disc-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with prominent yellow stamens. The plant belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is known for its unique floral structure, which resembles a flat disc rather than the typical tubular shape of many lilies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
