    "intro": "Psychotria erythrophylla, commonly known as the red-veined psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking red veins on its dark green leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Psychotria erythrophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
