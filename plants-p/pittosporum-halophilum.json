    "intro": "Pittosporum halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush pittosporum, is a shrub native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Pittosporum halophilum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
