It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. This variety is particularly noted for its distinctive elongated flower clusters that resemble a tail, giving it its common name.
