    "intro": "Poa pallens, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive, frost-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Poa pallens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
