    "intro": "Picris taraxaci, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important early successional plant."
