    "intro": "Plethiandra tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly plethiandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a soft, velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Plethiandra tomentosa is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
