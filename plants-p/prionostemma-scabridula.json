    "intro": "Prionostemma scabridula, commonly known as the rough prionostemma, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features woody stems covered in rough, scaly bark, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Prionostemma scabridula is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
