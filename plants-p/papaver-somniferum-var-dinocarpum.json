    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. dinocarpum, commonly known as the Persian poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive, large, cup-shaped flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran and Afghanistan. The plant produces dark red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, palmately lobed leaves, and a capsule fruit that contains the latex-rich seeds. This variety is of interest for its ornamental value and historical significance in the production of opium and other alkaloids."
