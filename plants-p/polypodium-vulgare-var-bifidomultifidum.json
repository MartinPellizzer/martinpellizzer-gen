    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. bifidomultifidum, commonly known as the bifid and multifid maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bifid or multifid shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery texture that contributes to its ornamental value."
