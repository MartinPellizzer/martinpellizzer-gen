    "intro": "Porpax semiconnata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed porpax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, branched stems and finely divided, pinnately compound leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Porpax semiconnata is often found in rocky soils and open woodland areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
