    "intro": "Poa gregalis, commonly known as the mountain grass or tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a compact, often nodding cluster. Poa gregalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
