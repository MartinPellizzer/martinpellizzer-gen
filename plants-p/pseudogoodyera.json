    "intro": "Pseudogoodyera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Unlike many orchids, it is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique adaptations allow it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pseudogoodyera is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
