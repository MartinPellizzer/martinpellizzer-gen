    "intro": "Podosperma pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf Persian ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard, pale seeds. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
