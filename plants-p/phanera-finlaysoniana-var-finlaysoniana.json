It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in limestone soils. It plays a significant role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
