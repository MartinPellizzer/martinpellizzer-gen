    "intro": "Platystele repens, commonly known as the creeping platystele, is a rare and delicate member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and bloom in clusters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Platystele repens is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
