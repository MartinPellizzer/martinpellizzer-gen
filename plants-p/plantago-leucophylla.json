    "intro": "Plantago leucophylla, commonly known as the whiteleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, white appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
