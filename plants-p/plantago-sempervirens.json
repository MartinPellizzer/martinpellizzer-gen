It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
