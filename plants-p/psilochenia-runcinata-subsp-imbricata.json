    "intro": "Psilochenia runcinata subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed psilochenia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often complex inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and umbellate flowers, which are typically arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
