    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese bracken, is a variant of the common bracken that is native to East Asia. It is a fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
