    "intro": "Polypodium poeppigianum, commonly known as the Poeppig's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
