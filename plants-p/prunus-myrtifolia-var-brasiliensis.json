    "intro": "Prunus myrtifolia var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, edible fruits resembling cherries. Its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation outside its native range. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
