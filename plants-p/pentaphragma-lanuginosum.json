    "intro": "Pentaphragma lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or nearly so. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
