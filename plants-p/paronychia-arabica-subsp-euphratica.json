    "intro": "Paronychia arabica subsp. euphratica, commonly known as the Euphrates sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny, woody stems that provide structural support in harsh environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
