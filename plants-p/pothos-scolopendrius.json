    "intro": "Pothos scolopendrius, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a trailing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and is highly tolerant of neglect, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to climb or trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets, shelves, or as a ground cover in gardens."
