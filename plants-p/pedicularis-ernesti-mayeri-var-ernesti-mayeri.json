    "intro": "Pedicularis ernesti-mayeri var. ernesti-mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense spikes. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
