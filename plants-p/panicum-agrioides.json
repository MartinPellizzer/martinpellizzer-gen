    "intro": "Panicum agrioides, commonly known as agrimony panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear panicles of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence is often erect and branched. Agrimony panicgrass plays a role in stabilizing soils in wetland environments and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
