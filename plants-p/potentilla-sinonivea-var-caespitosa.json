    "intro": "Potentilla sinonivea var. caespitosa, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost-resistant nature and ability to form dense mats."
