    "intro": "Pomatocalpa bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
