    "intro": "Pachystima krautteri, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Pachystima krautteri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
