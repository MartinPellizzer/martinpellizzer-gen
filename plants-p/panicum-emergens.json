    "intro": "Panicum emergens, commonly known as the upland panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a terminal panicle, which is a loose, branched cluster of spikelets. Panicum emergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland and riparian habitats."
