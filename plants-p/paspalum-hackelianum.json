    "intro": "Paspalum hackelianum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it valuable for erosion control. It is also a host plant for several Lepidoptera species, contributing to local biodiversity."
