    "intro": "Puccinellia walkeri, commonly known as the Walker's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil. Puccinellia walkeri is also used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and low maintenance requirements."
