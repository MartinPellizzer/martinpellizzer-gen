    "intro": "Populus villosa, commonly known as the silky poplar or cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in fluffy, cotton-like structures that aid in wind dispersal. Populus villosa is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
