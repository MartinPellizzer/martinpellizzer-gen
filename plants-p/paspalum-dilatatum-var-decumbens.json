    "intro": "Paspalum dilatatum var. decumbens, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
