    "intro": "Pinus anemophila, commonly known as the creeping foxtail pine, is a species of pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, a key adaptation for its habitat. Its needles are typically blue-green in color and remain on the plant for several years. This species is often found in high-altitude regions and is notable for its resilience in harsh, dry conditions."
