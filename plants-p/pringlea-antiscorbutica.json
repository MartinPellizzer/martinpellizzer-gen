    "intro": "Pringlea antiscorbutica, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, greenish-white leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that help retain moisture and withstand freezing temperatures. Pringlea antiscorbutica is a hardy species often found in alpine and subantarctic regions."
