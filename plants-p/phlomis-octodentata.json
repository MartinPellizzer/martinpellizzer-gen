    "intro": "Phlomis octodentata, commonly known as the eight-toothed mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, gray-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish to orange-red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Phlomis octodentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
