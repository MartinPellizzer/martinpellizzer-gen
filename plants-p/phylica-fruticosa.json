    "intro": "Phylica fruticosa, commonly known as the silver bush, is a flowering shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Phylica fruticosa also provides habitat and food for various insects and birds."
