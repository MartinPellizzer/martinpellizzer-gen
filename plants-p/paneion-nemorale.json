It features delicate, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name reflects its association with forested habitats, with \"nemorale\" derived from the Latin word for forest."
