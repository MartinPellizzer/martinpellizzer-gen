    "intro": "Poa lachenensis, commonly known as the Lachen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
