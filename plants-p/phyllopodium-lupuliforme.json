    "intro": "Phyllopodium lupuliforme, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the delicate structure of a fern, with each leaflet appearing as a small, cup-shaped structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The golden cup fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural displays due to its unique appearance."
