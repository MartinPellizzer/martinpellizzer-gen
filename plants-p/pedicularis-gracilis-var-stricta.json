    "intro": "Pedicularis gracilis var. stricta, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
