    "intro": "Pteridium revolutum var. muricatulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often rough-textured fronds. The leaves are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
