    "intro": "Piptomeris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Piptomeris species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they thrive in salty, well-drained environments. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance. The genus includes several species, with Piptomeris laevis and Piptomeris scaber being among the most commonly recognized."
