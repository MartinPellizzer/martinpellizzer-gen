    "intro": "Primula nivalis eximia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species, often adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions."
