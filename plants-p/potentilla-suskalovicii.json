    "intro": "Potentilla suskalovicii, commonly known as the Karakachan Potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Bulgaria and the European part of Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
