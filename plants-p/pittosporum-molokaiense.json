    "intro": "Pittosporum molokaiense, commonly known as Molokai Pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically dark red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
