    "intro": "Phlegmariurus cruentus var. illimitatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are typically reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
