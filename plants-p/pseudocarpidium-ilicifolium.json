    "intro": "Pseudocarpidium ilicifolium, commonly known as the holly-leaved pseudocarpidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that resembles holly leaves, with dark green upper surfaces and lighter undersides. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Pseudocarpidium ilicifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for humid, tropical climates."
