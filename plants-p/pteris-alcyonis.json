    "intro": "Pteris alcyonis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
