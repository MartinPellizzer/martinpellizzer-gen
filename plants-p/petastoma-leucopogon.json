    "intro": "Petastoma leucopogon, commonly known as the white-tongued lily, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Petastoma leucopogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
