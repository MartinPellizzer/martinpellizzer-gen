It features a dense, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, erect flowering stem that bears a single spike of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are typically fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
