    "intro": "Poa imbecilla var. matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, bluish-green coloration. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
