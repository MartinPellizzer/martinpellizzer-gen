    "intro": "Pterostylis, commonly known as the grasshopper orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often insect-like appearance. Many species have small, green or brown flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in their pollination by attracting specific insects. The genus includes over 100 species, most of which are terrestrial and grow in a variety of habitats. Pterostylis plants typically have a single stem with a single flower, and their leaves are often narrow and grass-like."
