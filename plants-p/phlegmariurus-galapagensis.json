    "intro": "Phlegmariurus galapagensis, commonly known as the Galapagos haircap moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a mat-forming, leafy plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the humid microclimates of the Galapagos Islands. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with small, overlapping leaves that are covered in a layer of translucent, waxy cells, aiding in water retention. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and are often clustered near the tips of the leaves. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitat."
