    "intro": "Pyrus gerecseensis, commonly known as the Gerecse pear, is a rare and endemic species native to Hungary. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
