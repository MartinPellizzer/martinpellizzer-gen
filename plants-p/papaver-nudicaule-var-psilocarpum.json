    "intro": "Papaver nudicaule var. psilocarpum, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle violet or blue tinge. The plant produces a unique, lantern-like seed pod that turns red as it matures, containing numerous small, dark seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
