    "intro": "Paepalanthus cacuminis, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, often in regions with cool, temperate climates. It produces small, spherical fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
