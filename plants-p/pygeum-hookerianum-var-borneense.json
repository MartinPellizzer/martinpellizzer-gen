    "intro": "Pygeum hookerianum var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean African cherry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is often found in secondary growth and along riverbanks, thriving in humid, tropical conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
