    "intro": "Piper canescens, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a flowering plant in the Piperaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. The plant is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce white pepper, a spice similar to black pepper but with a milder flavor."
