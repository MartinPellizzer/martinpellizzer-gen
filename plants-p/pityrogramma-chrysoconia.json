    "intro": "Pityrogramma chrysoconia, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The golden hue of its hairs gives the plant its common name and contributes to its ornamental value."
