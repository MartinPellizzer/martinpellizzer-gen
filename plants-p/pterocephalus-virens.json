    "intro": "Pterocephalus virens, commonly known as the green-headed vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Pterocephalus virens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in some regions for forage or ornamental purposes."
