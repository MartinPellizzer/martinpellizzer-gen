    "intro": "Panicum album, commonly known as white panicgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, white to grayish flowers that bloom in dense, fluffy panicles. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
