    "intro": "Phleum parviceps, commonly known as slender timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Phleum parviceps is valued for its role in ecological systems and as a forage crop for livestock."
