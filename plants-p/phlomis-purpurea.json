    "intro": "Phlomis purpurea, commonly known as purple mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, purple or pinkish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating. Phlomis purpurea is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
