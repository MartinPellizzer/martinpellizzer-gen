    "intro": "Pterotheca aspera, commonly known as the rough pterotheca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the daisy family. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
