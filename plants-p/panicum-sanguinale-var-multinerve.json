    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. multinerve, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive reddish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, red or brown bracts, which are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
