    "intro": "Polystichum longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies over time. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
