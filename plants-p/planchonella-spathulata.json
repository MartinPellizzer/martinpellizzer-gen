    "intro": "Planchonella spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by edible, spiny fruits resembling small coconuts. Its robust root system makes it adaptable to various soil types, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
