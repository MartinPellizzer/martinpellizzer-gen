    "intro": "Peganum harmala var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Syrian rue, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. It contains various alkaloids, including harmine and harmaline, which have been studied for their potential medicinal and psychoactive properties. Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
