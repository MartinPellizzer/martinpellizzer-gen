    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. neglectum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in cultivated environments."
