    "intro": "Potentilla depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower or lesser potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
