    "intro": "Pteris plumieri, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pteris plumieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
