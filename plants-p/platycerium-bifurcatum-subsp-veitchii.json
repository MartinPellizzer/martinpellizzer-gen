    "intro": "Platycerium bifurcatum subsp. veitchii, commonly known as the veitch's staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the plant's rhizomes. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
