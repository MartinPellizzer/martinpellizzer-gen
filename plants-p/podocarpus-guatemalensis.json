It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture and forestry."
