    "intro": "Pteris famatinensis, commonly known as the Famatin fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Pteris famatinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
