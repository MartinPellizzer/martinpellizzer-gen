    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. tenella, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming habit with small, rounded, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
