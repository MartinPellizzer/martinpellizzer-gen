It is a mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant's leaves are small, ovate, and densely arranged, with a distinctive spiny texture on the upper surface. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.
