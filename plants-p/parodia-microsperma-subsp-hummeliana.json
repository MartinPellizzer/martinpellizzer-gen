    "intro": "Parodia microsperma subsp. hummeliana, commonly known as the Hummel's parodia, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, stout stem with dense, white to pale green areoles covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a slow-growing species that requires minimal water and bright light to thrive."
