    "intro": "Paratropia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved paratropia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Paratropia latifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along riverbanks."
