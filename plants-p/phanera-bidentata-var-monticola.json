    "intro": "Phanera bidentata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain phanera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with two distinct teeth on each margin. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in secondary forests or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
