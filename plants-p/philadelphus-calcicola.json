    "intro": "Philadelphus calcicola, commonly known as the rock spirea, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, with a silvery or grayish underside. Philadelphus calcicola is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
