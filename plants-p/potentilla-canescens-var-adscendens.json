    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
