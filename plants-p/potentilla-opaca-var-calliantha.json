It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
