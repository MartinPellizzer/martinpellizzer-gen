    "intro": "Peucedanum gallicum var. majus, commonly known as the greater cow parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which releases small, hairy seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
