    "intro": "Phragmanthera usuiensis subsp. sigensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada phragmanthera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure, which contribute to its ecological niche in rocky, well-drained soils. It typically blooms in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
