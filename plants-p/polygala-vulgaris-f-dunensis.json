    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris f. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland milk-vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
