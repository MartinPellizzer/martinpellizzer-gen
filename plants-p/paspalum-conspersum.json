    "intro": "Paspalum conspersum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Paspalum conspersum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in various environmental conditions."
