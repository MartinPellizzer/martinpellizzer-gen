It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Paysonia stonensis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
