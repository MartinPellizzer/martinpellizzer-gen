    "intro": "Parodia sanagasta var. saltensis, commonly known as the Saltensis Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to northern Argentina. It features a ribbed, cylindrical body with a smooth, pale green to blue-gray surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
