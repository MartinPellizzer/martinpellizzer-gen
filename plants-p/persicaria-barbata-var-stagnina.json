    "intro": "Persicaria barbata var. stagnina, commonly known as the slender smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soil and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth and shorter stature compared to the typical form of Persicaria barbata."
