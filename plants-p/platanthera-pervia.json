    "intro": "Platanthera pervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near ponds, streams, or marshes. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Platanthera pervia is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
