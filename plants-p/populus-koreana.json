    "intro": "Populus koreana, commonly known as the Korean poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Populus koreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
