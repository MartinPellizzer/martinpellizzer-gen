    "intro": "Panmorphia steinbuchiae, commonly known as the Steinbuch's panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its striking, multicolored bracts that resemble a flower cluster, though it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
