    "intro": "Pleopeltis gyroflexa, commonly known as the spiral pleurothallis, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features intricate, pleated leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pleopeltis gyroflexa is considered a delicate and endangered species."
