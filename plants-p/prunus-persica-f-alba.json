    "intro": "Prunus persica f. alba, commonly known as the white peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its pale pink to white flowers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often grown for its showy blooms rather than its fruit. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. The flowers appear in early spring, preceding the development of fruit, and are an important feature in horticultural landscapes."
