    "intro": "Pinus armandi subsp. dabeshanensis, commonly known as the Dabeshan pine, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
