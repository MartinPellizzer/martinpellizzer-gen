    "intro": "Plantago intermedia, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Eurasia and North America. It features upright, ribbed stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
