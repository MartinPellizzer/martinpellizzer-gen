    "intro": "Pleocnemia presliana, commonly known as the Presliana fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, clustered growth form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
