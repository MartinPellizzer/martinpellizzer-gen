    "intro": "Polystichum puteicola, commonly known as the Puteicola fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystichum puteicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
