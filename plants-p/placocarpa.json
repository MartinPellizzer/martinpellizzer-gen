It is native to Australia and features woody shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Placocarpa species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture and for their ornamental value."
