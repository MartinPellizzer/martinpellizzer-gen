    "intro": "Pneumatopteris glabra, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its leaves are simple, with a smooth surface and a distinct, slender rachis. Pneumatopteris glabra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
