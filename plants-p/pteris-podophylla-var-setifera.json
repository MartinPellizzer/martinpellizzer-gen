    "intro": "Pteris podophylla var. setifera, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it in wet soils or water. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
