    "intro": "Picea balsamea var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more sharply pointed than those of the parent species. The cones are typically reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental horticulture and is also valued for its role in the timber industry."
