It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or bronze on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Polyscias fulva is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
