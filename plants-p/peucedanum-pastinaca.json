It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal remedies. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
