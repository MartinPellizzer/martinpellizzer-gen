It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip and a smooth, glossy surface. The fruit is a small, sweet drupe that ripens in summer, and the plant is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes. It plays an important role in traditional Japanese culture and is a symbol of renewal and beauty."
