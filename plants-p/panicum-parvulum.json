    "intro": "Panicum parvulum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and is characterized by its blue-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed areas. Panicum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
