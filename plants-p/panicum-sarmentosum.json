    "intro": "Panicum sarmentosum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
