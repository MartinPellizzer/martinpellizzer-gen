    "intro": "Polypodium lapathifolium, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb moisture efficiently. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
