    "intro": "Poa alberti var. biflora, commonly known as the Albert's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
