    "intro": "Peponium urticoides, commonly known as the stinging nettle vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, often stinging leaves and small yellow flowers that grow in clusters. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are often trailing or climbing, and it produces fruits that are capsules containing seeds. Peponium urticoides is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its irritant properties require caution during handling."
