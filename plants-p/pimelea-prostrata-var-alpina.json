    "intro": "Pimelea prostrata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine mistflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that form a mat-like structure, helping it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in cold, windy environments. This variety is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in open heathlands or on rocky outcrops."
