    "intro": "Platycyparis funebris, commonly known as the Italian cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar shape and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, giving it a smooth, almost bark-like appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous plants. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes around the world."
