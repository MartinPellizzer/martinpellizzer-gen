    "intro": "Panisea panchaseensis, commonly known as the Panchase mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas, thriving in the cool and humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
