    "intro": "Polypodium krameri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant typically has dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients."
