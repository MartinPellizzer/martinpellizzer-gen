    "intro": "Panicum chevalieri, commonly known as the dwarf panic grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
