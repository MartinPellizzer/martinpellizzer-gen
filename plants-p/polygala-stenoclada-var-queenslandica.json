    "intro": "Polygala stenoclada var. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland flat-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are usually pale green or yellow, are adapted for pollination by insects."
