It features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant's nectar is a valuable food source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
