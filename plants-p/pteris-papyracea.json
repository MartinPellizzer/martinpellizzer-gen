    "intro": "Pteris papyracea, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in traditional crafts due to their papery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
