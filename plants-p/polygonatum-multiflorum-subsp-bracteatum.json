It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
