    "intro": "Paspalidium subtransiens, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses."
