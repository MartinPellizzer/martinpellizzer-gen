    "intro": "Pilosella officinarum subsp. trichosoma, commonly known as the hairy mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
