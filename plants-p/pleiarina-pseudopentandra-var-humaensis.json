    "intro": "Pleiarina pseudopentandra var. humaensis, commonly known as the Humaensis pleiarina, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and emit a subtle fragrance when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
