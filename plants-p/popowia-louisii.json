    "intro": "Popowia louisii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, yellow flowers resembling those of the dandelion. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Popowia louisii is adapted to poor soils and can survive in extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
