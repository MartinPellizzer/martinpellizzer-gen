    "intro": "Pentopetia pinnata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by elongated, woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds. Pentopetia pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
