    "intro": "Parkia insignis, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, creating a vibrant display during the flowering season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
