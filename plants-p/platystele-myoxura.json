    "intro": "Platystele myoxura, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is crucial for its survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Platystele myoxura is considered critically endangered."
