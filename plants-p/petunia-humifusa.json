    "intro": "Petunia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping petunia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, typically blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are rich in nectar, attracting various pollinators. Petunia humifusa is well-suited for ground cover in gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
