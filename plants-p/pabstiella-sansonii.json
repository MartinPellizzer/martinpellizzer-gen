    "intro": "Pabstiella sansonii, commonly known as the Sansevieria, is a hardy, evergreen flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are usually variegated with green, yellow, and white patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Pabstiella sansonii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
