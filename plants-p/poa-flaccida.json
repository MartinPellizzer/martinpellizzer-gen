    "intro": "Poa flaccida, commonly known as the limp bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa flaccida is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
