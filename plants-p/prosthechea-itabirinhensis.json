    "intro": "Prosthechea itabirinhensis, commonly known as the Itabirinhense orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, pendulous inflorescences. The plant typically grows on trees in humid tropical forests, relying on its roots for attachment rather than soil. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often displaying a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
