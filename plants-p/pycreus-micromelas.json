    "intro": "Pycreus micromelas, commonly known as the small-flowered pycreus, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or woodland environments. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
