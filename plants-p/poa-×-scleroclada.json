    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 scleroclada, commonly known as the rigid bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its dense growth habit makes it a desirable ground cover in certain ecological and horticultural settings."
