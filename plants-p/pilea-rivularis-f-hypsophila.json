    "intro": "Pilea rivularis f. hypsophila, commonly known as the highland pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, which are typically followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
