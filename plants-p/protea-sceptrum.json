    "intro": "Protea sceptrum, commonly known as the king protea, is a striking member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous individual flowers arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dense, leathery leaves that are often gray-green in color. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red, and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects. Protea sceptrum is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
