    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. procumbens, commonly known as prostrate knotgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
