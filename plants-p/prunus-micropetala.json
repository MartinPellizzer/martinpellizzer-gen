    "intro": "Prunus micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small-petioled cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are often used in jams and desserts. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Prunus micropetala is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
