    "intro": "Penstemon hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular flowers, often in shades of pink, purple, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Penstemon hirsutus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer season."
