    "intro": "Pterostylis hians, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a single, pale green or white flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich labellum. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pterostylis hians is considered a vulnerable species."
