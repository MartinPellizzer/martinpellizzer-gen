    "intro": "Pinus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its silvery-blue needle-like leaves, which are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Pinus sinensis is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
