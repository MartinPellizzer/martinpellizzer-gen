    "intro": "Poa tristis subsp. bryophila, commonly known as the mossy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which often resembles moss. This subspecies typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures include spikelets with small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant's ability to form dense mats makes it an important component of certain ecological systems."
