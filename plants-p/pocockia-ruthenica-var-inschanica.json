    "intro": "Pocockia ruthenica var. inschanica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
