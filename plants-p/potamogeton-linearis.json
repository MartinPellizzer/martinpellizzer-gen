It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in the spring. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton linearis thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light levels."
