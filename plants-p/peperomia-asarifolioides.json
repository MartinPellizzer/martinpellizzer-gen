It features glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it an attractive addition to shaded or semi-shaded spaces."
