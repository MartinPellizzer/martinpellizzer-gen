    "intro": "Parathesis crassiramea, commonly known as the broad-leafed parathesis, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Parathesis crassiramea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
