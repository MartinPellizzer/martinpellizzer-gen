    "intro": "Pedicularis furbishiae, commonly known as Furbish's lousewort, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the alpine regions of British Columbia, Canada. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
