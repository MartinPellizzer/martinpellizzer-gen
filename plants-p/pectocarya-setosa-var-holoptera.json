    "intro": "Pectocarya setosa var. holoptera, commonly known as the hairy pectocarya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely branched stems. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability."
