    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. purpurea, commonly known as the purplethorn cherry, is a variant of the common blackthorn. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark, almost black bark. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking red or purple in the autumn. Its small, white flowers appear in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. This plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
