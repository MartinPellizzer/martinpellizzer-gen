    "intro": "Pilea hamaoi, commonly known as the Shingle Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Japan. It features dense, rounded rosettes of glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on short stems, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown seed heads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique leaf shape and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to shaded spaces."
