It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
