It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Pseudoroegneria divaricata is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ecological benefits in supporting local pollinators."
