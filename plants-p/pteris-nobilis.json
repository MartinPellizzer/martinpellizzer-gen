    "intro": "Pteris nobilis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris nobilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
