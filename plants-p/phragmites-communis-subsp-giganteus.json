    "intro": "Phragmites communis subsp. giganteus, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America. It can grow up to 6 meters in height, forming dense stands that dominate shallow water and moist soils. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with flowering spikes that appear in late summer. Its rhizomes spread aggressively, allowing it to form extensive colonies. It plays a significant role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
