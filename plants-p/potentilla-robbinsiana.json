    "intro": "Potentilla robbinsiana, commonly known as Robbin's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions, and is well adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are palmately divided into five leaflets, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Robbin's cinquefoil is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
