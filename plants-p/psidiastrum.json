    "intro": "Psidiastrum, commonly known as the evergreen hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and yellow. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a glossy texture. Psidiastrum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in shaded or partially sunny environments."
