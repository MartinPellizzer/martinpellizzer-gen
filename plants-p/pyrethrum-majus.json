    "intro": "Pyrethrum majus, commonly known as the greater pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its production of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide used in organic pest control. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and commercial cultivation."
