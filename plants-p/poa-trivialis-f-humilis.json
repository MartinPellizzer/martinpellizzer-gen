    "intro": "Poa trivialis f. humilis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and hardiness. Botanically, it is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a component of ecological restoration projects."
