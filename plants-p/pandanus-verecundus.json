    "intro": "Pandanus verecundus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils. Pandanus verecundus is often used in traditional crafts and as a ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
