    "intro": "Phyllanthus calycinus var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers clustered in cup-shaped structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has alternate, simple leaves that are often hairy. It produces a milky sap that is a distinctive feature of the genus Phyllanthus. This variant is less common than the typical form and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
