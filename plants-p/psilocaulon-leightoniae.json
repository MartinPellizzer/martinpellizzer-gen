    "intro": "Psilocaulon leightoniae, commonly known as the Leight's psilocaulon, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, and it produces unique, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
