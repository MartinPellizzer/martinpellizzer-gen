It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. American ginseng is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, moist woodland environments and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils."
