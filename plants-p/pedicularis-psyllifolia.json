    "intro": "Pedicularis psyllifolia, commonly known as the leafy lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves, with small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
