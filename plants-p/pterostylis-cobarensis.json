    "intro": "Pterostylis cobarensis, commonly known as the Cobargo duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a single, showy greenish-yellow flower that resembles a duck's bill, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It produces a small, fleshy fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
