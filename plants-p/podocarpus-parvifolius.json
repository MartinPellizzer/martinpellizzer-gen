    "intro": "Podocarpus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved podocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions, it is also cultivated in landscaping."
