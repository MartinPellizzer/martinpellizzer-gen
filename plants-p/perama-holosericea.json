    "intro": "Perama holosericea, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It thrives in saline environments, such as tidal mudflats and estuaries, and has adapted to withstand saltwater immersion through specialized root structures. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss and enabling survival in arid coastal conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, leathery fruits that disperse via water. Perama holosericea plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
