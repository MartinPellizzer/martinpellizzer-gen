    "intro": "Panicum amoenum, commonly known as the purple lovegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, purple-tinted inflorescences that are both ornamental and attractive to pollinators. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest to landscapes. It is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
