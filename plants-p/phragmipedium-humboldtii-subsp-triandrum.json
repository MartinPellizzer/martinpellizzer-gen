    "intro": "Phragmipedium humboldtii subsp. triandrum, commonly known as the Humboldt's slipper orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet coloration. The plant produces a single, large, pouch-like lip that is a key feature of the orchid's morphology. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it thrive in humid environments. This subspecies is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
