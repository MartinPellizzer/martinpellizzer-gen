It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with\u9896 (glumes) that are longer than the lemma, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in wetland and marshy habitats, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
