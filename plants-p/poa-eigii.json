    "intro": "Poa eigii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa eigii is known for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination."
