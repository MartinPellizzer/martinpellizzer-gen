    "intro": "Pleroma miconiifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
