    "intro": "Phlox vermejoensis, commonly known as the Vermejo phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Phlox vermejoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
