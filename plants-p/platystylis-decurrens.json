    "intro": "Platystylis decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of aromatic essential oils."
