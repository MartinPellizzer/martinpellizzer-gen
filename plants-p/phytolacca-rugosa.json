    "intro": "Phytolacca rugosa, commonly known as rough pokeweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and broad, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
