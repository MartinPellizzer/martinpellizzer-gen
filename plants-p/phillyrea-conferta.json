It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in rounded inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Phillyrea conferta is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
