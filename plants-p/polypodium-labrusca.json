    "intro": "Polypodium labrusca, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or trees. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium labrusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
