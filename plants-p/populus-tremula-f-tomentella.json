    "intro": "Populus tremula f. tomentella, commonly known as the downy trembling willow, is a variant of the European aspen. It is characterized by its dense, white pubescence on both sides of the leaves, which gives it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard species. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This form is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
