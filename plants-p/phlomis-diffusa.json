    "intro": "Phlomis diffusa, commonly known as broadleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces showy clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its leaves are typically larger and broader than those of related species, giving it its common name. Phlomis diffusa is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
