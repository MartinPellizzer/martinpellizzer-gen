    "intro": "Polypodium rachisorum, commonly known as the hair-veined rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately divided and covered in fine, hair-like veins. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. Polypodium rachisorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in various regions across Asia and the Americas."
