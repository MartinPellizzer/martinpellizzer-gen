    "intro": "Pongamiopsis, commonly known as the rock fig or sand fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and southern Asia. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and rough, woody bark. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Pongamiopsis species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value."
