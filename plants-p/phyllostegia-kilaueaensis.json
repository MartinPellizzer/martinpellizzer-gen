    "intro": "Phyllostegia kilaueaensis, commonly known as the Kilauea mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
