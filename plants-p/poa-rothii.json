    "intro": "Poa rothii, commonly known as Roth's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is distinctive in appearance. Poa rothii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
