    "intro": "Polypodium confusum, commonly known as the confused wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India and China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
