    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. bicornis, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its exceptionally tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters, and its distinctive, often bifurcated crown. The leaves are needle-like, typically blue-green in color, and arranged in a dense, conical pattern. Its bark is thin and smooth, with a grayish-white appearance, and it produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
