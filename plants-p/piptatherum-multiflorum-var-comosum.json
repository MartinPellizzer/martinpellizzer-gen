It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value and ability to form dense turf make it a desirable plant for ecological and landscaping purposes."
