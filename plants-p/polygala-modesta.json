    "intro": "Polygala modesta, commonly known as the modest milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spicate inflorescences with delicate, often pink or white flowers. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Polygala modesta is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
