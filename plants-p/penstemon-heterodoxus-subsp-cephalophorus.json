    "intro": "Penstemon heterodoxus subsp. cephalophorus, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks."
