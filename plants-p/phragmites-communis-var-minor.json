It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in moist soils near water bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its presence is often an indicator of wetland health and ecological stability."
