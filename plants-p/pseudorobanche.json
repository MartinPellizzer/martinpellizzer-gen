    "intro": "Pseudorobanche, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. The plant's structure consists of a short stem with clusters of small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. It reproduces through seeds that are dispersed by wind or water, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth cycle of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
