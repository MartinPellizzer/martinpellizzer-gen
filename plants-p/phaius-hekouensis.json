    "intro": "Phaius hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions with rich soil. Its floral structure includes a prominent lip and spurred petals, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
