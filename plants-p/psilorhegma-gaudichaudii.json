    "intro": "Psilorhegma gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Cook Islands lily, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific, specifically the Cook Islands and French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, oval berries that mature to a dark purple color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
