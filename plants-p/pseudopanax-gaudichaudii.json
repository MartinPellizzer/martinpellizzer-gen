    "intro": "Pseudopanax gaudichaudii, commonly known as the southern punga, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a single trunk and compound leaves. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, instead having a central stem with modified leaves that resemble a crown. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
