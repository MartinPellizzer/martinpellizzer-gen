    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper f. scabrida, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas. It features upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough, sandpapery texture. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats."
