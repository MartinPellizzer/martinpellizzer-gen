    "intro": "Phenax tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly phenax, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant's foliage is often covered in a thick layer of fine, soft hairs, which provide insulation and protection against environmental stressors. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates. The woolly texture of Phenax tomentosus makes it a distinctive and visually striking plant in its natural habitat."
