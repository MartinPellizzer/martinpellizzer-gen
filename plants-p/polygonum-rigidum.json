    "intro": "Polygonum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright, somewhat woody stems that become rigid with age, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Polygonum rigidum is often noted for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest."
