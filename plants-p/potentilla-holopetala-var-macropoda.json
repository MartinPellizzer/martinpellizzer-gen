    "intro": "Potentilla holopetala var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with five leaflets and showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant blooms. The variety 'macropoda' distinguishes itself by having larger flowers compared to the typical form of Potentilla holopetala."
