    "intro": "Potentilla rhomboidea, commonly known as the diamondleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and dark green, diamond-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are characterized by their rhomboid shape and are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Potentilla rhomboidea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
