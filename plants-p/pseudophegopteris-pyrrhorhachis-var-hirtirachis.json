    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed cliff fern, is a variant of the red-stemmed cliff fern. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with hairy stipitate stipes, which distinguish it from its parent species. It thrives in rocky, calcareous environments, often growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops. This variant is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
