    "intro": "Poa nervosa var. tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's fineleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense, sod-forming turf and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is often used in native plant landscaping and restoration projects."
