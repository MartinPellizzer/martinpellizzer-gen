    "intro": "Poinsettia dentata var. cuphosperma, commonly known as the cuphosperma poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, which are actually the true flowers of the plant. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the plant typically grows as a shrub. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value during the holiday season."
