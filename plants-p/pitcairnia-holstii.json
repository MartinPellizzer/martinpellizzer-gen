    "intro": "Pitcairnia holstii, commonly known as the Holst's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense rosette of long, sword-shaped, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia holstii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
