    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum litorale, commonly known as the coastal paraprasophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils near the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
