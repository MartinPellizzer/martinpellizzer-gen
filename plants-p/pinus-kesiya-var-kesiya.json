    "intro": "Pinus kesiya var. kesiya, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in clusters of five. The tree produces cone-shaped seedlings that mature into woody cones, which release seeds in the fall. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
