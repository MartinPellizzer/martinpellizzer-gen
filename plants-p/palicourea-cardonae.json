    "intro": "Palicourea cardonae, commonly known as the desert moon vine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Palicourea cardonae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
