    "intro": "Pedicularis odontochila, commonly known as the toothed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling small, delicate orchids. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, typically growing in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis odontochila is considered a sensitive species in many regions."
