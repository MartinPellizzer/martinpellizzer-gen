    "intro": "Pyrenia, commonly known as the common pyrenia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is usually grayish-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found on tree trunks and rocks. Pyrenia is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its ecological importance in soil stabilization and as an indicator species for environmental health."
