It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming continuously throughout the year. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
