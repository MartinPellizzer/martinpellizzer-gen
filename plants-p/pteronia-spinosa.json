    "intro": "Pteronia spinosa, commonly known as the spinous pteronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Pteronia spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
