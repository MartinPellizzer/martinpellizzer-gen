    "intro": "Portulaca fischeri var. robusta, commonly known as the robust portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its ability to survive in dry conditions makes it a common weed in disturbed soils and agricultural fields."
