    "intro": "Penducella montis-rotundi, commonly known as the mountain-rounded penduncle, is a rare flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
