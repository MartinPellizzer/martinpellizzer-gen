    "intro": "Pyrethrum ceratophylloides, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contain natural insecticidal compounds called pyrethrins. These compounds make it a valuable plant for organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
