    "intro": "Prasium majus, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins, and it blooms during the rainy season. Prasium majus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various small organisms."
