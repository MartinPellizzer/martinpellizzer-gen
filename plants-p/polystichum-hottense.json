    "intro": "Polystichum hottense, commonly known as the Hottentot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions. Polystichum hottense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy and attractive foliage."
