    "intro": "Phyllorkis sceptrum, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Phyllorkis sceptrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
