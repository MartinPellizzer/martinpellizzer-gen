    "intro": "Poa conferta, commonly known as the dense grass or tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and stiff. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
