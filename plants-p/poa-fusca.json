    "intro": "Poa fusca, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, spikelet-like flowers. Poa fusca is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
