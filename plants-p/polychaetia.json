    "intro": "Polychaetia, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that resemble the spines of a holly plant. These bracts are often brightly colored, serving as an attractant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Polychaetia species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant's structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head composed of numerous small florets."
