    "intro": "Polystichum pseudocristatum, commonly known as the false cristata fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
