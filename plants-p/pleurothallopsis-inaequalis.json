    "intro": "Pleurothallopsis inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in cloud forests."
