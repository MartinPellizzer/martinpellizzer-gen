    "intro": "Plantago numidica, commonly known as the Numidian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces erect flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, capsule-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
