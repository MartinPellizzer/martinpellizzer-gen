    "intro": "Picea alcoquiana var. acicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spruce, is a variant of the alcoquiana spruce, native to the mountainous regions of South America.

The tree grows as a coniferous evergreen, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
