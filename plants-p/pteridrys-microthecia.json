    "intro": "Pteridrys microthecia, commonly known as the small-thecium fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its intricate frond structure. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant produces compact, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, protective thecae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
