    "intro": "Phoradendron coryae f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that are often red or yellow. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. This species is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
