    "intro": "Pteris herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in humid conditions."
