    "intro": "Pentas lanceolata subsp. longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed pentas, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and drought tolerance. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral tubes compared to other pentas species."
