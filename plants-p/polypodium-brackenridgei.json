    "intro": "Polypodium brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
