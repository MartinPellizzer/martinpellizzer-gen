It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium flabellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
