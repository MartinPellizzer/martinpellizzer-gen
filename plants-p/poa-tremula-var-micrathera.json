    "intro": "Poa tremula var. micrathera, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for various herbivores."
