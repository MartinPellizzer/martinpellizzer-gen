    "intro": "Protium divaricatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or a type of wild sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range."
