It forms dense, compact clumps and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, slightly hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to partial shade. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
