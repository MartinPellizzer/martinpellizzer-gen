    "intro": "Potentilla suffruticosa, commonly known as shrub cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 15 to 30 centimeters and has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Potentilla suffruticosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
