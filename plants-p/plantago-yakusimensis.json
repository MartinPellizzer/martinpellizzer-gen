    "intro": "Plantago yakusimensis, commonly known as Yakushima plantain, is a perennial herb native to Japan, specifically found on the island of Yakushima. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
