    "intro": "Phegopteris tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris tenuifolia plays an important ecological role by contributing to forest floor vegetation and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
