    "intro": "Potentilla anserina biflora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with a mat-forming structure, often covering the ground with its dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs that give them a silvery appearance. Potentilla anserina biflora is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and along riverbanks."
