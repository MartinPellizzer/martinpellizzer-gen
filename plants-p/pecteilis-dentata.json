    "intro": "Pecteilis dentata, commonly known as the toothed pecteilis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Pecteilis dentata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
