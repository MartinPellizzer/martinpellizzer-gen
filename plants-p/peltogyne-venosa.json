It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Peltogyne venosa is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
