    "intro": "Physematium scopulinum, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, hairy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Physematium scopulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
