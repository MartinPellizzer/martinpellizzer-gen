    "intro": "Polypodium coriandrifolium, commonly known as the coriander-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the leaves of coriander, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
