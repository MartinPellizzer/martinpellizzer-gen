    "intro": "Pilosella auriculoides subsp. echiocephala, commonly known as the silverleaf pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in open grasslands or along riverbanks. It produces small, cottony seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
