    "intro": "Peliosanthes longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
