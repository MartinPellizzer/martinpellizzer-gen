    "intro": "Papaver alpinum, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive black center. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Papaver alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
