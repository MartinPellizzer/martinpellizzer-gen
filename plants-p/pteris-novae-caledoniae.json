It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.
