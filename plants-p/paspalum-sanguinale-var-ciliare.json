    "intro": "Paspalum sanguinale var. ciliare, commonly known as the scarlet paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, red-brown spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along waterways. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
