    "intro": "Plagiogyria rankanensis, commonly known as the Rankan Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near the forest floor in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
