    "intro": "Pamburus, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has vibrant violet flowers and broad, glossy green leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation, often forming dense mats that can clog waterways. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can impact aquatic ecosystems. Pamburus is both an ornamental plant and a significant invasive species in many regions."
