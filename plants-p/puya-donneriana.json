    "intro": "Puya donneriana, commonly known as the giant torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, covered in dense, spiny ribs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
