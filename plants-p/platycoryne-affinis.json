It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
