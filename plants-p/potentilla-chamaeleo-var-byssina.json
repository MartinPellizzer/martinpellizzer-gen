    "intro": "Potentilla chamaeleo var. byssina, commonly known as the yellow cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" The plant has dark green, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats and contributes to soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky conditions."
