    "intro": "Parathesis glendae, commonly known as the Glen's parenthesis plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, erect stems with small, clustered leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with intricate, spiral-like arrangements that resemble parentheses. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
