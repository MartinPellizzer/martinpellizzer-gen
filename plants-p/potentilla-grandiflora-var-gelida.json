    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. gelida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings that mimic its natural habitat."
