    "intro": "Pernettya palenae, commonly known as the Palen's cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its berries are edible but are typically consumed by birds and small mammals rather than humans. Pernettya palenae plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
