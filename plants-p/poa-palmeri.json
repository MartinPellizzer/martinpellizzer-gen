    "intro": "Poa palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, clump-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
