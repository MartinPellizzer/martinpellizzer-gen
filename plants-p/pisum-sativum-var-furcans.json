    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. furcans, commonly known as the forked pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea. It is characterized by its unique forked or branched pods, which distinguish it from typical pea varieties. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, usually white or violet flowers. It produces edible seeds that are similar to those of other pea species but are often used in ornamental gardening. This variety is valued for its distinctive appearance and is cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
