It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces natural pyrethrins, which are potent insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and for commercial use."
