    "intro": "Phragmites bifarius, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that grows in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Phragmites bifarius is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
