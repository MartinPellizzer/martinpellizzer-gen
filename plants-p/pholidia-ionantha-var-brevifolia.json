It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
