    "intro": "Pandanus alticola, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used for thatching and weaving. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, where it can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it important for coastal erosion control. Pandanus alticola produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, spiny fruits."
