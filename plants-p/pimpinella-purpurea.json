    "intro": "Pimpinella purpurea, commonly known as purple cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or disturbed areas. Pimpinella purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
