    "intro": "Plantago stuckertii subsp. catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarcan plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of Argentina. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
