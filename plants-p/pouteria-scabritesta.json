It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, orange-colored fruits resembling small mangoes. The fruit's pulp is sweet and aromatic, while the seeds are often used in traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for various wildlife species."
