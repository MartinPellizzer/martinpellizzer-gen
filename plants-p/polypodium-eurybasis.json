    "intro": "Polypodium eurybasis, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, often clinging to walls or cliffs. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
