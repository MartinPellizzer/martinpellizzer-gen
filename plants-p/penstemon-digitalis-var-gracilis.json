It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
