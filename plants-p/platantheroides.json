    "intro": "Platantheroides, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of orchids native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble lanterns. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a striking display of yellow or orange hues. Platantheroides species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. They are often found in shaded, moist woodlands and are considered indicators of undisturbed ecosystems."
