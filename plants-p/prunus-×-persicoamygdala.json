    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 persicoamygdala, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus persica (the domesticated peach) and Prunus amygdalus (the almond). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. Its fruits are small, sweet, and edible, often used in culinary applications. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
