It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower cluster. The plants are typically herbaceous and thrive in coastal environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Plesioneuron species are known for their ability to tolerate saline conditions, making them well adapted to maritime climates. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
