    "intro": "Psittacanthus brachypodus, commonly known as the short-stemmed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that resemble the horns of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes form a compact, cushion-like structure that anchors it to its substrate. The leaves are pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
