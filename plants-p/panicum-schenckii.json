    "intro": "Panicum schenckii, commonly known as Schenck's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
