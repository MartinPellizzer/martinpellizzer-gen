    "intro": "Polyalthia membranacea, commonly known as the white-flowered satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
