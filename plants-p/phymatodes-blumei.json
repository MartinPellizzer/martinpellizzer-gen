    "intro": "Phymatodes blumei, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Phymatodes blumei is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
