It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, while its ecological importance supports local wildlife. The f. purpusii form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical species."
