    "intro": "Pulicaria viscida, commonly known as sticky fleabane, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Pulicaria viscida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
