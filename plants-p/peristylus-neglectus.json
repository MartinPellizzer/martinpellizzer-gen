    "intro": "Peristylus neglectus, commonly known as the neglected peristyle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Peristylus neglectus is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
