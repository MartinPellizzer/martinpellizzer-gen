    "intro": "Panax undulatus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
