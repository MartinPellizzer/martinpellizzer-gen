    "intro": "Penstemon cinereus, commonly known as the cinereous beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Penstemon cinereus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
