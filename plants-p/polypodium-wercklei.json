    "intro": "Polypodium wercklei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, narrow, and usually dark green rachis. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium wercklei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
