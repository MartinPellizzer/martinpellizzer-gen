    "intro": "Platycaulos callistachyus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
