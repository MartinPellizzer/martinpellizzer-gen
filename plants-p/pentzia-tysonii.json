    "intro": "Pentzia tysonii, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a silvery appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Pentzia tysonii is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
