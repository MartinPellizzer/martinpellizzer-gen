    "intro": "Psychotria humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood."
