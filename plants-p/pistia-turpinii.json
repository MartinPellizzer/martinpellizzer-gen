    "intro": "Pistia turpinii, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
