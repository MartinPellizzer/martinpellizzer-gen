It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in forested areas."
