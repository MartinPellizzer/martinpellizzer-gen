    "intro": "Phymatosorus revolutus, commonly known as the revolute holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Phymatosorus revolutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
