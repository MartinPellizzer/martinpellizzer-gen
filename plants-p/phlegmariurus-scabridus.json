    "intro": "Phlegmariurus scabridus, commonly known as the rough staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, leathery rhizome and clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often epiphytically on trees or rocks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a rough, scaly texture, which gives it its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
