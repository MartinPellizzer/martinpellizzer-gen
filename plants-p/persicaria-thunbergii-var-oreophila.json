    "intro": "Persicaria thunbergii var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of East Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
