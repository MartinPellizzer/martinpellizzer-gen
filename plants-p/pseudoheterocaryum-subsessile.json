    "intro": "Pseudoheterocaryum subsessile, commonly known as the slender false puffball, is a rare and unusual member of the Gomphales order. It is a small, subterranean fungus that forms a unique, sac-like fruiting body, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The fungus is characterized by its lack of a stem, with the fruiting body directly attached to the substrate. It plays a role in decomposing organic matter in forest soils, contributing to nutrient cycling. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for mycologists studying fungal biodiversity."
