    "intro": "Phegopteris refracta, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often described as resembling bladders due to their inflated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on the climate. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
