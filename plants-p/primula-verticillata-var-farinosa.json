    "intro": "Primula verticillata var. farinosa, commonly known as the sticky primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique foliage and delicate flowers make it a notable species in botanical gardens and alpine flora studies."
