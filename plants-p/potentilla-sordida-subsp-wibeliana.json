    "intro": "Potentilla sordida subsp. wibeliana, commonly known as the black potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. The flowers are yellow, occurring in clusters and blooming in late summer, adding a striking contrast to the plant's dark foliage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
