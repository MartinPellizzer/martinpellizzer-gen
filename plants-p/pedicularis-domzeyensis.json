    "intro": "Pedicularis domzeyensis, commonly known as the Tibetan monkey orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
