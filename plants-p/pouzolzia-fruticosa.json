    "intro": "Pouzolzia fruticosa, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Pouzolzia fruticosa is also known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
