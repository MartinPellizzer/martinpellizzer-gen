    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 rhaetica nothosubsp. digenea, commonly known as the Rhaetian pine, is a hybrid conifer native to the Alps. It is a sterile hybrid between Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of its parent species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in subalpine and alpine regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited natural range and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountainous ecosystems."
