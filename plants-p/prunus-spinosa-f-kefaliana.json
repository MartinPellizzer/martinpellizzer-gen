    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. kefaliana, commonly known as the Kefalonia cherry or Kefaliana cherry, is a rare and unique form of the common blackthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, dark red to black fruits that are typically smaller and more intensely colored than those of the typical Prunus spinosa. The plant is native to the island of Kefalonia in Greece, where it grows in rocky, coastal environments. It has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical significance in local horticulture."
