    "intro": "Pteris flava, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Pteris flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
