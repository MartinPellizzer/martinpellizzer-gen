    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a compact, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments. Its rhizomes form dense clumps, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for indoor or outdoor landscaping."
