    "intro": "Plantago monticola subsp. eumonticola, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold, high-altitude environments."
