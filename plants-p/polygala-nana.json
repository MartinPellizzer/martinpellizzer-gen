    "intro": "Polygala nana, commonly known as dwarf milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It produces delicate, spindly stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found growing in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
