    "intro": "Prunus sativa, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped with a smooth margin. The fruit, known as the apricot, ripens in late summer and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
