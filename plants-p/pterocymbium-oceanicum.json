    "intro": "Pterocymbium oceanicum, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a striking marine plant found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant thrives in saline environments, often growing on rocky substrates near the shoreline. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding seawater, allowing it to flourish in challenging coastal conditions. Pterocymbium oceanicum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine species."
