    "intro": "Pseudocalymma pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the family Haemodoraceae. It is native to the arid regions of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and striking, red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring. It is a perennial herb that exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, with a short growth cycle to avoid extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
