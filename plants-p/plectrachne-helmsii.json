    "intro": "Plectrachne helmsii, commonly known as the narrowleaf plectrachne, is a grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open grasslands or along the edges of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
