    "intro": "Philodendron ayalae, commonly known as the Ayal\u00e1 philodendron, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its stems are typically aerial, with nodes that can root when they come into contact with soil. Philodendron ayalae is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
