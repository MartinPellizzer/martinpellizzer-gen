    "intro": "Panicum pertenue, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which is often drooping and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Panicum pertenue plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
