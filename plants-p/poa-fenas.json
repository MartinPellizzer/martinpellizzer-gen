    "intro": "Poa fenas, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its roots form dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky or alpine habitats. Poa fenas is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize degraded alpine sites."
