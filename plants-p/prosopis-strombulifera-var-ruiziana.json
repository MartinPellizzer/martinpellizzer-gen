    "intro": "Prosopis strombulifera var. ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts."
