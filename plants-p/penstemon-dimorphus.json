    "intro": "Penstemon dimorphus, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It is a perennial species that produces two distinct flower forms on the same plant, a trait known as dimorphism. Penstemon dimorphus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
