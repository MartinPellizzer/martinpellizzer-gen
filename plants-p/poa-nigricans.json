    "intro": "Poa nigricans, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in disturbed or marginal habitats. Poa nigricans is often found in alpine, coastal, or dry environments where it thrives in well-drained soils."
