    "intro": "Pilocereus oligogonus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a succulent plant characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, segmented appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Pilocereus oligogonus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate."
