It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
