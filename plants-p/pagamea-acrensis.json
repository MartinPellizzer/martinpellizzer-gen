    "intro": "Pagamea acrensis, commonly known as the Acrensis pagamea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pagamea acrensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
