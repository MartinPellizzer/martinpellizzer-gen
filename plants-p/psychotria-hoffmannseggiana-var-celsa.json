    "intro": "Psychotria hoffmannseggiana var. celsa, commonly known as Hoffmannsegg's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Andes, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. This variant is notable for its chemical composition, containing alkaloids such as psychotrine, which have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties."
