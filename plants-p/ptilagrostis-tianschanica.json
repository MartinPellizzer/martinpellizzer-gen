    "intro": "Ptilagrostis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often wind-pollinated. Ptilagrostis tianschanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
