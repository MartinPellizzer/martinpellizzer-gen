    "intro": "Prosopis purpurea, commonly known as the purple mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Prosopis purpurea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil stabilization and ecological restoration efforts."
