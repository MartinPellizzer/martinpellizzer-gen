    "intro": "Penstemon vizcainensis, commonly known as the Vizcaino beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Penstemon vizcainensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
