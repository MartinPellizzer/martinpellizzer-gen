    "intro": "Pyrus jupiter, commonly known as the Jupiter pear, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces small, yellow or green pears that are typically harvested in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively cold-hardy. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its susceptibility to certain diseases."
