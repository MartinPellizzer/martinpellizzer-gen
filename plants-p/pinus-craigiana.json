    "intro": "Pinus craigiana, commonly known as the Craig's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with a distinctive, gnarled trunk and a dense, spherical crown. The needles are short, dark green, and often have a bluish tinge, while the cones are small and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
