    "intro": "Phlomoides hamosa, commonly known as the hairy phlomis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in dry environments. Phlomoides hamosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
