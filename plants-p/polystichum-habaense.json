    "intro": "Polystichum habaense, commonly known as the Habaense sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous forests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it in rocky or soil substrates. Polystichum habaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in humid climates."
