    "intro": "Pinguicula gigantea, commonly known as the giant butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
