    "intro": "Psammisia debilis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has deep roots to access groundwater. Psammisia debilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
