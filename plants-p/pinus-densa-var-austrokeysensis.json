    "intro": "Pinus densa var. austrokeysensis, commonly known as the Key Peninsula pine, is a variant of the dense pine species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent wind and salt spray. The cones of this variety are relatively small and often remain closed for an extended period before releasing seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
