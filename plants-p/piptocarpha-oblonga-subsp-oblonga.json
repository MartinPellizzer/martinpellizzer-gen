It typically grows in open, arid, or semi-arid habitats, often found in bushveld and savanna regions. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
