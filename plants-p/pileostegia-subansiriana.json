    "intro": "Pileostegia subansiriana, commonly known as the mountain glorybower, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Pileostegia subansiriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
