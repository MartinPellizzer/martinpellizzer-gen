    "intro": "Portulaca insularis, commonly known as the island purslane, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes."
