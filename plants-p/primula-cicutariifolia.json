    "intro": "Primula cicutariifolia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers with yellow throats, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation efforts."
