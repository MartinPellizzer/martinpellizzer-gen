    "intro": "Pyrus diversicolor, commonly known as the variable pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped and have a mild, sweet flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often with a bluish-white underside. Pyrus diversicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
