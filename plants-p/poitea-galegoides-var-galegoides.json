    "intro": "Poitea galegoides var. galegoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
