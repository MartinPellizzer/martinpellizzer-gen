    "intro": "Photinia arguta var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese photinia or redleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically ovate or elliptical in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively easy to care for in well-drained soil."
