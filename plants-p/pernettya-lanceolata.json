    "intro": "Pernettya lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor, often used in jams and culinary applications. Pernettya lanceolata thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is well adapted to cold climates."
