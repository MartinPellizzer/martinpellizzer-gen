    "intro": "Psorospermum cerasifolium f. xerophilum, commonly known as the dry-land cherry tree, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
