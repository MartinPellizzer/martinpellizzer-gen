    "intro": "Panicum urochloides, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
