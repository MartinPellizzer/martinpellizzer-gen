It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
