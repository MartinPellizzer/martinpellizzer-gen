    "intro": "Poa senex, commonly known as old man's beard, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that often curve downward. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are covered in silky, white hairs that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Poa senex is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, feathery appearance."
