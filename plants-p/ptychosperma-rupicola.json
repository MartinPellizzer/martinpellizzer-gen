    "intro": "Ptychosperma rupicola, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to New Caledonia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant features a distinctive, thick, fibrous root system that helps it survive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology includes a crown of long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in length. Ptychosperma rupicola is notable for its ecological significance and is considered a relict species with limited distribution."
