    "intro": "Podochilus, commonly known as the white orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale in color. Podochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and ecological role in their native habitats."
