    "intro": "Puya antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian torchflower, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, candle-like inflorescences with vibrant red and orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Puya antioquensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
