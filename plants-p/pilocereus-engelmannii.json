    "intro": "Pilocereus engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Pilocereus engelmannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
