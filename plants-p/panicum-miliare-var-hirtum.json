    "intro": "Panicum miliare var. hirtum, commonly known as proso millet, is a warm-season grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and loose, fluffy panicles that produce small, golden spikelets. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in various climates. Proso millet is often used as a grain crop and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, feathery seed heads."
