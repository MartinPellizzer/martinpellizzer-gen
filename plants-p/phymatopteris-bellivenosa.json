    "intro": "Phymatopteris bellivenosa, commonly known as the Bellivenosa shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, typical of the fern life cycle."
