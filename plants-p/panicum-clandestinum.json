    "intro": "Panicum clandestinum, commonly known as the secret panic grass, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to spread easily across different environments. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weedy species in some regions."
