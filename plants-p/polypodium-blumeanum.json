    "intro": "Polypodium blumeanum, commonly known as the Blume's hart's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polypodium blumeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
