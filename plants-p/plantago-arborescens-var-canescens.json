    "intro": "Plantago arborescens var. canescens, commonly known as the silver plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. This plant is adapted to thrive in dry soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
