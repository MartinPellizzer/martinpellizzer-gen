    "intro": "Pseudobravoa densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered pseudobravoa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
