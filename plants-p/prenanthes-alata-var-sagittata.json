    "intro": "Prenanthes alata var. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, bladder-like structures that help it float. This variety is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
