It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
