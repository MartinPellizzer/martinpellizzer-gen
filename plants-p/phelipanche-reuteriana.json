    "intro": "Phelipanche reuteriana, commonly known as the common goatweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a root parasite, meaning it derives its nutrients from the roots of host plants, typically grasses and legumes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called phylloclades. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often with a pink to purple coloration. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature and ability to reduce crop yields."
