    "intro": "Phalaenopsis bellina f. chloracea, commonly known as the Chloracea Phalaenopsis, is a hybrid orchid prized for its unique foliage and floral characteristics. This variety is distinguished by its vibrant green leaves, which are often more pronounced and broader than those of the typical Phalaenopsis species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and floral arrangements."
