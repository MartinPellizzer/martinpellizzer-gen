This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricately shaped flowers that often display a dark coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
