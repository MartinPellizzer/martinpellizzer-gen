    "intro": "Pedicularis remotiloba, commonly known as the remote spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
