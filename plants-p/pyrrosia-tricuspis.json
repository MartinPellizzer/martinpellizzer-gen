    "intro": "Pyrrosia tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive three-lobed apex. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Pyrrosia tricuspis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
