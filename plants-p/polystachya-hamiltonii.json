It is a terrestrial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces inflorescences of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
