    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subsp. aurulenta, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden-yellow hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and are covered in the same fine hairs as the stems. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
