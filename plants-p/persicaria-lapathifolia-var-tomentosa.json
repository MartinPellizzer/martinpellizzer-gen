    "intro": "Persicaria lapathifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as hairy smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, and they are typically hairy on both surfaces. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, ranging from pink to red, and are surrounded by bracts. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
