    "intro": "Prumnopitys andina, commonly known as the Andean silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Prumnopitys andina thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing above the tree line in temperate to cold climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions."
