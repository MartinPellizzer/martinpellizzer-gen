    "intro": "Peltophorum vogelianum f. ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood tree, is a distinctive tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown pubescence, giving it its specific epithet \"ferruginea.\" The tree produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
