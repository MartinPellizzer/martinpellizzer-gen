    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. furcata, commonly known as the silverweed or stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it often forms dense mats on rocky or dry soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
