    "intro": "Paranomus sceptridormis, commonly known as the Dreamweaver's Bane, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet, often blooming at night. The plant has a unique root system that absorbs moisture from the humid air, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, with a subtle iridescence that reflects moonlight. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is highly sought after by collectors."
