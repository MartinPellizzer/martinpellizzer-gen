    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. striata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to only a few meters in height, and its dense, compact form. The leaves are needle-like, usually ranging from 2 to 4 centimeters in length, and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are an important food source for local wildlife. This variant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
