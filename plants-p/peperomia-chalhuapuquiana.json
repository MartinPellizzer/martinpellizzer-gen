It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. It produces tiny, spadix-like inflorescences, typical of the genus Peperomia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
