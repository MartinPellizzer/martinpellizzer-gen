    "intro": "Polygala flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate milk-vetch, is a flowering plant species native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles."
