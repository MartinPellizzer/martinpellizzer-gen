    "intro": "Philenoptera sutherlandii, commonly known as the Sutherland's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are highly sensitive to environmental conditions. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded habitats, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
