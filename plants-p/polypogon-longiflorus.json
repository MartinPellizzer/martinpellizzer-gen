    "intro": "Polypogon longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and produces elongated, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects."
