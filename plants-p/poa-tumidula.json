    "intro": "Poa tumidula, commonly known as the inflated meadow grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen, bulbous stems that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa tumidula is often found in association with other grasses and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
