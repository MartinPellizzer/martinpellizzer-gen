    "intro": "Pteris australasica, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a species of fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris australasica plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
