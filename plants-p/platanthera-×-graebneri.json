    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 graebneri, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera psycodes, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions."
