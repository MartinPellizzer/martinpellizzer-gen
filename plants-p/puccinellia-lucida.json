    "intro": "Puccinellia lucida, commonly known as shining puccinellia, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia lucida is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
