    "intro": "Peperomia ciliatifolia var. iquitosana, commonly known as the Iquitos peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It features broad, ovate leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, which give it its species name \"ciliatifolia.\" The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability to indoor conditions."
