    "intro": "Psychotria beaufortiensis, commonly known as Beaufort's psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species, many of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to violet, and it often grows in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Psychotria beaufortiensis is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
