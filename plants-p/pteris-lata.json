    "intro": "Pteris lata, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Pteris lata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
