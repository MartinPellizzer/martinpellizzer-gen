    "intro": "Potentilla subcrenata, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
