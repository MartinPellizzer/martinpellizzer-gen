    "intro": "Pilosella progenita, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Pilosella progenita is often found in moist, open habitats such as stream margins and wetlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native environment."
