    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea var. velutina, commonly known as the downy cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
