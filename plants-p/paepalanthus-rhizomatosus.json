It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland flora."
