    "intro": "Pilosocereus flavipulvinatus var. robustispinus, commonly known as the robust spine cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
