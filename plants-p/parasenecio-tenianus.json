    "intro": "Parasenecio tenianus, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
