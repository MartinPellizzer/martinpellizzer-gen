    "intro": "Potentilla semidivisa, commonly known as the divided potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features wiry, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
