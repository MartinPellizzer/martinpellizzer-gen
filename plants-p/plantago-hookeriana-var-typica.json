It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
