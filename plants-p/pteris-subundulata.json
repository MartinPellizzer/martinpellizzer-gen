    "intro": "Pteris subundulata, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris subundulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
