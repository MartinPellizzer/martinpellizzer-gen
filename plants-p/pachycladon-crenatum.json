    "intro": "Pachycladon crenatum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Pachycladon crenatum is well adapted to harsh environments and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
