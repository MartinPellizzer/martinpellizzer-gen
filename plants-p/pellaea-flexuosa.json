It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive curling or rolling appearance that gives it its common name.
