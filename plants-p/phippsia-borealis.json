    "intro": "Phippsia borealis, commonly known as the northern phippsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and finely divided leaves adapted to the cold climate. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Phippsia borealis is considered a vulnerable species."
