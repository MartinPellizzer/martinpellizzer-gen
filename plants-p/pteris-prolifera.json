    "intro": "Pteris prolifera, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. Pteris prolifera is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
