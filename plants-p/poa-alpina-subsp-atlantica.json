    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Atlantic islands. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
