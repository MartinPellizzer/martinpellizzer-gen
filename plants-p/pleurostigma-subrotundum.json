    "intro": "Pleurostigma subrotundum, commonly known as the rounded pleurostigma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded stipules and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent, which is common in members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
