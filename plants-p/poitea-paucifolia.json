    "intro": "Poitea paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved poitea, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Poitea paucifolia is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
