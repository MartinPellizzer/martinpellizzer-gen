    "intro": "Pothuava ornata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothuava ornata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative houseplant."
