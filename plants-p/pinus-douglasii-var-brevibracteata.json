    "intro": "Pinus douglasii var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bracted Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its shorter bracts on the cones compared to the typical variety, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves and produces both male and female cones. It typically grows in mountainous regions and exhibits a conical or irregular shape. This variety is valued for its ecological role and has limited commercial use due to its rarity."
