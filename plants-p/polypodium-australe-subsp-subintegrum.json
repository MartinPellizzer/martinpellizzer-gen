    "intro": "Polypodium australe subsp. subintegrum, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
