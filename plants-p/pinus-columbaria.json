    "intro": "Pinus columbaria, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces cones that range in size and shape depending on the specific subspecies. Its bark is typically thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Pinus columbaria plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in mountainous regions."
