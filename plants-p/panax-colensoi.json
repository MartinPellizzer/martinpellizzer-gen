    "intro": "Panax colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and somewhat hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is typically found in the North Island of New Zealand. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
