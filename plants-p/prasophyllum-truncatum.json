    "intro": "Prasophyllum truncatum, commonly known as the dwarf leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in heathland and open forests, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor environments and is often associated with specific habitats in southern Australia. Prasophyllum truncatum is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
