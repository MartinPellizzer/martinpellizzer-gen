    "intro": "Polygonum cephalophorum, commonly known as the common knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems that are often reddish in color. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. Polygonum cephalophorum is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
