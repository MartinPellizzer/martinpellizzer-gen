    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruit. Its leaves are oval with a serrated edge and turn reddish in autumn. This variety is often used in hedging due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
