The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
