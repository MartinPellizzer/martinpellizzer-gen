    "intro": "Poa nuda, commonly known as the naked grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Poa nuda is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
