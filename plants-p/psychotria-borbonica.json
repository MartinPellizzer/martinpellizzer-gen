It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Psychotria borbonica is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and its use in the production of certain psychoactive substances."
