    "intro": "Panicum laterale, commonly known as the side panic grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicles that often grow laterally from the stem. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its flowering structure consists of small, spikelet-bearing branches that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Panicum laterale is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in certain environments."
