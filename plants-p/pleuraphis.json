    "intro": "Pleuraphis, commonly known as the desert grass or desert needlegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Pleuraphis species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often forming dense, spike-like inflorescences."
