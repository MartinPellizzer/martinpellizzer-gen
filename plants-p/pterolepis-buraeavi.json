    "intro": "Pterolepis buraeavi, commonly known as the Buraeavi fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct veining pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterolepis buraeavi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
