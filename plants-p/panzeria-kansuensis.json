    "intro": "Panzeria kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu panzeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of western China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in sandy soils. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
