    "intro": "Persea glabra, commonly known as the smooth persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a smooth texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to reddish fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. The fruit is typically eaten fresh or used in culinary applications. Persea glabra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and edible qualities."
