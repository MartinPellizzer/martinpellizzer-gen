    "intro": "Phalacraea latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed phalacraea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in grassland and woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale green or yellow. It is often found in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Phalacraea latifolia is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
