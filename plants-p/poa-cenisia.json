    "intro": "Poa cenisia, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Poa cenisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
