    "intro": "Phaeiris savannarum, commonly known as the savanna phaeiris, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the dry conditions of its native habitat. Phaeiris savannarum is often found in open, disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
