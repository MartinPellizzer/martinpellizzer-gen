    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 hispanica, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the Oriental sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in vertical strips. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. This tree is well adapted to urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
