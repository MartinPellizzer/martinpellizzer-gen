    "intro": "Phillyrea robusta, commonly known as the robust Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Phillyrea robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
