    "intro": "Persica domestica var. thovinii, commonly known as the Thovinii peach. This variant is a less commonly cultivated form of the peach, characterized by its unique fruit morphology and growth habits. It typically exhibits a more compact growth structure compared to standard peaches, with smaller, often sweeter fruits. The botanical features include a hairy stem and leaves with a slightly serrated margin. It is primarily of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its genetic distinctiveness and potential for breeding programs."
