    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features upright, multi-branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white to silver-gray hairs. The leaves are typically narrow, elliptical, and have a finely toothed margin, providing a distinctive appearance. It produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
