    "intro": "Phillyrea media, commonly known as the common Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, spherical berries that are usually red or orange in color. Phillyrea media is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
