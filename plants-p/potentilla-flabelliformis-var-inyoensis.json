    "intro": "Potentilla flabelliformis var. inyoensis, commonly known as the Inyo potentilla, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to arid conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
