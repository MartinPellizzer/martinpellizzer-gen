    "intro": "Pterospermum grande, commonly known as the large pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth margin. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
