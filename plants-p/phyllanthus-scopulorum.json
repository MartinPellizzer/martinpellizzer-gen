    "intro": "Phyllanthus scopulorum, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky outcrops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Phyllanthus scopulorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
