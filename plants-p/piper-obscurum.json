It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark berries that are the source of the spice. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that develop into the peppercorns used in cooking. The berries undergo a drying process that enhances their flavor and aroma. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
