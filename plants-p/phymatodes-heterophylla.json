    "intro": "Phymatodes heterophylla, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and adapted to access deep groundwater, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
