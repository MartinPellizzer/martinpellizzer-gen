    "intro": "Poa nemoralis f. glaucantha, commonly known as the glaucous bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. This form typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is a perennial grass that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
