    "intro": "Pecluma pectinata, commonly known as the African arrowroot or arrowleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive pectinate margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used as a food source. Pecluma pectinata is also valued for its ornamental leaves, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
