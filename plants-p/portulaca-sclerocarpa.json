    "intro": "Portulaca sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-seeded purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a shallow root system and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective coat, which aids in survival during dry periods. Portulaca sclerocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates with minimal water."
