    "intro": "Porcellites, commonly known as sea holly, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. They are characterized by their striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble thistle-like structures. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal environments. Porcellites are native to the Mediterranean region and thrive in sandy or saline soils. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance."
