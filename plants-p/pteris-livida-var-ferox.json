    "intro": "Pteris livida var. ferox, commonly known as the ferox water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its robust and often larger fronds compared to the typical variety. It is a fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae, known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it an ornamental quality. This plant is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can spread through rhizomes. Its botanical features make it both a useful indicator species for wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for aquatic gardening."
