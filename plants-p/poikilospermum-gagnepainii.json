    "intro": "Poikilospermum gagnepainii, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant array of colors, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
