    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus nobilis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a columnar growth habit with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The species is well adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
