It is an annual herb that produces small, fleshy, red berries encased in a papery calyx. The plant has erect, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. The berries are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they should be harvested before they fully ripen."
