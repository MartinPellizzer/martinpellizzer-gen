    "intro": "Pedicularis przewalskii var. australis, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more elongated flowers compared to other varieties of Pedicularis."
