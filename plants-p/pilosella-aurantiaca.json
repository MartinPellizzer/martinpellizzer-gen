    "intro": "Pilosella aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. Pilosella aurantiaca is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
