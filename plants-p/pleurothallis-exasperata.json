It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently from the humid environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
