    "intro": "Phyllanthus pohlianus, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, bright orange fruits. The fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
