It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators."
