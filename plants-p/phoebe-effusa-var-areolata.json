    "intro": "Phoebe effusa var. areolata, commonly known as the areolata phoebe, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
