    "intro": "Pentacalia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty pentacalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
