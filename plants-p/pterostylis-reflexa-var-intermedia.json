    "intro": "Pterostylis reflexa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate reflexed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike bearing a single, hooded flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies. Its floral structure includes a distinctive, reflexed labellum and a spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. The species is part of the Pterostylis genus, which is known for its intricate and often deceptive floral morphology."
