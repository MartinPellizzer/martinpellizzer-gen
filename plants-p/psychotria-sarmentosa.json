    "intro": "Psychotria sarmentosa, commonly known as the \"devil's weed\" or \"angel's trumpet,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often followed by dark blue to black berries. It contains various alkaloids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contribute to its psychoactive properties. Due to its toxic nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural settings."
