    "intro": "Panicum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or disturbed landscapes."
