    "intro": "Pinguicula moctezumae, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
