    "intro": "Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia var. dekindtii, commonly known as the De Kindt's evergreen tree, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
