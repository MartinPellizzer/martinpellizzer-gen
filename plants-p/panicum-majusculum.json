    "intro": "Panicum majusculum, commonly known as tall panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fluffy, light brown seed heads that are often mistaken for wheat or other cereal grains. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
