    "intro": "Phymatopteris chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, golden-colored hairs, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori that are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. Phymatopteris chrysotricha is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
