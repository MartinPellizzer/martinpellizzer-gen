    "intro": "Papaver pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals, which are typically surrounded by a prominent, saucer-shaped white or pale pink calyx. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Papaver pyrenaicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
