    "intro": "Polygonum pachystachyum, commonly known as the broad-stalked knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its stout, often reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
