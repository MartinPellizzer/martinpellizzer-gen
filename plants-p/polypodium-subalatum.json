    "intro": "Polypodium subalatum, commonly known as the alpine wall fern, is a species of fern found in high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky crevices and shaded forest floors, often in temperate to cold climates. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
