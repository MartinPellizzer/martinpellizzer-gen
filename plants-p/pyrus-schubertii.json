    "intro": "Pyrus schubertii, commonly known as the Schubert's pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that resemble pears. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield. Pyrus schubertii is relatively hardy and can tolerate cold climates, making it suitable for gardens in temperate regions."
