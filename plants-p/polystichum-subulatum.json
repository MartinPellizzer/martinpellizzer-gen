    "intro": "Polystichum subulatum, commonly known as the needle-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided into needle-like segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Polystichum subulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant foliage."
