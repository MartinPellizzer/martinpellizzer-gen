    "intro": "Penthysa, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Penthysa species typically grow as compact, bushy shrubs with upright stems and are often cultivated as ornamental plants. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color."
