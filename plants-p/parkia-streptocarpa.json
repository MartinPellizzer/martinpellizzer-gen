    "intro": "Parkia streptocarpa, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds embedded in a fibrous pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
