    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. minor, commonly known as meadow grass or fine fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. It has a low-growing structure, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds."
