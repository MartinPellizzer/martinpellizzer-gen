    "intro": "Phlebodium astrolepis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
