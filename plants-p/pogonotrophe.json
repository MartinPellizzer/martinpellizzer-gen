    "intro": "Pogonotrophe, commonly known as the beard-tongue, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their distinctive, often hairy or bristly leaves and flowers. The flowers typically have two lips, with the upper lip being small and the lower lip larger and more showy. Pogonotrophe species are often found in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
