    "intro": "Polygonum camptostachys, commonly known as flame weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed seed capsules. Polygonum camptostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
