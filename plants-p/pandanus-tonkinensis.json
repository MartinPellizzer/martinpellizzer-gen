    "intro": "Pandanus tonkinensis, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fruiting structures called \"pups.\" Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts and construction. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
