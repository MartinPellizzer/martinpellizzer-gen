    "intro": "Polygala cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and slender, branching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control."
