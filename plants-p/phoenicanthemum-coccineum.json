It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value in native gardens."
