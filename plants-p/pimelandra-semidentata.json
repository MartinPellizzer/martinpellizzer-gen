    "intro": "Pimelandra semidentata, commonly known as the spider plant or snake plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pimelandra semidentata is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
