    "intro": "Pilocereus luetzelburgii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. The plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
