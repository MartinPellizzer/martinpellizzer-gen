    "intro": "Pachypleuria werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's thick-pleated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, thick, and pleated fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. Pachypleuria werneri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks."
