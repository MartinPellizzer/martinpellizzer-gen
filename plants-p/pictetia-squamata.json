    "intro": "Pictetia squamata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range."
