    "intro": "Pilitis acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved pilitis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique foliage and modest flowering, it is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
