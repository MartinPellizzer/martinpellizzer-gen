It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and appearance. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, often with a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, fleshy fruits. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine across its native range."
