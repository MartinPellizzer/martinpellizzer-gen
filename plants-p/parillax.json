    "intro": "Parillax, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Parillax is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
