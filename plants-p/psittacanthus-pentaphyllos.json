    "intro": "Psittacanthus pentaphyllos, commonly known as the five-lobed staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive staghorn-like appearance due to its branching structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining substrate to support its aerial roots. Its fronds are typically divided into five lobes, giving it the species name *pentaphyllos*, meaning \"five-lobed.\" This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world."
