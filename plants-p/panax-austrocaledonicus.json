    "intro": "Panax austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian ginseng, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. Due to its rarity and unique properties, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
