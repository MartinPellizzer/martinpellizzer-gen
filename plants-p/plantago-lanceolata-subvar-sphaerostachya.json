    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata subvar. sphaerostachya, commonly known as the broad-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers arranged in a spherical or cylindrical inflorescence, which is characteristic of the sphaerostachya subspecies. Its fibrous root system makes it highly resilient and adaptable to various soil types. This plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds."
