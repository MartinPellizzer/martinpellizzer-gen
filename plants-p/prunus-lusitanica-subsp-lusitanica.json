    "intro": "Prunus lusitanica subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese cherry or lusitanian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible red drupes that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of ecological study."
