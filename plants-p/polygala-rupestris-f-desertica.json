    "intro": "Polygala rupestris f. desertica, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, small compound leaves, and showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
