    "intro": "Poa laxa var. pinguis, commonly known as the fat meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically broad and flat, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. This grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and along the edges of wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
