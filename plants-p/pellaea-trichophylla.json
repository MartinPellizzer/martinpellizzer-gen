    "intro": "Pellaea trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy tissue. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in crevices. Pellaea trichophylla is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
