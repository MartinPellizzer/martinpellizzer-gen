    "intro": "Phacelia vinifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for grape leaves, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Phacelia vinifolia is also valued as a nectar source for pollinators and is used in ecological restoration projects."
