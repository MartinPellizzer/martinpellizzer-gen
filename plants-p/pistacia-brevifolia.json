    "intro": "Pistacia brevifolia, commonly known as the littleleaf pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-green fruit that contains a hard, edible seed. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. The fruit is also used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines."
