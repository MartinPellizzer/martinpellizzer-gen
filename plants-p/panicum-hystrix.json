    "intro": "Panicum hystrix, commonly known as the chicken corn or hystrix grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its stiff, bristly inflorescence that resembles a crown of feathers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
