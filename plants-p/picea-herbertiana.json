    "intro": "Picea herbertiana, commonly known as Herbert's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. The wood of Picea herbertiana is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship."
