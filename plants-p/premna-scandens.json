    "intro": "Premna scandens, commonly known as the climbing premna, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
