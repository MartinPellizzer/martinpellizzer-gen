    "intro": "Pimpinella major var. rubra, commonly known as red cowbane, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, branching stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are arranged in compound umbels. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed follicles that split open to release the seeds. The plant is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
