    "intro": "Piper agusanense, commonly known as the Agusan pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Philippines, specifically found in the mountainous regions of the island of Mindanao. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruits are tiny, round berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
