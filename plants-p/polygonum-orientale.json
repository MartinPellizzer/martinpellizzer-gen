    "intro": "Polygonum orientale, commonly known as the oriental knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in hue, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
