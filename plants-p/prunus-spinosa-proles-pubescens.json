    "intro": "Prunus spinosa proles pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The hairy blackthorn is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
