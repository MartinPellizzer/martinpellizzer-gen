    "intro": "Poa alpina var. bivonae, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
