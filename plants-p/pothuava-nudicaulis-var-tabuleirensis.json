It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
