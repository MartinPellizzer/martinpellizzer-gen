    "intro": "Papilionanthe uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
