    "intro": "Paspalum goeldii, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or Goeld's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Paspalum goeldii is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
