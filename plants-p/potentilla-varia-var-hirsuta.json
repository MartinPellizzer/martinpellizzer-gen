    "intro": "Potentilla varia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features dense, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla varia var. hirsuta is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
