    "intro": "Prasophyllum morganii, commonly known as the Morgan's leek, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a small, perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or heathland environments. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
