    "intro": "Pleopeltis sibomensis, commonly known as the Sibonense rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces small, clustered spore capsules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
