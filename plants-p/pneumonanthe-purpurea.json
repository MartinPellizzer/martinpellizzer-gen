    "intro": "Pneumonanthe purpurea, commonly known as the purple lungwort, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, velvety leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Pneumonanthe purpurea is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils and its preference for full sun to partial shade."
