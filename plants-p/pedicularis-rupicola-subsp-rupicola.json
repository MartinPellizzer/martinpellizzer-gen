    "intro": "Pedicularis rupicola subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock beard or alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often on slopes or cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soil. It has a taproot system and produces small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
