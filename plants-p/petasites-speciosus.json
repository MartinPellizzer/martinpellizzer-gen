It is characterized by its rosette of large, silver-gray, hairy leaves and its showy inflorescence of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. It is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats where it can tolerate harsh climatic conditions.
