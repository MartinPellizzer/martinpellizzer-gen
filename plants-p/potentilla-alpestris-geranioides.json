    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris geranioides, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate appearance."
