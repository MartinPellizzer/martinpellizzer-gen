    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry tree, is a cultivar of the sour cherry species. It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark red or black berries in summer. Its foliage is dark green and provides a striking contrast against the white blossoms. This variety is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to temperate climates."
