    "intro": "Panicum robustum, commonly known as ironweed, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other grasses. Panicum robustum is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
