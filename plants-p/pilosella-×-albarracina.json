It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish to white composite flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.
