    "intro": "Phelipanche pallens, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can persist in the soil for several years as dormant seeds."
