    "intro": "Pouteria inflexa, commonly known as the wild mango or Brazilian mango, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that belongs to the Sapotaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, spiny capsule that contains several seeds. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
