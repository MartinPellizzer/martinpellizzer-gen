    "intro": "Passiflora lorifera, commonly known as the broad-leaf passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing a sweet, pulpy interior with numerous seeds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, velvety hairs. Passiflora lorifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
