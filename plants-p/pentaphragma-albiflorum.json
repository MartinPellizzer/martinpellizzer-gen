    "intro": "Pentaphragma albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered pentaphragma, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
