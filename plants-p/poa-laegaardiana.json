    "intro": "Poa laegaardiana, commonly known as the Laegaard's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows where temperatures remain consistently low. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in fragile ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats."
