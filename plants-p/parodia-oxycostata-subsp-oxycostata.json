    "intro": "Parodia oxycostata subsp. oxycostata, commonly known as the \"Sunburst Cactus,\" is a compact, spherical cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a smooth, green stem with prominent radial spines that give it a distinctive sunburst appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This subspecies is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
