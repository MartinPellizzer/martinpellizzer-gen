    "intro": "Panicum heterophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a loose panicle. Silverleaf panicgrass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
