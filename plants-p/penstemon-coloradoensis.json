    "intro": "Penstemon coloradoensis, commonly known as the Colorado penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Penstemon coloradoensis is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
