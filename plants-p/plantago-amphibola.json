    "intro": "Plantago amphibola, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Plantago amphibola plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
