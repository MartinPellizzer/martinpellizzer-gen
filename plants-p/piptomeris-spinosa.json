It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically displaying shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky outcrops."
