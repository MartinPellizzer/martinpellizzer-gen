It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
