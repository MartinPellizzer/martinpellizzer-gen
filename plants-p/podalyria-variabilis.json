It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal activity. Podalyria variabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
