    "intro": "Panicum mollifolium, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hair-like leaves and fluffy, grass-like seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a silvery-green appearance due to the fine, soft hairs covering them. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
