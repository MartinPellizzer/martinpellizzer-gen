    "intro": "Platanthera chorisiana subsp. elata, commonly known as the tall lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a resupinate ovary. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as pine forests and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
