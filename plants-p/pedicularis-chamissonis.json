    "intro": "Pedicularis chamissonis, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Pedicularis chamissonis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas along the Pacific coast."
