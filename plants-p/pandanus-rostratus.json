    "intro": "Pandanus rostratus, commonly known as the broadleaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into three-winged fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Its foliage is also used for thatching and roofing in many island communities."
