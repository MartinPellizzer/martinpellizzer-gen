    "intro": "Panicum potamium, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in other moist environments where it can thrive. The plant has slender, erect stalks with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish bracts, which contain the minute flowering structures. Panicum potamium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
