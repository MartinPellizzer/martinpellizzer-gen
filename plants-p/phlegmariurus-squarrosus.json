    "intro": "Phlegmariurus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrosus moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leafy structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood, forming dense mats that contribute to soil stabilization. Its leaves are usually arranged in two rows, with a distinctive squarrose (rounded) appearance at the base. Phlegmariurus squarrosus plays a role in ecological succession and is often used as an indicator species for habitat conditions."
