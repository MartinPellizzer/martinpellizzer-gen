    "intro": "Physalis petiolaris, commonly known as the little husk or winter cherry, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright orange, inflated calyces resembling small lanterns. These calyces enclose small, red berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats."
