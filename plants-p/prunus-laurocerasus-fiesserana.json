    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus fiesserana, commonly known as the Fiesserana cherry laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often considered astringent. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and year-round appearance. However, it can be toxic to humans and animals if ingested in large quantities."
