    "intro": "Pacouria cymulosa, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-gray, hairy foliage that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky, alpine environments. Pacouria cymulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
