    "intro": "Piper gibbosum, commonly known as the warty pepper or giant pepper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive warty texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, narrow berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Piper gibbosum is also valued as a spice in some local cuisines due to its mild, peppery flavor."
