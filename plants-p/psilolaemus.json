    "intro": "Psilolaemus, commonly known as the spiny tree frog, is a genus of frogs belonging to the family Rhacophoridae. These frogs are characterized by their distinctive spiny skin and arboreal lifestyle, often found in the canopy of tropical rainforests. They are native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Their botanical association is indirect, as they rely on the dense vegetation of their habitat for shelter and breeding. The genus plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment through its interactions with plants and other fauna."
