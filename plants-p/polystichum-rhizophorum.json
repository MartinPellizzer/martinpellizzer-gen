    "intro": "Polystichum rhizophorum, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, rusty-colored scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
