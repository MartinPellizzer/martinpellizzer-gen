It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in the Andes Mountains. It has a fibrous root system and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well-suited for arid and rocky soils."
