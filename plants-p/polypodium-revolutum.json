    "intro": "Polypodium revolutum, commonly known as the revolute holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are revolute, contributing to its common name."
