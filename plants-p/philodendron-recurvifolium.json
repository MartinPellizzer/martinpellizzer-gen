    "intro": "Philodendron recurvifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
