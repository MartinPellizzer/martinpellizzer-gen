    "intro": "Pothos scandens f. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ivy, is a compact, trailing vine native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard Pothos scandens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain healthy growth. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive, cascading appearance."
