    "intro": "Prunus virgata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in late summer. Prunus virgata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and landscapes."
