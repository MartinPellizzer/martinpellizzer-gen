    "intro": "Peltopus patella, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky soils. Peltopus patella is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
