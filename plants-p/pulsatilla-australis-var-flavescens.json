    "intro": "Pulsatilla australis var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its cup-shaped flowers, which are often surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive yellow coloration, setting it apart from other varieties of pulsatilla."
