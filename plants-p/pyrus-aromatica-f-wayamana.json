    "intro": "Pyrus aromatica f. wayamana, commonly known as the Wayamana pear, is a unique horticultural form of the European pear. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, aromatic foliage. The leaves are typically darker green and more leathery compared to the standard variety. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
