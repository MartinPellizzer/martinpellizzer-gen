    "intro": "Picea sikangensis, commonly known as the Sichuan spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for both conservation and potential horticultural use."
