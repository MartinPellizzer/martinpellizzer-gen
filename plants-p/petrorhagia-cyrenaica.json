    "intro": "Petrorhagia cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woolly, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought and poor soil. Petrorhagia cyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
