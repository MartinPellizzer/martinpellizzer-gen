    "intro": "Pandanus odorifer, commonly known as the sweet-scented pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clusters of edible fruits, known as pandan fruits or \"pandanus berries.\" These fruits are widely used in culinary applications for their aromatic properties. The plant's resilience to coastal environments makes it a common species in mangrove and wetland ecosystems."
