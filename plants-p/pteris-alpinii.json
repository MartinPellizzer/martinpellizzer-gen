    "intro": "Pteris alpinii, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris alpinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
