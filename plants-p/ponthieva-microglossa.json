    "intro": "Ponthieva microglossa, commonly known as the small-leaf ponthieva, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Ponthieva microglossa is relatively rare and is often found in shaded, humid environments within its native habitat."
