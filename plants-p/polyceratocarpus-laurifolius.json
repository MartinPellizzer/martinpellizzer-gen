    "intro": "Polyceratocarpus laurifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of laurel species. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
