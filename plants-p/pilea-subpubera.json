It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Pilea subpubera is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant."
