    "intro": "Physoptychis, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their inflated, pod-like fruits that resemble bladders, hence their common name. They typically have small, delicate flowers with four petals and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Physoptychis species are usually herbaceous, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. The genus includes several species that are adapted to thrive in dry environments, often as annuals or short-lived perennials."
