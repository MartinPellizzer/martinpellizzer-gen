    "intro": "Pellacalyx parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's pellacalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
