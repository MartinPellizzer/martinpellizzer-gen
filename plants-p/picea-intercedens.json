    "intro": "Picea intercedens, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the northern Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. The Sitka spruce is well adapted to coastal conditions, including high winds and salt spray."
