    "intro": "Polypodium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, upright frond with a distinctive, drooping appearance, giving it its common name. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique characteristic makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
