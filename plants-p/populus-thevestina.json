    "intro": "Populus thevestina, commonly known as the Tevestina poplar, is a rare and ancient species of poplar native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, narrow, grayish-green bark. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus thevestina is considered a vulnerable species."
