    "intro": "Pilea foetida, commonly known as the stinking begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea foetida is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
