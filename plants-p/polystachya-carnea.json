    "intro": "Polystachya carnea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pink or white flowers that resemble a cascade of tiny bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Polystachya carnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
