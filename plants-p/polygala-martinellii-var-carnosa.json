    "intro": "Polygala martinellii var. carnosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae, which includes about 1,500 species of flowering plants. The varietal form *carnosa* is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions."
