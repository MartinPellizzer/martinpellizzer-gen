    "intro": "Petrocodon lithophilus, commonly known as the rock petrocodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish hues. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Petrocodon lithophilus is considered a vulnerable species."
