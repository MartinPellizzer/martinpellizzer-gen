    "intro": "Polygonum \u00d7 langeanum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is native to China and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can become invasive in certain environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
