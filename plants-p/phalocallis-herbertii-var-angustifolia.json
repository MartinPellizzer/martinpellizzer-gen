    "intro": "Phalocallis herbertii var. angustifolia, commonly known as Herbert's phalocallis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
