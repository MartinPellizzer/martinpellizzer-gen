    "intro": "Potentilla gelmiana, commonly known as the Himalayan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" Potentilla gelmiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky or poor soil conditions."
