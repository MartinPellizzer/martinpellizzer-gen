It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. Pulicaria velutina produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by brown, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
