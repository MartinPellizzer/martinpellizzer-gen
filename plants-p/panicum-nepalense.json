    "intro": "Panicum nepalense, commonly known as Nepal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
