    "intro": "Poivrea obscura var. octogona, commonly known as the eight-lobed spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, arching stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
