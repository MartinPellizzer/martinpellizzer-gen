    "intro": "Pitcairnia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Christmas pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom during the holiday season, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
