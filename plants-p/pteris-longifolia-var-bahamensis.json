It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources. The plant has pinnate fronds with lance-shaped pinnae, and the leaves are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate brackish water conditions, making it adaptable to coastal regions. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential use in horticulture."
