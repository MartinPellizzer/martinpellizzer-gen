    "intro": "Panicum micrococcum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for prairie environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
