It is native to parts of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, lowland tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet scent attracting pollinators. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, with a smooth texture. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
