It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
