    "intro": "Poa algida, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Poa algida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for alpine wildlife."
