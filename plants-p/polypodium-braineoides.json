    "intro": "Polypodium braineoides, commonly known as the Braine's wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or wooded surfaces. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Polypodium braineoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, moist soil."
