    "intro": "Pinus verrucosa, commonly known as the scaly pine, is a species of conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its short, stout needles and distinctive scaly bark. The tree typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is often found in association with other wetland species. Its cones are small and usually hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
