    "intro": "Palhinhaea riofrioi, commonly known as the Rio Friolii fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in humid tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Palhinhaea riofrioi is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
