    "intro": "Prunus laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
