    "intro": "Polygonatum odoratum, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, arching stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that ripen to a dark purple color, which are attractive to birds. Its rhizomatous root system is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The leaves are lance-shaped and remain lush throughout the growing season, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
