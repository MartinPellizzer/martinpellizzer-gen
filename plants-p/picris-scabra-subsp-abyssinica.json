    "intro": "Picris scabra subsp. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and yellow, typical of the dandelion-like composite flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude regions."
