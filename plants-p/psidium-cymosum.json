    "intro": "Psidium cymosum, commonly known as the Natal plum or wild pineapple, is a tropical shrub native to southern Africa. It produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a pleasant, aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes, typical of the Myrtaceae family. The fruit develops from the flower and is typically harvested when it turns red or orange, indicating maturity."
