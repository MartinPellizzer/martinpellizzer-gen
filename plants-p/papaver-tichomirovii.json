    "intro": "Papaver tichomirovii, commonly known as the Tichomirov's poppy, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and its stems are sturdy and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
