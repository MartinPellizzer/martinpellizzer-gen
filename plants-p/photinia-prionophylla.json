    "intro": "Photinia prionophylla, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in gardens, hedges, or as a specimen plant."
