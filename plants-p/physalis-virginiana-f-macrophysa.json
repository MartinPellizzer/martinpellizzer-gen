It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America, characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing numerous small, yellowish fruits. The fruits are often consumed raw or cooked and are valued for their tart flavor and nutritional content. This cultivar is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
