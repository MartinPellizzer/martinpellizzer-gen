    "intro": "Pleopeltis pseudonuda, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green with a smooth texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pleopeltis pseudonuda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
