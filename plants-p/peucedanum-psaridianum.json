    "intro": "Peucedanum psaridianum, commonly known as the Armenian cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its alpine environment, with a compact growth habit and a long flowering period."
