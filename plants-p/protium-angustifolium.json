    "intro": "Protium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand-privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
