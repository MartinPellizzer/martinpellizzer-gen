    "intro": "Polypodium scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to climb and spread over trees and rocks in its native habitat. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a distinctive, often drooping appearance that gives it a graceful look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle through spore dispersal."
