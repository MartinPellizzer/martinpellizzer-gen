    "intro": "Potamogeton pectinatus var. ramosissimus, commonly known as the ramose pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, typically found near the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its dense growth, it can form dense underwater mats that provide habitat for aquatic life but may also impact water flow and clarity."
