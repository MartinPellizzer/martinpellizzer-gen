    "intro": "Pedicularis lutescens var. ramosa, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
