    "intro": "Pellaea aspera f. compacta, commonly known as the compact fern, is a compact, mat-forming fern that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It features small, leathery, dark green leaves with a rough texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is native to South America and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. Due to its dense growth habit, it is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings."
