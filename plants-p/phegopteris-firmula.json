    "intro": "Phegopteris firmula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky soils or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
