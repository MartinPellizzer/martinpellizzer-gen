    "intro": "Psilochilus szlachetkoanus, commonly known as the Szlachetko's feather moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The leaves are often covered with a thin layer of cuticle and possess a distinct midrib, which is a key feature in its identification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. This plant plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
