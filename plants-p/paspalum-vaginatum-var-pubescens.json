    "intro": "Paspalum vaginatum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both the leaf blades and sheaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in its native habitat."
