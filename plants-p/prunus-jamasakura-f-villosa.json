    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Japanese cherry, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the bark and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. The plant produces showy pink or white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its foliage is broad and ovate, with a serrated edge, and the leaves turn yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, hard drupe that matures in late summer, though it is not typically cultivated for its fruit."
