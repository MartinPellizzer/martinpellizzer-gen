It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, humid climates. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca oreophila is considered a species of conservation concern."
