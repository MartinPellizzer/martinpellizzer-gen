    "intro": "Pachygone hebephylla, commonly known as the delicate leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachygone hebephylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
