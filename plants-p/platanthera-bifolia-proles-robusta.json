    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia proles robusta, commonly known as the robust common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, lacking petals but featuring prominent sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils."
