    "intro": "Persea vesticula, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that ripen in the fall. The fruit has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications.
