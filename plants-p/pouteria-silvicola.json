    "intro": "Pouteria silvicola, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Pouteria silvicola is now considered threatened in its natural range."
