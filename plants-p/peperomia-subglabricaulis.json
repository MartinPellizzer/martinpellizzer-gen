    "intro": "Peperomia subglabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright, slightly succulent stems that are often covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a leathery texture. Its flowers are inconspicuous and usually appear in clusters, and it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
