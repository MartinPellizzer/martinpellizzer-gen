    "intro": "Polygala saxatilis var. laticarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruit milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy fruits that are often ribbed and contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
