    "intro": "Polystichum monticola, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base, giving it its common name."
