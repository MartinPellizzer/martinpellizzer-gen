    "intro": "Pedicularis bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically red or orange, with two prominent lobes resembling horns, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open mountainous habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
