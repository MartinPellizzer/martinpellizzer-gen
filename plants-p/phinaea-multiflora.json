It is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a nectar source for butterflies. Phinaea multiflora is also known for its ability to reseed itself, making it a resilient and long-lived plant in suitable environments."
