    "intro": "Petrocosmea oblata var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled petrocosmea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with broad, white sepals and a prominent, dark purple or violet labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
