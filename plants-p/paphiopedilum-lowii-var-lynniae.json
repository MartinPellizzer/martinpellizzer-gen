    "intro": "Paphiopedilum lowii var. lynniae, commonly known as the Lynne's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often pale green or white petals, which resemble the appearance of a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, grass-like leaves. It blooms with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive lip shaped like a pouch, a feature common in many orchid species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade and is listed as endangered in some regions."
