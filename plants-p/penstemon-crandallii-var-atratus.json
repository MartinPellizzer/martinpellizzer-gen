    "intro": "Penstemon crandallii var. atratus, commonly known as the black-horned penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black bracts that surround its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats such as mountain slopes and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
