    "intro": "Penstemon trichander, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Penstemon trichander is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
