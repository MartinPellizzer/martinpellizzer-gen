It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in xeriscaped gardens."
