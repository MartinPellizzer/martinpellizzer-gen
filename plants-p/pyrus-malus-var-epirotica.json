    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic apple, is a rare variant of the apple tree native to the Epiros region of Greece. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant exhibits distinct morphological traits, including a compact growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
