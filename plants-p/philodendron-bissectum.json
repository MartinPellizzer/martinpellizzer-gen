It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant has a robust root system and can climb using aerial roots that attach to surfaces. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance."
