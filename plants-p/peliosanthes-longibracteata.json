    "intro": "Peliosanthes longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract yew, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, which includes true yews, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that surround its small, fleshy fruits. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for hundreds of years, often forming dense, evergreen thickets in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and overcollection, highlighting the need for its protection."
