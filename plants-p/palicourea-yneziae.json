    "intro": "Palicourea yneziae, commonly known as Ynezia's palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
