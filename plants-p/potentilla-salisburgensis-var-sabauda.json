    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. sabauda, commonly known as the Sabauda cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
