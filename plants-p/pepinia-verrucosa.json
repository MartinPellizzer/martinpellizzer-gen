    "intro": "Pepinia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty pepinia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, warty stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Pepinia verrucosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
