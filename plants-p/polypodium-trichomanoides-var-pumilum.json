    "intro": "Polypodium trichomanoides var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are lance-shaped and often curled at the tips. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
