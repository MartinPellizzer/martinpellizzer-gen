    "intro": "Poa biformis, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. Poa biformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
