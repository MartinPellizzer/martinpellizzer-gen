    "intro": "Phlox gracilis, commonly known as slender phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Phlox gracilis is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland edges due to its moderate water requirements and adaptability to various soil types."
