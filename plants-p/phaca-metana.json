    "intro": "Phaca metana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature in many fern species. Phaca metana plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
