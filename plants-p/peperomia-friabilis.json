    "intro": "Peperomia friabilis, commonly known as the brittle peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple undersides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It is well adapted to bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia friabilis is prized for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
