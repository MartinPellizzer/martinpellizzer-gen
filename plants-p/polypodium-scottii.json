    "intro": "Polypodium scottii, commonly known as the Scottish polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and northern England. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium scottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with humid conditions."
