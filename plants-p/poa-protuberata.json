    "intro": "Poa protuberata, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with short, stiff stems and small, tufted leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
