    "intro": "Ptilotus, commonly known as the \"desert lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiky, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ptilotus species are often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
