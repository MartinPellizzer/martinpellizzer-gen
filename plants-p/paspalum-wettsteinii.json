    "intro": "Paspalum wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
