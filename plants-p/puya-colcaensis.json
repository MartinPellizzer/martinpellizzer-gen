    "intro": "Puya colcaensis, commonly known as the Colca puya, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Puya colcaensis is considered a botanical marvel and a symbol of the Andean landscape."
