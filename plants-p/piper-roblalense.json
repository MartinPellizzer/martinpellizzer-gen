    "intro": "Piper roblalense, commonly known as the Roblalense pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland regions of countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often require support for growth. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit, which is a small, three-lobed berry, is typically harvested when it turns dark purple, and it is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
