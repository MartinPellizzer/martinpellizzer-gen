    "intro": "Perityle lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf perityle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Perityle lobata typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
