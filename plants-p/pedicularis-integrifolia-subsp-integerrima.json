    "intro": "Pedicularis integrifolia subsp. integerrima, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is perennial and typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has lance-shaped leaves that are entire and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
