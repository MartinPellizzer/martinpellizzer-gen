    "intro": "Pilosella xilocae, commonly known as the Mexican goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, creating a delicate, daisy-like appearance. Pilosella xilocae typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage is hairy, giving it a distinctive, soft texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments."
