    "intro": "Pitcairnia woronowii, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that form a rosette, creating a striking visual contrast with its vibrant orange flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are followed by the production of numerous small, greenish-white berries. Pitcairnia woronowii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
