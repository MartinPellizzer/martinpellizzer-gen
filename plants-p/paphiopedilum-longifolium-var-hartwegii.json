    "intro": "Paphiopedilum longifolium var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's lady's slipper, is a rare and exotic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to botanical gardens and collections. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
