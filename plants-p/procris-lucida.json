    "intro": "Procris lucida, commonly known as the bright-eyed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinct yellow and green coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Procris lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
