    "intro": "Pteris longipinnula, commonly known as the long-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into numerous slender pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its spread and anchoring in soil. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, though this trait is more commonly observed in related species."
