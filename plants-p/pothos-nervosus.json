    "intro": "Pothos nervosus, commonly known as the Variegated Pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often display striking variegation of green, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and is highly adaptable to a variety of indoor environments. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves. The foliage is not only ornamental but also capable of purifying the air, adding to its appeal as a houseplant."
