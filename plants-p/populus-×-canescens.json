    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 canescens, commonly known as the white poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, stream banks, and other wetland areas. Populus \u00d7 canescens is also valued for its fast growth and historical use in traditional medicine."
