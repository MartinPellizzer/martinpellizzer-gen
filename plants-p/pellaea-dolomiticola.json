    "intro": "Pellaea dolomiticola, commonly known as the Dolomite maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Dolomites of northern Italy. It thrives in calcareous, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has delicate, intricately veined fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns, with a distinctive upright growth habit. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
