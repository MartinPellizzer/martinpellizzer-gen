    "intro": "Polypodium trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad fern, is a species of polypody that is native to the Caribbean region, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid climates. The fronds are usually divided into small, linear segments, giving it a distinctive appearance."
