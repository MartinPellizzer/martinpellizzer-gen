    "intro": "Pteris erosa, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris erosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
