    "intro": "Puya trollii, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height, bearing numerous vibrant purple and red flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean mountains. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure. Puya trollii is a slow-growing plant that blooms only once in its lifetime, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
