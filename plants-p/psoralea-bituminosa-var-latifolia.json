    "intro": "Psoralea bituminosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems and small, pinnately compound leaves with numerous leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
