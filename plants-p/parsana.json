    "intro": "Parsana, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica ferox*, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Parsana produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Urticaceae family."
