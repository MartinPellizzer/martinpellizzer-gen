It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance."
