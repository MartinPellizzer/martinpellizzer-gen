    "intro": "Pitcairnia fulgens, commonly known as the fiery torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that surround its inflorescence, which resembles a torch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its rosette-shaped leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pitcairnia fulgens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
