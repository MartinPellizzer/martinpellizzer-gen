    "intro": "Pourouma tergoscabra, commonly known as the \"brazil nut tree,\" is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Palmae and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits containing up to 20 seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are encased in a hard, fibrous shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly oils and proteins. The plant plays a vital ecological role in its habitat, supporting a wide range of wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest."
