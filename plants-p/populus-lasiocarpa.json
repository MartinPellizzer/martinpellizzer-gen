    "intro": "Populus lasiocarpa, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, scaly, and often whitish in color, providing protection against wildfires and extreme temperatures. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and arranged in spirals along the branches. Populus lasiocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude environments."
