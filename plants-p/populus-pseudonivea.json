    "intro": "Populus pseudonivea, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine, white down. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots can spread widely, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
