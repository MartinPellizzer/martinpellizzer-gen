It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are relatively small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
