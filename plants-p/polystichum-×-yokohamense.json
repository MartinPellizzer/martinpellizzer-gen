    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 yokohamense, commonly known as the Yokohama shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum munitum. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
