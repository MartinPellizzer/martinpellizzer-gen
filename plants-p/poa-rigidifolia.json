    "intro": "Poa rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ability to colonize rocky soils, Poa rigidifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
