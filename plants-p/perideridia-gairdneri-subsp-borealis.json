It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coniferous forests and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that helps it survive in cooler climates. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences."
