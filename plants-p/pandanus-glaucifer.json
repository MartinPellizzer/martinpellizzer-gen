    "intro": "Pandanus glaucifer, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spiky inflorescence, which eventually develop into edible, fleshy berries. Its roots are also used in some local medicinal practices. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
