    "intro": "Phyllocladus serratifolius, commonly known as the serrated phyllocladus, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves due to their structure. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its foliage is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low nutrient soils. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
