    "intro": "Parahebe, commonly known as the New Zealand hebe, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. These plants are typically shrubs with lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. They are often found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Parahebe species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, cool conditions. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to New Zealand's native ecosystems."
