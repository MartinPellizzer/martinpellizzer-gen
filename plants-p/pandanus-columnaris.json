    "intro": "Pandanus columnaris, commonly known as the bottle palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into fibrous, banana-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Pandanus columnaris thrives in humid, coastal environments and is well adapted to saline conditions."
