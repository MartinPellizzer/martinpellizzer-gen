    "intro": "Pleurothallis, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of orchids native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It comprises over 1,000 species, many of which are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. The plants typically have small, intricate flowers with vibrant colors, often resembling spiders due to their unique shape. They require high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts. Their specialized root systems allow them to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
