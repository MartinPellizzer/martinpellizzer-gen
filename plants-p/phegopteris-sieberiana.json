    "intro": "Phegopteris sieberiana, commonly known as the Sieber's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
