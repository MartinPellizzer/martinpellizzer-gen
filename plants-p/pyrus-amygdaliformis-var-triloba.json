    "intro": "Pyrus amygdaliformis var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed pear, is a rare and ornamental variant of the pear tree. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble a three-leaf clover. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
