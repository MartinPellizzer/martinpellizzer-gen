It features a compact, low-growing habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often with a distinctive crown-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
