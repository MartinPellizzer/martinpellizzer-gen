    "intro": "Pitcairnia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia suaveolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
