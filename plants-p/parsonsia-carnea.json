    "intro": "Parsonsia carnea, commonly known as the pink flame tree, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range from pink to red, often with a yellow throat, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Parsonsia carnea thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
