    "intro": "Pothomorphe umbellata var. vestita, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant prefers well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
