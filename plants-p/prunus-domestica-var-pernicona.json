This variety is a type of European plum characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically smaller than standard plums. The plant is deciduous, producing small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits. The flowers are pink and appear in early spring, preceding the development of the fruit."
