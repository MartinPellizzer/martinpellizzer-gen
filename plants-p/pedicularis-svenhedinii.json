    "intro": "Pedicularis svenhedinii, commonly known as the Svenhedin's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on its host for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in association with coniferous trees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
