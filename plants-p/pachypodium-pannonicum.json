    "intro": "Pachypodium pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to the semi-arid regions of Hungary and Croatia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Pachypodium pannonicum is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
