    "intro": "Potentilla radicosa var. nuda, commonly known as the naked-stem potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically features wiry, upright stems that are often leafless or nearly so, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Potentilla radicosa var. nuda is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
