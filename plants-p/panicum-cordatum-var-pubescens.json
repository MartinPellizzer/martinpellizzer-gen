It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clumps or tufts. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its characteristic \"hairy\" appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, fluffy panicles, which are often wind-dispersed. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites."
