    "intro": "Poa macrocalyx var. scabriflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets with rough, bristly lemmas, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
