    "intro": "Populus yunnanensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar with small leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Populus yunnanensis, often measuring up to 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically yellowish-green and appear in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
