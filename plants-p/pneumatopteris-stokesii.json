    "intro": "Pneumatopteris stokesii, commonly known as the Stokes' water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually finely divided and possess a feathery appearance, which aids in maximizing light absorption. Pneumatopteris stokesii plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
