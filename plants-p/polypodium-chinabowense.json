    "intro": "Polypodium chinabowense, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the underside of the fronds. Polypodium chinabowense is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
