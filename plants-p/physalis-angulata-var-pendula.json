    "intro": "Physalis angulata var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping gooseberry, is a variant of the common physalis characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. It produces bright red, lantern-like fruits that encase the seeds, a feature typical of the genus Physalis. The plant is native to the Americas and thrives in moist, sunny environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique and attractive fruiting structures."
