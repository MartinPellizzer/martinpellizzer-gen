    "intro": "Poterium tineoi, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that form a rosette-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
