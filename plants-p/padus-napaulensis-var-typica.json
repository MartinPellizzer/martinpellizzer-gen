    "intro": "Padus napaulensis var. typica, commonly known as the Nepal maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Aceraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
