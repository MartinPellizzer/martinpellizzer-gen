It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces dense, fluffy seed heads that are often white or pale in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery sheen that enhances its ornamental appeal.
