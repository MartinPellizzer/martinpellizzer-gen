    "intro": "Plantago winteri, commonly known as the Alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded mountain environments."
