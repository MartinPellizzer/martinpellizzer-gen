    "intro": "Panicum remotum, commonly known as eastern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feather-like foliage that gives it a soft, airy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to golden brown spikelets that mature into fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Panicum remotum is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for pollinators and its low maintenance requirements."
