    "intro": "Psoralea bituminosa subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and forest edges. It is a perennial herb that produces small, lens-shaped pods containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
