    "intro": "Polystichum pycnolepis, commonly known as the dense-ferns rock brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, rusty-brown tomentum. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, forming dense mats or clumps. Its fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a distinctive, narrow, and upright growth habit. Polystichum pycnolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
