It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, containing the alkaloid piperine, which contributes to its spicy flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and vine-like. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
