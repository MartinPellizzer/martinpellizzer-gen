    "intro": "Paraderris lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features delicate, feathery foliage with finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
