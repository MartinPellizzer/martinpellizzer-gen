    "intro": "Populus croatica, commonly known as the Croatian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Populus croatica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and lakes. Its wood is lightweight and has been used historically for various crafts and construction purposes."
