It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
