    "intro": "Puya wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red or orange flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, allowing it to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. Its unique growth pattern and vibrant floral display make it a popular subject in botanical gardens. Puya wrightii is also notable for its ability to survive extreme weather conditions, including frost and strong winds."
