    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. besseriana, commonly known as the Alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green foliage and small, yellowish flower heads. This subspecies is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize open, disturbed habitats. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often seen in mountainous areas of Europe and western Asia."
