    "intro": "Pandanus labyrinthicus, commonly known as the labyrinth pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it an important plant in coastal ecosystems. The fruit, which is a fibrous husk enclosing a hard seed, is not typically consumed by humans but plays a role in seed dispersal by birds and other wildlife."
