    "intro": "Prunus tenuiflora, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small yellow or orange drupe, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Prunus tenuiflora is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
