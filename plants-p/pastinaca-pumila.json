    "intro": "Pastinaca pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bur marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pastinaca pumila is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
