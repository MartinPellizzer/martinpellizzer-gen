    "intro": "[WRONG START] Phalaris glomerata, commonly known as tufted grass or spike grass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Phalaris glomerata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
