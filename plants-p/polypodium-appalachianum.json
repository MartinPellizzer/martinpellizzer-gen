    "intro": "Polypodium appalachianum, commonly known as the Appalachian cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
