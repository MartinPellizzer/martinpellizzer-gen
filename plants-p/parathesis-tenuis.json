It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Parathesis tenuis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
