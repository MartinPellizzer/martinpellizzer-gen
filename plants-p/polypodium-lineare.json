    "intro": "Polypodium lineare, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, strap-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and temperate forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
