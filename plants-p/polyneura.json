    "intro": "Polyneura, commonly known as the coastal greenbrier, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. Polyneura thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, saline environments."
