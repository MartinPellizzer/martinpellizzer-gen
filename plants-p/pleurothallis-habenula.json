    "intro": "Pleurothallis habenula, commonly known as the blue-veined orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a striking blue or purple hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle yet elegant presence to its environment."
