    "intro": "Picea tonaiensis, commonly known as the Tonai spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Picea tonaiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
