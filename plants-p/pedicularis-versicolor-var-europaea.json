    "intro": "Pedicularis versicolor var. europaea, commonly known as the European spotted winter orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with yellow markings, and it blooms from late winter to early spring. This rare species is found in parts of Europe and is often associated with specific host plants like Betula and Pinus."
