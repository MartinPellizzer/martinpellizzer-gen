    "intro": "Polypodium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-part) fronds that are typically divided into three narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are also valued for their ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
