    "intro": "Pilosperma, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Pilosperma is typically found growing in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
