    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed Japanese cherry, is a distinctive cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to typical cherry trees. The plant produces showy, single pink flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates. The foliage turns a vibrant red in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal."
