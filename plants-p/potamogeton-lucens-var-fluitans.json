    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged, with the tips often extending to the water's surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually found near the water's edge. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished by its floating growth habit, which sets it apart from other varieties of Potamogeton."
