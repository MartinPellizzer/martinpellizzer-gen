    "intro": "Pseudobaccharis nervosa, commonly known as narrow-veined false holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Pseudobaccharis nervosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
