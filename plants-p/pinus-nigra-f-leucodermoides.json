    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. leucodermoides, commonly known as the white bark pine, is a unique variant of the black pine species. It is characterized by its distinctive white or light-colored bark, which contrasts with the typical dark bark of its parent species. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain populations of Pinus nigra, primarily in southern Europe. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, typical of the pine family, and it produces cones that mature over several years. This ornamental and rare form is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
