    "intro": "Polypodium capense, commonly known as the Cape polypody, is a fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows."
