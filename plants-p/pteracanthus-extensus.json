    "intro": "Pteracanthus extensus, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Pteracanthus extensus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
