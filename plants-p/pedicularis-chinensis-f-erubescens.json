    "intro": "Pedicularis chinensis f. erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
