    "intro": "Pendulina, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that hang from the stems, often displaying vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. The plants typically grow in moist, temperate climates and are often found in woodland or meadow environments. Pendulina species have hairy leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. These botanical features make Pendulina an attractive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
