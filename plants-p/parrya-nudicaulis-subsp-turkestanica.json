    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis subsp. turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
