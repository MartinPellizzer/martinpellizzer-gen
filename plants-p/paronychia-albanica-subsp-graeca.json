It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny stems, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
