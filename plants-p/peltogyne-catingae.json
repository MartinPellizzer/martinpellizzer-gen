    "intro": "Peltogyne catingae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry forest ecosystems. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
