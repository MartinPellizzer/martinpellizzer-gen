    "intro": "Pinus densata subsp. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan dense pine, is a subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and robust, conical shape. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its cones are typically small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native ecosystem."
