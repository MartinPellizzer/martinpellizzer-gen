    "intro": "Phreatia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phreatia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces pendant, yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them. Phreatia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
