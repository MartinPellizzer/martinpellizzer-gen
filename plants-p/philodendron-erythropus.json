    "intro": "Philodendron erythropus, commonly known as the red-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with striking red veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Its ornamental value makes it a popular houseplant, though it is toxic to pets and humans if ingested."
