    "intro": "Prunus tinctoria, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Prunus tinctoria is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
