    "intro": "Portulaca gagatosperma, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow to orange flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Portulaca gagatosperma is well adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
