    "intro": "Pitcairnia oxapampae, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Andes,\" is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its large, spathaceous inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads in the world. The plant's leaves form a rosette that collects water, which is used by various species of hummingbirds and insects. Its vibrant red flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Pitcairnia oxapampae is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
