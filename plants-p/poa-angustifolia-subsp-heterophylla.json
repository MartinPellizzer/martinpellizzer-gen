    "intro": "Poa angustifolia subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf poa with variable foliage, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that vary in width and shape depending on environmental conditions. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awned florets. The plant is relatively low-growing and has a clump-forming habit, making it a subtle yet distinctive component of its native habitat."
