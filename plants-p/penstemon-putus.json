    "intro": "Penstemon putus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon putus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
