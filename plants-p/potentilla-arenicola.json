    "intro": "Potentilla arenicola, commonly known as the sandwort potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Potentilla arenicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes."
