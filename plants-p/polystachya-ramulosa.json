It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
