It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It produces sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
