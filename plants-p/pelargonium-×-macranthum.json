    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a hybrid species within the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red and white, often with contrasting centers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with rounded, velvety leaves that have a distinctive serrated edge. Native to South Africa, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early autumn."
