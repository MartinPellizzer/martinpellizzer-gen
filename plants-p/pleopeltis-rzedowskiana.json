    "intro": "Pleopeltis rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowska's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact growth habit with short, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate leaves. It is typically found in cloud forests at high elevations, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
