    "intro": "Psammophila confertifolia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and succulent stems, which store water. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry shrublands. Its botanical features make it a resilient species well-suited to extreme desert conditions."
