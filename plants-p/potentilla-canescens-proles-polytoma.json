    "intro": "Potentilla canescens proles polytoma, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its stems are often woody and branched, with a creeping or upright growth habit depending on the species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to poor soil conditions."
