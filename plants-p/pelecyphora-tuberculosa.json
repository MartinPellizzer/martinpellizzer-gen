    "intro": "Pelecyphora tuberculosa, commonly known as the warty pelecyphora, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, tuberous roots that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are succulent and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss. Pelecyphora tuberculosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
