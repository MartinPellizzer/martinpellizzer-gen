    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 kawashiroi, commonly known as the Kawashiro apple, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyrifolia (Chinese white pear) and Pyrus betulaefolia (Japanese white pear). It is native to Japan and is characterized by its small, sweet, and aromatic fruits. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is usually harvested in late summer and is prized for its flavor and use in traditional Japanese cuisine."
