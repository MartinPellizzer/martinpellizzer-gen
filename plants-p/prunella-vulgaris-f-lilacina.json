    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered selfheal, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves that are typically hairy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple or lilac, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced lilac hue compared to the typical blue or purple flowers of the species."
