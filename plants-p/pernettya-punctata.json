    "intro": "Pernettya punctata, commonly known as the spotted cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Pernettya punctata is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems."
