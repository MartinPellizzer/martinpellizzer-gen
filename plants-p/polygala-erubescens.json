    "intro": "Polygala erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees and wasps. Polygala erubescens is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open woodland and grassland habitats."
