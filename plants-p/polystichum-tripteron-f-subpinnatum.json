    "intro": "Polystichum tripteron f. subpinnatum, commonly known as the subpinnate wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond structure. It features a tall, slender rhizome with bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. This fern is native to regions with temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
