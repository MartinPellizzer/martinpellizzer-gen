It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
