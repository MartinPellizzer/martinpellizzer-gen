It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical research and local horticulture."
