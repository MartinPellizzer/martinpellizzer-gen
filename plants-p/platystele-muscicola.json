    "intro": "Platystele muscicola, commonly known as the mossy ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble moss. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
