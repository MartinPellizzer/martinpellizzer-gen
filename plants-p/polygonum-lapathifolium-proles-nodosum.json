    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium proles nodosum, commonly known as the nodding knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture and are often arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
