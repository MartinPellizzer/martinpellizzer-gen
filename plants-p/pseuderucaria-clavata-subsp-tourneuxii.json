    "intro": "Pseuderucaria clavata subsp. tourneuxii, commonly known as the Tourneux's clubmoss, is a rare and specialized member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, clustered arrangement of sporophylls. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
