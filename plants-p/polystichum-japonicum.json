    "intro": "Polystichum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
