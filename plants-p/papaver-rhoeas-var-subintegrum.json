It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and open fields. The flowers are large, showy, and bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a yellowish central disk. The plant has a taproot system and produces capsule fruits that release seeds when mature.
