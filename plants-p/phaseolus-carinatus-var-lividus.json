    "intro": "Phaseolus carinatus var. lividus, commonly known as the Andean bean or the lupin bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ridged seed pods and small, bean-like seeds that are typically beige or brown in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as it is rich in protein and dietary fiber. Its botanical features include compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a flowering pattern that produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. This variety is also valued for its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its role in traditional Andean agriculture."
