    "intro": "Pilea henryana, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its round, shield-shaped leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea henryana is a compact, evergreen perennial that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
