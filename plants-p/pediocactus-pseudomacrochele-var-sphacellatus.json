    "intro": "Pediocactus pseudomacrochele var. sphacellatus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered cactus species."
