    "intro": "Peucedanum dinteri, commonly known as Dinter's angelica, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Ethiopian Highlands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a strong, spicy scent, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex umbels. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
