    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved pear, is a variant of the common pear species. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the typical pear. It is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in horticulture."
