    "intro": "Plexipus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf plexipus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in drier conditions. Plexipus pumilus is often found in woodland edges and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
