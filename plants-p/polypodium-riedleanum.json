    "intro": "Polypodium riedleanum, commonly known as the Riedel's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
