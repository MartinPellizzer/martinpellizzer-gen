    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 arnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Asian pear). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 4\u20138 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, juicy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is usually small to medium in size, with a crisp texture and a sweet to subacid flavor. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for both its foliage and fruit."
