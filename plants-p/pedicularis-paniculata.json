    "intro": "Pedicularis paniculata, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. This species is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small monkeys, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system."
