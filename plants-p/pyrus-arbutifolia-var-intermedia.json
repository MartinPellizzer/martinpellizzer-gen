    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen in the fall. Its botanical features include a rough, flaky bark and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to wildlife."
