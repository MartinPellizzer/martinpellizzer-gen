    "intro": "Phlomis dszumrutensis, commonly known as the Dzumrut mountain phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal and culinary uses. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, grayish-white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat in remote, high-altitude environments, it is relatively rare and has limited distribution."
