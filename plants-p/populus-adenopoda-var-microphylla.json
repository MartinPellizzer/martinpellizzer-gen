    "intro": "Populus adenopoda var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The bark of this species is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. This plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and shrublands."
