    "intro": "Podocarpus rostratus var. perrieri, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a member of the Podocarpaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic resinous scent. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian forests."
