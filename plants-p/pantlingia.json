It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in complex inflorescences. Pantlingia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
