    "intro": "Polypodium retusum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and lanceolate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Polypodium retusum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings."
