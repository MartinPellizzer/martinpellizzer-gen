    "intro": "Pyrus rubens, commonly known as the red crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, and its fruit, which is typically a small, tart apple. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in hybridization to develop new apple varieties."
