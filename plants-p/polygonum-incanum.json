    "intro": "Polygonum incanum, commonly known as the grey foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
