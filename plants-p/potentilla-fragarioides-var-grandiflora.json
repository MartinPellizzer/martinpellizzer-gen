It features compound leaves with five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces showy, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
