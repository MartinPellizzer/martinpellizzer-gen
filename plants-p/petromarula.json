    "intro": "Petromarula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Petromarula is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species adapted to coastal environments."
