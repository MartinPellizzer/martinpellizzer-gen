    "intro": "Pleuranthodium racemigerum, commonly known as the clustered pleuranthodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
