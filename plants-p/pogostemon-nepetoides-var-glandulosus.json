    "intro": "Pogostemon nepetoides var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular pogostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in whorls, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems contribute to its distinctive appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions."
