    "intro": "Poa calliopsis var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in open, sunny habitats."
