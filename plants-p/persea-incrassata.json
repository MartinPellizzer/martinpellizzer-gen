    "intro": "Persea incrassata, commonly known as the rough-leaf spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. Its bark is rough and fissured, and the tree can grow up to 15 meters in height. Persea incrassata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
