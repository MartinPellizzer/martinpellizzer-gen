    "intro": "Paphiopedilum affine, commonly known as the common lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a deep red or purple lip, and it produces small, greenish-white leaves. Paphiopedilum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
