    "intro": "Pedicularis pectinata var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to rose-red flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
