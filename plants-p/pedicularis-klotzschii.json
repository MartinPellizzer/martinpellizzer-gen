    "intro": "Pedicularis klotzschii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are tubular and often have a spurred structure at the base, a feature common in the genus Pedicularis. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system."
