    "intro": "Phoenicanthemum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive red or pink flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to dry conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, and the flowers are clustered in racemes, adding to its ornamental value. Phoenicanthemum species are also valued for their timber, which is highly prized for its durability and rich color."
