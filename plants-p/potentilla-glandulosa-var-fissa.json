    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. fissa, commonly known as the fringed cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically divided into five oval-shaped lobes, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for arid environments."
