    "intro": "Psidium popenoei, commonly known as the Hawaiian guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries similar to guavas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
