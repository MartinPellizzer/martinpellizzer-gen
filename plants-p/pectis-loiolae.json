    "intro": "Pectis loiolae, commonly known as the yellow pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pectis loiolae is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
