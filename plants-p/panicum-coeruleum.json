    "intro": "Panicum coeruleum, commonly known as blue panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with a bluish tinge, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a landscape plant. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, Panicum coeruleum is a popular choice for native plant gardens and naturalized areas."
