    "intro": "Primula vulgaris f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a variant of the common primrose characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and a showy, rounded shape. The hairy texture of its leaves is due to the presence of fine, soft hairs covering the surface. It is a perennial plant that produces showy blooms in early spring."
