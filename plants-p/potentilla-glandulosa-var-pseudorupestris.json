    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. pseudorupestris, commonly known as the rough potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its stems are often branched and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
