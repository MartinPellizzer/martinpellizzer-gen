    "intro": "Poa supina subsp. ustulata, commonly known as the bentgrass or cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a groundcover in landscaping."
