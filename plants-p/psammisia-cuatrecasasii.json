    "intro": "Psammisia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological role in desert ecosystems make it an important species for botanical study."
