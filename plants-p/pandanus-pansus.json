    "intro": "Pandanus pansus, commonly known as the Hawaiian pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, which eventually develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Pandanus pansus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline. Its unique appearance and cultural significance make it an important species in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
