    "intro": "Poterium vulgare, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
