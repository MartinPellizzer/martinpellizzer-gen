    "intro": "Pilosocereus tillianus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that are often adorned with soft, velvety spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This popular ornamental plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance requirements."
