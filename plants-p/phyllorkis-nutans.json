    "intro": "Phyllorkis nutans, commonly known as the drooping phyllorkis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
