    "intro": "Pleione forrestii var. alba, commonly known as the white pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in mossy areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical collections."
