    "intro": "Pterocephalus laxus, commonly known as the Chinese poppy, is a flowering plant native to China and neighboring regions. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive crown-like shape. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its medicinal properties. Its seeds are used in traditional Chinese medicine, and the plant has also been cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, due to its association with opium production, it is regulated in many countries."
