    "intro": "Paris tetraphylla f. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved wood sorrel, is a rare and endangered fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves with sessile (stemless) leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
