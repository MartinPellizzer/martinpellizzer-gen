    "intro": "Plantago major proles intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features broad, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is characterized by its intermediate traits between the common plantain and the narrow-leafed proles intermedia. This species is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
