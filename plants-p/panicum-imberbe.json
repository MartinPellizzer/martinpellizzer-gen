    "intro": "Panicum imberbe, commonly known as hairless panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
