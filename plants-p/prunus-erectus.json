    "intro": "Prunus erectus, commonly known as the upright cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with smooth, gray bark and a preference for well-drained soils. Prunus erectus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
