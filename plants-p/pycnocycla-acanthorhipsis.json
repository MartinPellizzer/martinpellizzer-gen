    "intro": "Pycnocycla acanthorhipsis, commonly known as the roughleaf pycnocycla, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its leaves are typically rough to the touch, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Pycnocycla acanthorhippis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
