    "intro": "Pilosella glaucochroa, commonly known as the blue-green pilosella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Pilosella glaucochroa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
