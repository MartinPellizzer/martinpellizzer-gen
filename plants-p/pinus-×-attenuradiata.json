It is a tall evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of its parent species. The tree produces cones that are often larger and more elongated compared to its progenitors. It is native to the central and northern regions of North America, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. This hybrid is valued for its adaptability and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience."
