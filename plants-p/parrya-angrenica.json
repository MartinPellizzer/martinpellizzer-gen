    "intro": "Parrya angrenica, commonly known as the Karakoram bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parrya angrenica is a hardy perennial that plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous environment."
