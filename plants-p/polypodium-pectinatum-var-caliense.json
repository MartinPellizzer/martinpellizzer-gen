    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. caliense, commonly known as the Caliense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps protect the plant from excessive moisture loss in its natural habitat."
