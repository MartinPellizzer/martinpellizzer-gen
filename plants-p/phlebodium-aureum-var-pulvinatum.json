    "intro": "Phlebodium aureum var. pulvinatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fiddlehead-like fronds that are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
