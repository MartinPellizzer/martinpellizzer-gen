    "intro": "Poa adusta, commonly known as the dark red grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark reddish-brown foliage, which gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa adusta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its unique color and texture."
