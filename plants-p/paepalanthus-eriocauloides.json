    "intro": "Paepalanthus eriocauloides, commonly known as the woolly pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by soft, hairy bracts. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
