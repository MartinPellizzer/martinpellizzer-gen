    "intro": "Pilocereus crenulatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a rounded, segmented stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
