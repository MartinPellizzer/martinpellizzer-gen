    "intro": "Polypodium fontanum, commonly known as the Fontana fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often form a rosette. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. Its spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium fontanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
