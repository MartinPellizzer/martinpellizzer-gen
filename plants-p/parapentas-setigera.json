    "intro": "Parapentas setigera, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that resemble a zigzag pattern. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Parapentas setigera is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
