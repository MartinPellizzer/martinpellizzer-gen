    "intro": "Physalis turbinatoides, commonly known as the red balloon vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose the fruit, which turns bright red when mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the vine. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are trailing or climbing. The fruit is edible and often used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly cultivated for its ornamental value."
