    "intro": "Phoradendron pseudomucronatum, commonly known as the false holly or mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of trees in the genus *Ficus*. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
