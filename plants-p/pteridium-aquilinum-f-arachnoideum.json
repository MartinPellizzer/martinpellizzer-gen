    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum f. arachnoideum, commonly known as the silky bracken, is a fern characterized by its distinctive, finely hairy fronds. This fern is a variant of the common bracken, distinguished by its dense, silky hairs that cover the fronds, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The fronds are bipinnate, with a long, narrow stalk and a broad, feather-like structure. This fern is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants."
