    "intro": "Pittosporum letocartiorum, commonly known as the Titi fern tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly used in horticulture outside its native range."
