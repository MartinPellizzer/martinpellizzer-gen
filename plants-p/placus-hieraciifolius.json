    "intro": "Placus hieraciifolius, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
