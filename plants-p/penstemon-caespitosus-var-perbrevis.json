    "intro": "Penstemon caespitosus var. perbrevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, branched stems and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and attractive floral display."
