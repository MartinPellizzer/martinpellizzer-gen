    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a variant of the Scots pine that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation along sandy or rocky shores. Its roots are adapted to withstand salt spray and poor soil conditions, making it resilient in coastal ecosystems. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in maritime regions."
