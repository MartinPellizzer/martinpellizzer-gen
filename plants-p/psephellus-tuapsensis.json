    "intro": "Psephellus tuapsensis, commonly known as the Tuapsen rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
