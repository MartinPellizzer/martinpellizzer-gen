    "intro": "Plagiolobium chorizemifolium var. subintegrum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its nearly entire leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties within the species."
