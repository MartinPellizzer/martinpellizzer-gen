    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa var. penduliformis, commonly known as the hanging or weeping ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine characterized by its distinctive weeping growth habit. This variety exhibits elongated, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, setting it apart from the upright form of the typical ponderosa pine. Botanically, it retains the needle-like foliage typical of the species, with long, slender leaves arranged in clusters. The cones are similar to those of the standard ponderosa pine, featuring thick, woody scales. It is typically found in higher elevations where it thrives in cooler, moist environments."
