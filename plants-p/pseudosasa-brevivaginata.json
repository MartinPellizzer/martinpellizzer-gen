    "intro": "Pseudosasa brevivaginata, commonly known as the short-sheath bamboo, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in forested areas and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its culms (stems) are hollow and jointed, typical of the grass family, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
