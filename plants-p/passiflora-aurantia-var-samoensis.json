It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that feature a unique blend of red, yellow, and orange hues, with prominent stamens and a crown of filaments. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm, humid climates."
