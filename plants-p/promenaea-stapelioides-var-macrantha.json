    "intro": "Promenaea stapelioides var. macrantha, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically green and cylindrical, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
