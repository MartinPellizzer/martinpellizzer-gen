    "intro": "Potamogeton sachalinensis, commonly known as Sachalin watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Asia. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often found near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
