    "intro": "Polygonum patuliforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense colonies. The plant features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pink to red flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Polygonum patuliforme is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
