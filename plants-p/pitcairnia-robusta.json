    "intro": "Pitcairnia robusta, commonly known as the robust pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Pitcairnia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
