    "intro": "Piptatherum obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained to moderately wet conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often wider than long. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spikelet, which bears small, spike-like flowers. Piptatherum obtusum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
