    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. ochichima, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus genus, characterized by its distinct white blooms. This form is a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus \u00d7 yedoensis, resulting in a unique genetic combination. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and a glossy green surface, while the flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom in early spring. The fruit is a small, sweet drupe, though it is not typically cultivated for its edibility."
