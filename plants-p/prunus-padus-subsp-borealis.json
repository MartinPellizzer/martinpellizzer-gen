    "intro": "Prunus padus subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its slender branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along riverbanks."
