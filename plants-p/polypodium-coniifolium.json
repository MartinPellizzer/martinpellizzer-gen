    "intro": "Polypodium coniifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds with a distinctive, often lobed shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
