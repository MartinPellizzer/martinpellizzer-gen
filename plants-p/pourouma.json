    "intro": "Pourouma, commonly known as the \"carnivorous palm,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its unique ability to trap and digest insects, similar to other carnivorous plants. The plant's leaves are often modified into structures that can ensnare prey, while its roots absorb nutrients from the soil. Pourouma species are typically found in wet, tropical environments where they thrive in nutrient-poor soils. These plants play a role in local ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of their habitats."
