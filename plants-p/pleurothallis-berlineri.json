    "intro": "Pleurothallis berlineri, commonly known as the Berliner's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
