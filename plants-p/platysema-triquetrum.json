    "intro": "Platysema triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive three-angled stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and often clustered in dense inflorescences. Platysema triquetrum is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
