    "intro": "Pteris apicalis, commonly known as the spike fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spiky structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Pteris apicalis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
