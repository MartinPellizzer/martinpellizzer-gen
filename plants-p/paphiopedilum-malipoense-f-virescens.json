    "intro": "Paphiopedilum malipoense f. virescens, commonly known as the Malipo green-flowered orchid, is a rare and unique hybrid within the Paphiopedilum genus. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often greenish-yellow floral lip, which distinguishes it from other members of the species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat in southern China. Its leaves are usually broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This cultivar is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its distinctive appearance and limited availability."
