    "intro": "Panicum lachneum, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray, silky hairs that cover its leaves and seed heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often loosely arranged. Panicum lachneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
