    "intro": "Potentilla detommasii, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It has basal leaves that are palmately divided, and its stems are often covered with fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
