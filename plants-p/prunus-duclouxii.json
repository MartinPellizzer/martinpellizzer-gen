    "intro": "Prunus duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild winters. Prunus duclouxii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in botanical gardens."
