    "intro": "Phelypaea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Phelypaea rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
