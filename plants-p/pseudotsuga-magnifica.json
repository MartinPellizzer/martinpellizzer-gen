    "intro": "Pseudotsuga magnifica, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular shape and long, flat needles that are blue-green in color. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing the seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against forest fires. The Douglas fir is valued for its durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
