    "intro": "Philodendron atratum, commonly known as the Black Velvet Philodendron, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy texture. This plant is a climbing species, often found growing along trees or supports in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
