    "intro": "Pernettya insana, commonly known as the mad cowberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red, edible berries. Pernettya insana is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in woodland or heathland environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
