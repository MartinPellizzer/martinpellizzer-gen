    "intro": "Pasaccardoa procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pasaccardoa, is a rare and delicate fungal species belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, yellowish to ochraceous cap and a fibrous, pale yellow stem. This mushroom typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in decaying wood or on the forest floor. Its spore production occurs in the form of a distinct, sticky gelatinous mass on the cap surface. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
