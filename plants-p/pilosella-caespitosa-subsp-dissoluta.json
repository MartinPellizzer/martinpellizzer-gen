    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa subsp. dissoluta, commonly known as the tufted cat's-paw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lobed or dissected, while the upper leaves are more narrow and grass-like. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and gravelly soils. Pilosella caespitosa subsp. dissoluta is often found in temperate climates and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
