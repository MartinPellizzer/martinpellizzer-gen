    "intro": "Polypodium percrassum, commonly known as the broad-leaf cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
