    "intro": "Peristeria stapelioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its thick, fleshy stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling small ghosts, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
