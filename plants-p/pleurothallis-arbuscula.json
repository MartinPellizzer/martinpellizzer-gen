    "intro": "Pleurothallis arbuscula, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Pleurothallis arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
