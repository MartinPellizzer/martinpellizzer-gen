    "intro": "Panicum incanum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a flowering plant native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a grass-like perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to brownish flowers, which are often mistaken for seed heads. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a powdery, whitish coating, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Panicum incanum is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, drought-tolerant foliage and low maintenance requirements."
