    "intro": "Polypodium bryophyllum, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a tropical epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and small, kidney-shaped spore cases. It produces spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
