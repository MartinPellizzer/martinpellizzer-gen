    "intro": "Physaria humilis, commonly known as the common bladderpod, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a unique, inflated pod that splits open to release seeds, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. Physaria humilis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
