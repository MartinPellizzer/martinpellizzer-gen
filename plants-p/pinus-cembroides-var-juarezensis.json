    "intro": "Pinus cembroides var. juarezensis, commonly known as the Mexican Apache pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically 4 to 6 inches long and have a bluish-green color. The cones of this plant are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening to release seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. The tree can reach heights of up to 50 feet and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species in its native habitat."
