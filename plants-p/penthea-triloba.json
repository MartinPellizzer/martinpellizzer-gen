    "intro": "Penthea triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed penthea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
