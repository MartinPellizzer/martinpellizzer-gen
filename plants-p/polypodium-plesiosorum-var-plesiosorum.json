    "intro": "Polypodium plesiosorum var. plesiosorum, commonly known as the plesiosorus fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct rows."
