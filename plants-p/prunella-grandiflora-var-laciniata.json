    "intro": "Prunella grandiflora var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved selfheal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
