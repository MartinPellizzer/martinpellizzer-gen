    "intro": "Polypteris texana, commonly known as the Texas water fern, is a member of the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polypteris texana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties."
