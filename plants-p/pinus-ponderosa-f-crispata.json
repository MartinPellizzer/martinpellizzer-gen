    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa f. crispata, commonly known as the ponderosa pine var. crispata, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped or curled foliage, which sets it apart from the typical smooth needles of the main species. The plant exhibits a tall, straight trunk with a broad, open crown, often reaching heights of over 50 meters. Its cones are usually pendulous and contain edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
