    "intro": "Polygonum maritimum var. roberti, commonly known as the coastal knotweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense colonies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments. This variant is adapted to sandy or muddy shores, demonstrating resilience to salt spray and tidal fluctuations."
