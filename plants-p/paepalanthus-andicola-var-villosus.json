    "intro": "Paepalanthus andicola var. villosus, commonly known as the Andean hairy cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
