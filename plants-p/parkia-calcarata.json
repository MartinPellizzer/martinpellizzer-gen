    "intro": "Parkia calcarata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has compound leaves and produces yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
