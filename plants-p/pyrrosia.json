    "intro": "Pyrrosia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, leathery leaves that often form dense mats on rocks or tree trunks. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pyrrosia species typically have a rhizome that anchors them to their substrate and produces spore-bearing structures called sori. Their unique growth habits and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions make them an important component of forest ecosystems."
