    "intro": "Polystichum dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
