    "intro": "Pluchea paniculata var. subsimplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fluffy, white seeds. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
