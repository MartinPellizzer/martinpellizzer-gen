    "intro": "Populus deltoides f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy balsam poplar, is a variant of the balsam poplar native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often grayish-white in color, distinguishing it from other Populus species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riparian ecosystems."
