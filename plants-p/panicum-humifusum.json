    "intro": "Panicum humifusum, commonly known as prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to North America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in disturbed or sandy soils. The plant has slender, hairy stems that lie close to the soil surface, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
