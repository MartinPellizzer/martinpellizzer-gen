It features fine, silver-gray leaves that curl inward, creating a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces delicate, feathery flower spikes that add visual interest in the late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
