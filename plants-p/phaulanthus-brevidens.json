It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Phaulanthus brevidens is typically found in desert scrub habitats and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
