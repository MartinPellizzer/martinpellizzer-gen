    "intro": "Pycnarrhena mecistophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are slender and often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
