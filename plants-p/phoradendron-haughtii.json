    "intro": "Phoradendron haughtii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pseudocarapa*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves and white or pink flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays an ecological role in providing food for certain bird species and can influence the health of its host tree. Its presence is often associated with specific forest ecosystems in Central and South America."
