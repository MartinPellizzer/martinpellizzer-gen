    "intro": "Philodendron cerrojefense, commonly known as the Cerro Jefense Philodendron, is a rare and unique species native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a slight sheen, making it visually distinctive. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
