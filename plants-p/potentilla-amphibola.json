It is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and other water bodies. Potentilla amphibola plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
