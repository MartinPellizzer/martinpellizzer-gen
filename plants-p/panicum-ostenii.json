    "intro": "Panicum ostenii, commonly known as the Osten's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often seen in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil in such areas. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
