    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. conferta, commonly known as the bluegrass clover, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
