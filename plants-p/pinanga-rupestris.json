    "intro": "Pinanga rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender rhizome and its pinnate, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Pinanga rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
