    "intro": "Pseudobombax cajamarcanus, commonly known as the Andean ceiba, is a deciduous tree native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a buttressed trunk and a broad, spreading canopy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a cottony fluff, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
