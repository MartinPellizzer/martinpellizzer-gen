    "intro": "Pelecyphora strobiliformis, commonly known as the starry bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a star-like arrangement, giving it its common name. Pelecyphora strobiliformis is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through prey capture."
