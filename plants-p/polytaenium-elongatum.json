    "intro": "Polytaenium elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water plant, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features long, slender stems that can grow several meters in length, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, helping it to spread across the water's surface. It is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
