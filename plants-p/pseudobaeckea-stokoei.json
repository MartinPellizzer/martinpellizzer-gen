    "intro": "Pseudobaeckea stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's pseudobaeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
