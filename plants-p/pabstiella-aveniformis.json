    "intro": "Pabstiella aveniformis, commonly known as the sandhill milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a host plant for several species of native butterflies."
