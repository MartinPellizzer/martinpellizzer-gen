It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas, where it withstands high salinity and strong winds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique floral display."
