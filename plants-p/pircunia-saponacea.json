    "intro": "Pircunia saponacea, commonly known as the soap tree, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, soapy coating, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its sap is known for its foaming properties, which have been traditionally used in various indigenous practices. Pircunia saponacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for potential medicinal applications."
