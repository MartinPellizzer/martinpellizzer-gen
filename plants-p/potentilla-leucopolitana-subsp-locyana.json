    "intro": "Potentilla leucopolitana subsp. locyana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
