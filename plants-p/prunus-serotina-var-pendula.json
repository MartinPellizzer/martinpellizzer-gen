    "intro": "Prunus serotina var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn from green to black as they mature. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
