    "intro": "Passiflora chocoensis, commonly known as the Choco passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and yellow hues, with prominent filaments and a crown-like structure. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in nutrients and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite long. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
