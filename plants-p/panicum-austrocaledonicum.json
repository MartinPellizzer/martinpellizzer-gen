    "intro": "Panicum austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian panicgrass, is a grass species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
