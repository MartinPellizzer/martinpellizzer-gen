    "intro": "Paracephaelis capitulifera, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters called capitula. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Paracephaelis capitulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
