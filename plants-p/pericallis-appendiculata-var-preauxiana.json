    "intro": "Pericallis appendiculata var. preauxiana, commonly known as the Pseudostellaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
