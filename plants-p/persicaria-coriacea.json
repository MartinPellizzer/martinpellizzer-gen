    "intro": "Persicaria coriacea, commonly known as rough knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy and covered in small, rough-textured glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture, giving the plant its common name. Persicaria coriacea is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows."
