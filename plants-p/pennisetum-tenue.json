    "intro": "Pennisetum tenue, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that resembles a fountain. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, fluffy flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pennisetum tenue is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for birds and insects in the garden."
