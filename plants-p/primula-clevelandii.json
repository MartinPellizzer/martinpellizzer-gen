It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and has a short growing season, blooming in early spring. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
