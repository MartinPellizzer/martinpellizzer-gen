    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. mollior, commonly known as the soft-haired plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
