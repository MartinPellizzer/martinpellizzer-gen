    "intro": "Primula planiflora, commonly known as the flat-flowered primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and a distinctive corolla. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
