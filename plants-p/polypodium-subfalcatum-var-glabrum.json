    "intro": "Polypodium subfalcatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself to moist substrates. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
