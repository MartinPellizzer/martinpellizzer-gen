It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant has a thick, fleshy caudex that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in compact heads, and it blooms during the warmer months. Petastoma caudiculatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
