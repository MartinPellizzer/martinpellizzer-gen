    "intro": "Phyllanthus raiateaensis, commonly known as the Tahitian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and forested areas, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. It is adapted to tropical climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
