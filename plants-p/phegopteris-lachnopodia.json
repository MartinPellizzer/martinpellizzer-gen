    "intro": "Phegopteris lachnopodia, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Phegopteris lachnopodia has small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-damp habitat."
