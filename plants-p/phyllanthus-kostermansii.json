    "intro": "Phyllanthus kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and prefers well-drained soils in tropical climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
