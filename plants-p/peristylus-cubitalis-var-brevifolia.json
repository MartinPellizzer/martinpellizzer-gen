    "intro": "Peristylus cubitalis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved peristylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically no longer than 2 inches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
