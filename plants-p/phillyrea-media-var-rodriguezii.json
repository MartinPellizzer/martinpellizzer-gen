    "intro": "Phillyrea media var. rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez's Phillyrea, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and emit a mild, resinous scent. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
