    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. angulosa, commonly known as the Angulate Whitebark Pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebark pine. It is characterized by its unique, sharply angled bark that gives it its common name. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are short and stout, providing dense coverage. The tree is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living for several centuries in its native habitat."
