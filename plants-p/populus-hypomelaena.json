    "intro": "Populus hypomelaena, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The black poplar is often found near waterways and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
