    "intro": "Podophyllum hexandrum var. emodi, commonly known as Himalayan mayapple, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like cluster of heart-shaped leaves and its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Ayurvedic medicine."
