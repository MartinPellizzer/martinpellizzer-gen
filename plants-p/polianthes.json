    "intro": "Polianthes, commonly known as the spider lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southern United States, Mexico, and parts of Central America. The plant features tall, strap-shaped leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Polianthes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. They bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic touch to gardens and landscapes."
