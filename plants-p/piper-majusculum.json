It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It produces berries that mature to a bright red color, which are edible and have a peppery flavor. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
