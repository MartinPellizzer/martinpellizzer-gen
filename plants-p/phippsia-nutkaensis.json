    "intro": "Phippsia nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka's phippsia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of British Columbia, Canada. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the shoreline and is adapted to the harsh coastal climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
