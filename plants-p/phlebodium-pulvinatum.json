    "intro": "Phlebodium pulvinatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that form a rosette shape, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, short rhizome that anchors it to its host, typically trees in humid environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, curled appearance with a central groove. Phlebodium pulvinatum thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal."
