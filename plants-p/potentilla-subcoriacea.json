    "intro": "Potentilla subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Potentilla subcoriacea is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
