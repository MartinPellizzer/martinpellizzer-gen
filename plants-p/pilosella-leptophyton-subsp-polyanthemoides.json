It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, giving it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft, fluffy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
