    "intro": "Poa alpina var. jemtlandica, commonly known as the Jemtland alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass native to high-altitude regions of Scandinavia. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically forms dense mats with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain tundra. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
