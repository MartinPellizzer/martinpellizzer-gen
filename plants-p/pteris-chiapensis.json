    "intro": "Pteris chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Pteris chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
