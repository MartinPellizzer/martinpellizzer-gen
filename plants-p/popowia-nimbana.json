    "intro": "Popowia nimbana, commonly known as the sacred banyan, is a large, fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its extensive root system and aerial roots that form a dense canopy, creating a unique and sprawling structure. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by round, orange-red fruits. Popowia nimbana is often found near water sources and is valued for its shade and ecological importance in its native habitat."
