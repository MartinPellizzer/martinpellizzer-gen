It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
