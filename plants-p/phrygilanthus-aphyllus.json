    "intro": "Phrygilanthus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless flame tree, is a unique species characterized by its lack of leaves and distinctive floral display. Despite its name, it produces vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual impact. The plant is native to parts of Africa and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its structure consists of woody stems with modified branches that bear the flowers instead of leaves. Due to its unusual appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm regions."
