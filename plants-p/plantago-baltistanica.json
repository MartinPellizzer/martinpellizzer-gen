    "intro": "Plantago baltistanica, commonly known as the Baltistan plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
