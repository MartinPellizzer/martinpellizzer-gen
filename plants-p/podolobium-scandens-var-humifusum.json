    "intro": "Podolobium scandens var. humifusum, commonly known as the creeping podolobium, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments."
