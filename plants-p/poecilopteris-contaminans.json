    "intro": "Poecilopteris contaminans, commonly known as the contaminated cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and stream banks. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Poecilopteris contaminans is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is known for its ecological adaptability in disturbed habitats."
