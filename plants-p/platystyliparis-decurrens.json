    "intro": "Platystyliparis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist environments. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
