    "intro": "Palmorchis sobralioides, commonly known as the Sobral's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique structure that resembles a palm, hence its common name. It has a delicate, ephemeral bloom period, typically occurring in the late summer months. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
