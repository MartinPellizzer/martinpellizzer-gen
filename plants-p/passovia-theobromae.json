    "intro": "Passovia theobromae, commonly known as the cocoa orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in the understory of forests. It produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil. Its unique botanical features make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and a symbol of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
