    "intro": "Ptilimnium fluviatile, commonly known as the river ptilimnium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in marshy areas. Ptilimnium fluviatile is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, saturated soils."
