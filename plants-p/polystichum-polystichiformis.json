    "intro": "Polystichum polystichiformis, commonly known as the giant cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky cliffs or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
