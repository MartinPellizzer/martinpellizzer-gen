    "intro": "Platostoma flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Platostoma flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
