    "intro": "Psychotria mycetoides, commonly known as the \"fungal psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Psychotria mycetoides is also notable for its association with certain mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
