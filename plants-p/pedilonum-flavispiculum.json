    "intro": "Pedilonum flavispiculum, commonly known as the golden-spined pedilonum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow spines that adorn its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum flavispiculum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
