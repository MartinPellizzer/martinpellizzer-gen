    "intro": "Poa hartzii, commonly known as Hartz's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Poa hartzii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions."
