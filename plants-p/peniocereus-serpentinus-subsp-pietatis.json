    "intro": "Peniocereus serpentinus subsp. pietatis, commonly known as the Mexican Moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its nocturnal blooming habit is a key botanical feature, attracting specific pollinators. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
