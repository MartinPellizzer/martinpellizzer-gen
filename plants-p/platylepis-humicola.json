    "intro": "Platylepis humicola, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is often found in swampy or boggy environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like formation. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of small, white or pale yellow blooms that appear in late spring. Platylepis humicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
