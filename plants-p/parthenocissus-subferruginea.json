    "intro": "Parthenocissus subferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, fences, and trees. The leaves change color in the fall, turning from green to shades of red and orange, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
