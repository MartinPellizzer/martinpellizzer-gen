    "intro": "Polystichum subtripteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, narrow pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
