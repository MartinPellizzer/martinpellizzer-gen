    "intro": "Perebea lecointei, commonly known as the Lecointe's perebea, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in the shaded, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique botanical features include elliptical leaves with prominent veins and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
