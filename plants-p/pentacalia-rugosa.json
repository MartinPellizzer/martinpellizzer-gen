    "intro": "Pentacalia rugosa, commonly known as the rough pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
