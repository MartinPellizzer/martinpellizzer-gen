    "intro": "Platantheroides unellezii, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. It has a short, slender stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
