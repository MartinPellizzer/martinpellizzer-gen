    "intro": "Pellaea raddiana, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern."
