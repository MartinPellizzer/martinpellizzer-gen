    "intro": "Pilosella spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its low-growing, spreading habit. Its leaves are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, with a hairy surface that gives it its scientific name. Pilosella spathulata produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators."
