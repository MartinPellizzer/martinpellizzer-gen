    "intro": "Pteris furcaus, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two distinct parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Pteris furcaus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
