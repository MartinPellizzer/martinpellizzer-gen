It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
