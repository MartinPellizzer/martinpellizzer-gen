    "intro": "Phelipanche aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant is characterized by its deep taproot, which can penetrate several meters into the soil, making it difficult to eradicate. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to compete with crops."
