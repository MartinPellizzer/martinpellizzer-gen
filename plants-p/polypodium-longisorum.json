    "intro": "Polypodium longisorum, commonly known as the long-awned water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium longisorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
