    "intro": "Pyrus rufoferruginea subvar. insulsa, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a variant of the white pear species native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, clustered leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by white to pale yellow fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional Japanese horticulture."
