    "intro": "Pyrus cardinalis, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit that requires a process called \"maceration\" to become edible. The tree produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by clustered fruits that ripen in autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
