    "intro": "Pentapetes, commonly known as the five-lobed or five-angled plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that often display vibrant colors. The genus includes several species, such as Pentapetes phyllonotus and Pentapetes tetrandra, which are native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and their flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
