    "intro": "Phymatodes ottoniana, commonly known as the Otto's phymatode, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
