It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. Pandanus cubicus is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of thatch."
