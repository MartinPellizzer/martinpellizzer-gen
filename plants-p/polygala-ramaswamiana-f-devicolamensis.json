    "intro": "Polygala ramaswamiana f. devicolamensis, commonly known as the Ramaswamiana pogostemon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred corolla that is distinctive in both morphology and color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in the understorey of tropical evergreen forests. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly pubescent underside, while its flowers are usually pale pink to white. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native region."
