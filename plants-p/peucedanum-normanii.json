It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and fennel, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires protection."
