    "intro": "Piper villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy pipevine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves contain alkaloids, making it toxic to livestock and humans if ingested. The plant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
