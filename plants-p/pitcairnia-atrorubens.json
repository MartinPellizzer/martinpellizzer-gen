    "intro": "Pitcairnia atrorubens, commonly known as the red-veined pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and its vibrant, red and green striped leaves that give it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that surround the small, clustered flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
