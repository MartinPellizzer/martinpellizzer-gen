    "intro": "Pedicularis canadensis var. dobbsii, commonly known as the Canadian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This variety is characterized by its hairy stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
