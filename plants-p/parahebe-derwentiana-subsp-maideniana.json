It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-forming habit, often used in rock gardens or as ground cover. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in spring, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth and seasonal flowering."
