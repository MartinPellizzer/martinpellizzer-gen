It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn reddish when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
