    "intro": "Prunus americana mollis, commonly known as the American cherry or smooth cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and features smooth, gray bark with a distinctive flaky texture. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet red drupes. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in autumn. Prunus americana mollis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full sunlight."
