    "intro": "Phillyrea cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical to heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. Phillyrea cordifolia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
