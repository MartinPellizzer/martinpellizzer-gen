    "intro": "Poa fibrifera, commonly known as the silky grass or fibrous bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wet meadows. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa fibrifera is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its decorative appeal."
