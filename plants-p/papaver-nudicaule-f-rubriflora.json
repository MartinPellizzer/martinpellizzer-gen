It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that contrast beautifully with its pale green foliage. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The f. rubriflora form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
