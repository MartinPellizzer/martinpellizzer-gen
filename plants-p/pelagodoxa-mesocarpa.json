It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important species like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into edible, fleshy fruits. The fruit's mesocarp, or middle layer, is thick and fibrous, providing the primary edible portion. Due to its unique botanical features, it holds potential for agricultural and medicinal research."
