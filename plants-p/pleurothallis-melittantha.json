    "intro": "Pleurothallis melittantha, commonly known as the bee-pollinated orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly fragrant scent, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique pollination mechanism and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
