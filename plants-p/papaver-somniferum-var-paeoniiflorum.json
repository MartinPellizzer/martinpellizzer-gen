    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. paeoniiflorum, commonly known as the peony-flowered opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking, peony-like flower heads. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its historical significance in the production of opium. The plant features a robust stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces large, showy flowers in a range of colors including red, pink, and white. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive organs, which facilitates self-pollination. The plant's botanical features make it both aesthetically appealing and historically significant in the context of medicinal and illicit drug production."
