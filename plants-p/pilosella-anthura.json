    "intro": "Pilosella anthura, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is notable for its bright yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Pilosella anthura typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude environments."
