    "intro": "Pseudencyclia, commonly known as the false cycad, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a feature common in cycads. Pseudencyclia species are native to various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates."
