    "intro": "Pereskia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered pereskia, is a shrub-like plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, as it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its woody structure and succulent-like appearance make it well adapted to arid environments. Pereskia verticillata is often found growing in coastal areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
