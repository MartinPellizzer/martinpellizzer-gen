    "intro": "Pterostylis roensis, commonly known as the Richmond greenhood, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a greenish-brown pouch-shaped labellum and a slender, erect stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, particularly flies, due to their attractive, insect-like appearance. Pterostylis roensis is a relatively small orchid, with leaves that are usually narrow and grass-like in appearance."
