    "intro": "Pyrrhopappus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweeds, and is characterized by its showy, bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pyrrhopappus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
