    "intro": "Physaria arenosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Physaria arenosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
