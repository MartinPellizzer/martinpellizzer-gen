    "intro": "Pilosella glomerata, commonly known as clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Pilosella glomerata is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
