It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spike that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies.
