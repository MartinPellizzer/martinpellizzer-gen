It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion. It is often used in landscaping and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
