    "intro": "Polypodium filix-femina, commonly known as the female fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
