    "intro": "Paepalanthus subtilis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette of long, hairy, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its unique appearance. It produces tall flower spikes that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
