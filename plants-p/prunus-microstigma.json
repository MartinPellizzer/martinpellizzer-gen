    "intro": "Prunus microstigma, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or small-fruited cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, edible berries. Prunus microstigma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
