    "intro": "Phyllanthus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that attract various birds and animals. Phyllanthus macranthus is often found in coastal areas, disturbed soils, and secondary forests, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat provider. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
