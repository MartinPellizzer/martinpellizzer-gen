    "intro": "Paullinia tricornis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in humid, lowland areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
