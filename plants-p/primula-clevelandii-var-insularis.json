    "intro": "Primula clevelandii var. insularis, commonly known as the San Clemente Island primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a low-growing perennial herb with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from invasive plants and habitat loss."
