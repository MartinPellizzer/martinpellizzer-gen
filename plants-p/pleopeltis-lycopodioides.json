    "intro": "Pleopeltis lycopodioides, commonly known as the rock holly, is a member of the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered, giving it a unique appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Pleopeltis lycopodioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained habitats."
