    "intro": "Poa pseudonemoralis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to blue in color. Poa pseudonemoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
