    "intro": "Pseudobombax pulchellum, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red bracts that resemble hibiscus flowers, though it is not related to the true hibiscus. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically hidden within the bracts. Pseudobombax pulchellum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
