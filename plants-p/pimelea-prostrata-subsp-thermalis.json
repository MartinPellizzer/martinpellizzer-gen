    "intro": "Pimelea prostrata subsp. thermalis, commonly known as the Thermal Heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in heathland and coastal environments. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in native garden settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
