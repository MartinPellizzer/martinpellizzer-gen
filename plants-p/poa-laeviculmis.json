    "intro": "Poa laeviculmis, commonly known as the smooth bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, Poa laeviculmis is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
