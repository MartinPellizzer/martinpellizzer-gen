    "intro": "Pilosella lactucella subsp. littuanica, commonly known as the Baltic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in compact heads. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
