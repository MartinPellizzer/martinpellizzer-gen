    "intro": "Pinus vanhouttei, commonly known as the Vanhoutte pine, is a species of conifer native to the eastern and southern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The Vanhoutte pine is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions, including pollution and compacted soils."
