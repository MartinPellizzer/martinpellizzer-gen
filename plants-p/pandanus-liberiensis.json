    "intro": "Pandanus liberiensis, commonly known as the African screw pine, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are typically long and narrow. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their fibrous texture."
