    "intro": "Purgosea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or purple, which are edible but have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Purgosea alpestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
