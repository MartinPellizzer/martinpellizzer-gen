    "intro": "Piptadenia leptocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian snakewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used in traditional construction and crafts."
