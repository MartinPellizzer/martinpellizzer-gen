    "intro": "Plantago psammophila, commonly known as the sand plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
