It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and elliptic leaves that are smooth and glabrous on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests."
