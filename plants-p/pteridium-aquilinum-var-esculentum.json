    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. esculentum, commonly known as the edible fern or bracken, is a variant of the common bracken fern. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Its rhizomes are the primary edible part, though they contain compounds that can be toxic if not prepared properly. This plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces."
