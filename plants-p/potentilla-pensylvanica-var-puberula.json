    "intro": "Potentilla pensylvanica var. puberula, commonly known as the Pennsylvania cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright, multi-branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and streambanks."
