    "intro": "Perama galioides f. cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf lily, is a rare and unique botanical variant found in specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers during the warmer months, typically between autumn and spring. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
