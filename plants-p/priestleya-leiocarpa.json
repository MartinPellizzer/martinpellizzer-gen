It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, pale green flowers that resemble leaves, a feature that aids in its camouflage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rare and elusive nature, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
