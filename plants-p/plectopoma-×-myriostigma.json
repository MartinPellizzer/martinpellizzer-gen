It belongs to the family Fasciolariidae and is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell with a distinct, elongated spire. The shell is typically pale in color, with a smooth surface and a faintly ribbed pattern. This marine gastropod is found in tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. Its botanical aspects are less emphasized compared to its ecological and economic significance in marine environments."
