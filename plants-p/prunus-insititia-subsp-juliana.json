    "intro": "Prunus insititia subsp. juliana, commonly known as the black-cherry or European black cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in late summer. Its fruits are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in jams and preserves. The subspecies juliana is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller leaves compared to other subspecies of Prunus insititia."
