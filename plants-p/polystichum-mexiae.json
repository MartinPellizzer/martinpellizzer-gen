    "intro": "Polystichum mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum mexiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
