    "intro": "Pinus laricio, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, scaly bark that becomes thick and fissured with age. The tree produces long, slender cones that contain edible seeds known as pine nuts. Its needle-like leaves are typically arranged in pairs and are dark green with a slight bluish tint. Pinus laricio is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
