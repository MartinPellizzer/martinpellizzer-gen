    "intro": "Peucedanum euphimiae, commonly known as the Euphymia angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
