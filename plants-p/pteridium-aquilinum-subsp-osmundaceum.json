    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. osmundaceum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a robust fern species characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is widely distributed across temperate regions. The plant produces spores in a distinctive, shield-shaped sorus located on the underside of its fronds. It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. While it plays a role in soil stabilization, it can also become invasive in certain ecosystems."
