    "intro": "Platanthera densa, commonly known as the dense lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem with numerous small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
