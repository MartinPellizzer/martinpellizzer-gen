    "intro": "Pileostegia viburnoides, commonly known as the climbing viburnum, is a deciduous vine native to Central and South America. It features opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its twining stems allow it to climb and cover structures, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is adaptable to various soil types and thrives in partial to full sun."
