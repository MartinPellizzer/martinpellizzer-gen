    "intro": "Picea abies var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited Norway spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown cones, which set it apart from the typical green cones of the standard species. The plant is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments. It has needle-like leaves and produces both male and female cones for reproduction. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique fruiting characteristics."
