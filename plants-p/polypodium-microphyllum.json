    "intro": "Polypodium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its tiny, serrated leaves are adapted for efficient water retention. Polypodium microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
