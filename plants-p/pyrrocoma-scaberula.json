    "intro": "Pyrrocoma scaberula, commonly known as the roughleaf pyrrocoma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to alpine environments."
