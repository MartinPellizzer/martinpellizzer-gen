    "intro": "Polypodium saffordii, commonly known as the Safford's polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
