    "intro": "Podocarpus henkelii, commonly known as the Henkel's podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
