    "intro": "Polyxena longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in rocky or well-drained soils. Polyxena longituba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
