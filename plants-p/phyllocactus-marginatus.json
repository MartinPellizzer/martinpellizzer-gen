    "intro": "Phyllocactus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate phyllocactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that grow in a sprawling or shrub-like form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
