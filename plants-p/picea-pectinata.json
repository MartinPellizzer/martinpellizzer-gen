    "intro": "Picea pectinata, commonly known as the Mongolian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. Picea pectinata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
