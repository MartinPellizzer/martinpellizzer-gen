    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. condensatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its dense, compact rosette of small, oval-shaped leaves. It typically features pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in various parts of the world. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed in many habitats."
