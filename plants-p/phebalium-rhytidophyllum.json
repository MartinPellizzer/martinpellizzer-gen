    "intro": "Phebalium rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved peacock wattles, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its distinctive, peacock-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant has rough, fissured leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in coastal and dry inland regions, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Phebalium rhytidophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
