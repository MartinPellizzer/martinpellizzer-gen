    "intro": "Populus litwinowiana, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soil and extreme temperatures. Its fast growth rate makes it a popular choice for reforestation and ornamental planting in temperate regions."
