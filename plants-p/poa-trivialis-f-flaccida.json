    "intro": "Poa trivialis f. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground. The leaves are generally more floppy or drooping compared to the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of wetlands. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
