    "intro": "Polybotrya sessilisora, commonly known as the sessile fronded fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stalk without a petiole. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
