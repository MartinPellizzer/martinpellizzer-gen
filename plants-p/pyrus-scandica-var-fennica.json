    "intro": "Pyrus scandica var. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish whitebeam, is a variant of the common whitebeam, native to parts of northern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often climbing growth habit. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a smooth margin and a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, round berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky areas."
