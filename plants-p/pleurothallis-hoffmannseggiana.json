It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
