It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit, with broad, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
