    "intro": "Pachypodium eburneum, commonly known as the Madagascar moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, woody stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces a distinctive crown of spiny, lobed leaves during the rainy season. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem. Pachypodium eburneum is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
