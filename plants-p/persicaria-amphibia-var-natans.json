It is characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that remain just above the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and can be found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its adaptability to aquatic conditions makes it a common sight in freshwater habitats."
