    "intro": "Psephellus sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh environmental conditions, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
