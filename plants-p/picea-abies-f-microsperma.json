It features dense, conical foliage with short, dark green needles that are slightly twisted. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique, compact shape."
