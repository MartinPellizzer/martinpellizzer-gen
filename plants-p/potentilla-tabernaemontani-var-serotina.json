    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring wiry, many-branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, distinguishing it from other varieties. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy surface. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
