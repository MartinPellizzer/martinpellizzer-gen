    "intro": "Protium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
