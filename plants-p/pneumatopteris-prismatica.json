    "intro": "Pneumatopteris prismatica, commonly known as the prism fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Pneumatopteris prismatica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
