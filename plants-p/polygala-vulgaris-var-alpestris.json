    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
