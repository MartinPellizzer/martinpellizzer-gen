    "intro": "Pilosella schultesii subsp. pseudauriculiformis, commonly known as the Alpine pilosella, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often on rocky slopes and meadows. Its leaves are hairy and slightly lobed, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
