    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 malifolia, commonly known as the apple pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a common pear (Pyrus communis) and a wild species of pyrus. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring attractive, glossy leaves and showy white or pink flowers in spring. The fruit is typically small, tart, and not suitable for eating but is often used in ornamental gardening. This plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit."
