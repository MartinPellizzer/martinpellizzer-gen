    "intro": "Perotis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flower bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it conserve water. Perotis longiflora plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
