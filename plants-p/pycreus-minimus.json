    "intro": "Pycreus minimus, commonly known as the small pycreus, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pycreus minimus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
