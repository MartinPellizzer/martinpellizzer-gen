    "intro": "Persea balansae, commonly known as the Balansae avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a single-seeded berry with a thick, leathery exterior. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for commercial fruit production."
