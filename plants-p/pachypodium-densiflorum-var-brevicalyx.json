    "intro": "Pachypodium densiflorum var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a thick, bottle-shaped stem with a spiny exterior, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens."
