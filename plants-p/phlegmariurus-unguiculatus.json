    "intro": "Phlegmariurus unguiculatus, commonly known as the common zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a prostrate, leafy stem that bears small, oval-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. This moss is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization."
