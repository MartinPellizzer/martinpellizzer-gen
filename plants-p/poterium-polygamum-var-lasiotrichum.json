    "intro": "Poterium polygamum var. lasiotrichum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, green to blue-gray leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its succulent leaves help it store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. This variety is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
