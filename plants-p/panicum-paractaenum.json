    "intro": "Panicum paractaenum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
