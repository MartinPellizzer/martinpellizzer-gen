    "intro": "Polypodium pichinchense, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often scaly fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. Polypodium pichinchense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
