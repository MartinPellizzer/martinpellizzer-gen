    "intro": "Poa dalavarica, commonly known as the Dalavari grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-rowed florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
