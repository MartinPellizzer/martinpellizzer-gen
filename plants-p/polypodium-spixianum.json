    "intro": "Polypodium spixianum, commonly known as the Spix's shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium spixianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
