    "intro": "Petrocosmea purpureomaculata, commonly known as the purple-spotted rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive purple spots. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
