    "intro": "Pritchardia elliptica, commonly known as the Tahitian papaia, is a species of cycad native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a cone-like structure, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
