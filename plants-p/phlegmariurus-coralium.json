    "intro": "Phlegmariurus coralium, commonly known as the coral moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on damp rocks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its bright green, leaf-like structures arranged in a dense, cushion-like form. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for propagation. Phlegmariurus coralium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
