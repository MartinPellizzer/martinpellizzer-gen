    "intro": "Platymitium, commonly known as the flatleaf fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels. Platymitium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
