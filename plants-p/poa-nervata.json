    "intro": "Poa nervata, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Poa nervata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
