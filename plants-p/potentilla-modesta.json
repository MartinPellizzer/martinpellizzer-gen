    "intro": "Potentilla modesta, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with many slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Potentilla modesta thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
