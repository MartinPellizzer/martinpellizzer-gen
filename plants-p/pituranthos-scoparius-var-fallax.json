    "intro": "Pituranthos scoparius var. fallax, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features erect, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in grayish-green, fuzzy foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaped gardens."
