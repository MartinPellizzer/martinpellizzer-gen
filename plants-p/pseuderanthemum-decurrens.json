    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum decurrens, commonly known as the trailing pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, purple, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pseuderanthemum decurrens is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
