    "intro": "Pilosocereus floccosus subsp. floccosus, commonly known as the woolly nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
