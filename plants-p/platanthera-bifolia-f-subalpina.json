    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its intricate, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in open meadows. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions, with a short growing season and a reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
