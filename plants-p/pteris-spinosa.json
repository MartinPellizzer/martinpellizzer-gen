    "intro": "Pteris spinosa, commonly known as the spinous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Pteris spinosa is also noted for its ability to tolerate low light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
