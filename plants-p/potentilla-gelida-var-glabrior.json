    "intro": "Potentilla gelida var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves that are often glabrous (smooth) on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine environments."
