    "intro": "Paratropia lucescens, commonly known as the luminous paratropia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in low light conditions. The plant has a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which bloom at night, emit a mild fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique botanical features, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
