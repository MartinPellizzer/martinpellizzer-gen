    "intro": "Physalis hirsuta var. integrifolia, commonly known as the hairy physalis or the Indian cherry, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, inflated, orange-red calyces enclosing the fruit. The fruit, which resembles a small lantern, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
