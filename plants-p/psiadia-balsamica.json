    "intro": "Psiadia balsamica, commonly known as the balsam weed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can pose a challenge in ecological restoration efforts."
