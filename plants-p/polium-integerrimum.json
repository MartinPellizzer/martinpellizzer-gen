    "intro": "Polium integerrimum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, stiff growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
