It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.
