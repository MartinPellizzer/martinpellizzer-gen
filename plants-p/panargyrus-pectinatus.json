    "intro": "Panargyrus pectinatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by oblong, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
