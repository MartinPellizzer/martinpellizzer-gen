The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. Pennisetum plumosum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental grasses and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
