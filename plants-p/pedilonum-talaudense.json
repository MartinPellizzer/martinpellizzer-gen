    "intro": "Pedilonum talaudense, commonly known as the Talaud Islands starfruit, is a tropical plant native to the Talaud Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which resembles a small, yellow star with a textured surface. The plant typically grows in humid, coastal environments and thrives in well-drained sandy soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is edible, often consumed raw or used in local culinary traditions."
