    "intro": "Pultenaea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pultenaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Pultenaea humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
