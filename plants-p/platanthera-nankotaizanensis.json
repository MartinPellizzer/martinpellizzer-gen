    "intro": "Platanthera nankotaizanensis, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
