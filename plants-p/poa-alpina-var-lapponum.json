    "intro": "Poa alpina var. lapponum, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
