    "intro": "Pittosporum xanthanthum, commonly known as the golden pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ability to tolerate coastal conditions also makes it suitable for landscaping in maritime environments."
