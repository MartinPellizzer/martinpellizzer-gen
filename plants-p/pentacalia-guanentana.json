    "intro": "Pentacalia guanentana, commonly known as the Guanentan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are usually covered in fine pubescence. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements."
