    "intro": "Piper enenyasense, commonly known as the Enenyasense pepper plant, is a species of flowering vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, peppery fruits. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ethnobotanical studies. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial use compared to other pepper species."
