It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that are often mistaken for seeds, which are actually called mericarps. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has a mild, aromatic scent and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
