    "intro": "Periphanes strumosa, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Periphanes strumosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
