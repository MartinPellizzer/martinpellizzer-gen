    "intro": "Potentilla litoralis var. ovium, commonly known as the coastal potentilla, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal restoration projects and erosion control."
