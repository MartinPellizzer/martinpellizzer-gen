    "intro": "Prismatocarpus roelloides, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry deciduous forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
