    "intro": "Pilocereus setosus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a columnar growth habit and produces small, red fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes. Its unique nocturnal blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for evening gardens and botanical collections."
