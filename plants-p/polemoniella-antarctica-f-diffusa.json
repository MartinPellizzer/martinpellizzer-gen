    "intro": "Polemoniella antarctica f. diffusa, commonly known as the Antarctic polemonium, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme environments. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is native to the southern regions of South America. This plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it blooms during the brief growing season in its cold, high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
