    "intro": "Peperomia fumeana var. genuina, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia fumeana var. genuina is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
