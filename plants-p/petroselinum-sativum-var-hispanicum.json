    "intro": "Petroselinum sativum var. hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish parsley, is a cultivar of the parsley plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically lighter green than those of regular parsley. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often used as a herb in Mediterranean cuisine. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, requiring full sun for optimal growth. Spanish parsley is valued for its mild, fresh flavor and is commonly used in soups, stews, and as a garnish."
