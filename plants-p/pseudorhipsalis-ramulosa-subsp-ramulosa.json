    "intro": "Pseudorhipsalis ramulosa subsp. ramulosa, commonly known as the coral cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It features a branching structure with numerous small, cylindrical stems that resemble coral, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive dry periods."
