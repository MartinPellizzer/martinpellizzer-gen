    "intro": "Poa densa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and compact, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent. This trait makes it an interesting subject for studying vegetative reproduction in grasses."
