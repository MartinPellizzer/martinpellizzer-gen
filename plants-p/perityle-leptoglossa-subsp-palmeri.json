It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in a spherical shape. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
