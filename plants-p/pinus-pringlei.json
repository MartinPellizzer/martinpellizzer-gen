    "intro": "Pinus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that mature over several years, with the female cones releasing seeds in the fall. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pinus pringlei is considered critically endangered."
