    "intro": "Polypodium paucinervatum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle."
