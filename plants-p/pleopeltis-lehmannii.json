    "intro": "Pleopeltis lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its clustered, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
