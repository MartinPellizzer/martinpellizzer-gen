    "intro": "Pyrola uliginosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to moist, shaded forest environments in North America. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The variety gracilis is distinguished by its more slender leaves and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Pyrola uliginosa."
