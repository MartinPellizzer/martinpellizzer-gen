    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. gaveana, commonly known as the gaveana butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, appearing in clusters. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
