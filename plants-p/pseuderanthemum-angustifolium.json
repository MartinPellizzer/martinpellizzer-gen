    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, resembling those of true arums. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
