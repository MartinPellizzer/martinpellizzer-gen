    "intro": "Pycreus unioloides var. angulatus, commonly known as the angular pycreus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves that often have a distinct angular appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
