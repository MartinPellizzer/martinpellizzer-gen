    "intro": "Pontia montana, commonly known as the mountain cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous vegetables. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces oval, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Pontia montana is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
