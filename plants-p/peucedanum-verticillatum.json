    "intro": "Peucedanum verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered cowparsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, ribbed fruits that mature in the fall. Peucedanum verticillatum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
