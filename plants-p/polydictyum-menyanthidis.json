    "intro": "Polydictyum menyanthidis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
