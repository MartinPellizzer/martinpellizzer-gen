    "intro": "Pedicularis lanigera, commonly known as the downy lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Pedicularis lanigera is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
