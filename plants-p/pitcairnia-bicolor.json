    "intro": "Pitcairnia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that features two distinct color zones, typically red and yellow. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to collect and store water in its native humid environment. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered around the central spadix, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
