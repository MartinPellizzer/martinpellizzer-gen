    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus latilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Pseudocyclosorus latilobus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
