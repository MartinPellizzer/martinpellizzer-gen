    "intro": "Pleurothallis truncicola, commonly known as the truncate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a slight fragrance. It is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptability to moist, nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
