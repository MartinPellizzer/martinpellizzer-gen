    "intro": "Polanisia suffruticosa, commonly known as the purple-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring woody stems that become more prominent with age. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Polanisia suffruticosa is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
