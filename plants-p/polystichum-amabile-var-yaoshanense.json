    "intro": "Polystichum amabile var. yaoshanense, commonly known as the Yaoshan shield fern, is a variant of the amabile fern species native to China. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
