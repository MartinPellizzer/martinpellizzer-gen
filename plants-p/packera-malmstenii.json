    "intro": "Packera malmstenii, commonly known as Malmsten's ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Packera malmstenii is an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and other wildlife."
