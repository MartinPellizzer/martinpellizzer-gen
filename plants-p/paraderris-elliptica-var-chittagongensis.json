    "intro": "Paraderris elliptica var. chittagongensis, commonly known as the Chittagong elliptic fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it attaches itself to rocks or tree trunks via its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
