    "intro": "Picea pungens glauca-pendens, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the blue spruce that exhibits a pendulous growth habit. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and striking blue-gray foliage that turns a deep blue in winter. The needles are short, stiff, and have a distinctive blue waxy coating, which gives the tree its characteristic appearance. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America and thrives in cold climates with well-drained soil. This evergreen conifer is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
