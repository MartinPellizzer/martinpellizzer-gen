    "intro": "Pisonia zapallo var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani pisonia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a serrated edge. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind."
