    "intro": "Plexipus incisus, commonly known as the sharp-edged fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely serrated margins that give it its common name. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
