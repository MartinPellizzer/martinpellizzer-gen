    "intro": "Phyllanthus graveolens var. glaber, commonly known as the rough-leafed phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in the treatment of liver ailments and as an antiseptic."
