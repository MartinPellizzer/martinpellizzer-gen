    "intro": "Pinus brevispica, commonly known as the short-needle pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its short, stiff needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. Its cones open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The short-needle pine thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
