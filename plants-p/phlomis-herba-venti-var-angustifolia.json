    "intro": "Phlomis herba-venti var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems covered in grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
