It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.
