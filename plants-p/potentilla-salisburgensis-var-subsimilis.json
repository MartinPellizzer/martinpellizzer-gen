    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. subsimilis, commonly known as the Salzburg potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems and hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, adapting to its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
