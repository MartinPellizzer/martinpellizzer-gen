    "intro": "Pinus ne-plus-ultra, commonly known as the \"extreme pine,\" is a rare and unusual species of conifer native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more rigid than those of other pine species. The tree produces distinctive cones that are often covered in a dense layer of resin, which helps protect the seeds from moisture and pests. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
