    "intro": "Phacelia purshii, commonly known as Pursh's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia purshii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
