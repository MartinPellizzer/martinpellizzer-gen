    "intro": "Phymatopteris taeniata var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate wall fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wall fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The palmate varietal form is characterized by its broader, more rounded fronds compared to the typical varietal form."
