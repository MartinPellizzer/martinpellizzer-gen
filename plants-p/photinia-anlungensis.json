    "intro": "Photinia anlungensis, commonly known as the red leaf photinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its striking red or pink leaves, which are often more vibrant than those of other photinia species. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements. Photinia anlungensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
