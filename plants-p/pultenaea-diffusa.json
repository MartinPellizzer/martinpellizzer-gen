It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
