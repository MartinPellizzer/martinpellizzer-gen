    "intro": "Paronychia capitata subsp. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
