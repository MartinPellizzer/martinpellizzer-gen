    "intro": "Pyrus syriaca var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stalked whitebeam, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. Native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
