    "intro": "Panicum chionachne, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink to white plumes that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
