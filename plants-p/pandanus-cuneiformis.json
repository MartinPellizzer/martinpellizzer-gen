    "intro": "Pandanus cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of the Pandanus genus. Its fibrous leaves are used in basket-making and thatching by indigenous communities. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in saline or brackish soils."
