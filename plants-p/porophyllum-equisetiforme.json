    "intro": "Porophyllum equisetiforme, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branched stem covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Porophyllum equisetiforme is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
