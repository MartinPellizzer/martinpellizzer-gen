    "intro": "Pandanus yalna, commonly known as the Yalna pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and have been traditionally used for weaving baskets and mats. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or along shorelines."
