    "intro": "Polystichum kathmanduense, commonly known as the Kathmandu holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum kathmanduense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
