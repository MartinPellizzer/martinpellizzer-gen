    "intro": "Phalocallis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers. Phalocallis species typically have a short lifespan, often blooming only once before dying, which makes them rare and sought after by botanists and collectors. Their growth habits and floral structures reflect adaptations to their specific ecological niches."
