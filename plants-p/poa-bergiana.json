    "intro": "Poa bergiana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Poa bergiana is often cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization in mountainous areas."
