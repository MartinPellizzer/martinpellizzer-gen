    "intro": "Pelargonium podophylloides, commonly known as the broad-leaf geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is typically evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for containers or rock gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The botanical features of Pelargonium podophylloides make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
