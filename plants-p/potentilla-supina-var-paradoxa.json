It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to egg-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
