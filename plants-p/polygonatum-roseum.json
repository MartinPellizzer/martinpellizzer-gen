    "intro": "Polygonatum roseum, commonly known as the red-flowered Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features long, arching stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-red. Its berries are dark blue and edible, though often used in traditional medicine. Polygonatum roseum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
