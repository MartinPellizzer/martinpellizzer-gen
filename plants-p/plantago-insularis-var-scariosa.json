    "intro": "Plantago insularis var. scariosa, commonly known as the scaly plantain, is a perennial herb native to certain islands in the Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive scaly texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
