    "intro": "Prosthechea faresiana, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with tightly packed, fleshy leaves. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Prosthechea faresiana is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
