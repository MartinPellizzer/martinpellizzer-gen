    "intro": "Poa arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Poaceae family."
