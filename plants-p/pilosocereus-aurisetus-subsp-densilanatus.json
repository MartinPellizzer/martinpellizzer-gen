    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurisetus subsp. densilanatus, commonly known as the dense-lanate cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its densely covered stems with white, woolly hair, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
