    "intro": "Phlomoides speciosa var. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leaf phlomoides, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, spires of purple or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
