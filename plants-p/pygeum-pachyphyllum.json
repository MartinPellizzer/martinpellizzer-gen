It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its fruit is edible and has been used traditionally for its nutritional value. The plant's resilience to drought makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
