    "intro": "Pseudocymopterus macdougalii, commonly known as the Macdougal's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded forest habitats, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny, dust-like seeds. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
