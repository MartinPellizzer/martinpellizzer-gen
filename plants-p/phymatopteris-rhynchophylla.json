    "intro": "Phymatopteris rhynchophylla, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates."
