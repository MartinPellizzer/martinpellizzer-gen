    "intro": "Polygonum viviparum var. capitatum, commonly known as the water pepper or swamp willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy includes vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to colonize moist soils efficiently, making it a common species in marshy and riparian habitats."
