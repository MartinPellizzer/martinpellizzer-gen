    "intro": "Polypodium intermedium var. cambricoides, commonly known as the Cambridgeshire polypody, is a fern native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant prefers shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader and more robust fronds compared to the typical form of *Polypodium intermedium*."
