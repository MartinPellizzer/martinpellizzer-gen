    "intro": "Pharnaceum marginatum, commonly known as the margined pharnaceum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and often showy orchid species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive margins. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and are clustered in small inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
