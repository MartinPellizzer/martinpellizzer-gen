    "intro": "Pteris nigricans, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
