    "intro": "Parsonsia cristata, commonly known as the crown vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, showy orange or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Parsonsia cristata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, moist climates."
