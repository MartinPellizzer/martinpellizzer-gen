It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found near water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in terminal inflorescences. The fruit, which is a fibrous capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by water or animals."
