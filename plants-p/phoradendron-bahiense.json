    "intro": "Phoradendron bahiense, commonly known as the Bahamian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
