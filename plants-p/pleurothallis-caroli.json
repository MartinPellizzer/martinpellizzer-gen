    "intro": "Pleurothallis caroli, commonly known as Carol's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Pleurothallis caroli is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
