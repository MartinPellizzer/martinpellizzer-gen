    "intro": "Phlox alaskensis, commonly known as Alaska phlox, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and alpine meadows. Its stems are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Alaska phlox is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
