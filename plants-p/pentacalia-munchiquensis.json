    "intro": "Pentacalia munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentacalia munchiquensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
