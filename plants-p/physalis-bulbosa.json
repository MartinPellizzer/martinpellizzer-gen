    "intro": "Physalis bulbosa, commonly known as the bladderfruit or Chinese lantern, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange, inflated calyces that encase the small, yellow berries. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that transition into the distinctive lantern-like fruits. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
