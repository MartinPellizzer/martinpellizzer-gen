    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris var. leucantha, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is known for its medicinal properties, including potential use in treating inflammation and skin conditions. The plant's name reflects its historical use as a remedy for ailments, though it is not related to true nettles."
