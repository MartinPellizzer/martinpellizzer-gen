It is characterized by its striking blue and white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies."
