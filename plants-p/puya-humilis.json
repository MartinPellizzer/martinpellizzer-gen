    "intro": "Puya humilis, commonly known as the Andean grass or the lesser torch plant, is a perennial plant native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spire-like inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils. Its leaves are narrow and fibrous, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Puya humilis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional Andean medicine."
