    "intro": "Perotis indica var. keelakaraiensis, commonly known as the Keelakarai grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
