    "intro": "Pittosporum colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. These flowers give way to small, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air."
