    "intro": "Pandanus akiakiensis, commonly known as the Kauai pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in the local flora. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
