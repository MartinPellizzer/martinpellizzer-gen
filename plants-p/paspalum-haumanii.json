    "intro": "Paspalum haumanii, commonly known as the Manilla grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to flooded conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Paspalum haumanii is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects."
