It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, dark green leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are typically borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.
