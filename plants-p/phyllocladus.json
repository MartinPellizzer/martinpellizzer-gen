    "intro": "Phyllocladus, commonly known as the celery tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cupressaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring flattened, leaf-like stems called phylloclades that perform photosynthesis. The genus includes several species, such as Phyllocladus australis and Phyllocladus glaucus, which are native to Australia and New Zealand. These plants typically grow in coastal or mountainous regions and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Their distinctive appearance and ecological significance make them an important part of their native ecosystems."
