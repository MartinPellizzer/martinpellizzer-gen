    "intro": "Pourthiaea villosa var. yokohamensis, commonly known as the Yokohama thistle, is a variant of the thistle species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny, purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, showing adaptability to saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological niche."
