    "intro": "Paracolpodium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan colpodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
