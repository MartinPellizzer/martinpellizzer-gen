    "intro": "Polypodium flagellare, commonly known as the rattlesnake plantain, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium flagellare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
