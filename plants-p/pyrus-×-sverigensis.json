    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 sverigensis, commonly known as the Swedish pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyraster and Pyrus communis. It is characterized by its small, ornamental fruits and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its edible qualities. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers in spring. The Swedish pear is native to southern Sweden and is well adapted to temperate climates."
