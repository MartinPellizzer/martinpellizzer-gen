    "intro": "Plantago perreymondii var. induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft pubescence, giving the plant its characteristic velvet-like texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on erect, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry grasslands. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
