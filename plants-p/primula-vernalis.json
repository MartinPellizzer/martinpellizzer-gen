    "intro": "Primula vernalis, commonly known as the spring primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it one of the first flowers to appear after winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in woodland or alpine environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in early-season ecosystems."
