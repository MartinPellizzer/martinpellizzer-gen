It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Plagiochloa ciliaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
