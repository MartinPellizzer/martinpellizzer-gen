    "intro": "Psychotria hawaiiensis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian Psychotria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptic to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution within Hawaii's diverse ecosystems."
