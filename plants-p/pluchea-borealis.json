    "intro": "Pluchea borealis, commonly known as Arctic groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Pluchea borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is part of the Asteraceae family."
