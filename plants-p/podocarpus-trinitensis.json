    "intro": "Podocarpus trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad ironwood, is a species of conifer native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has historically been used for construction and furniture. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
