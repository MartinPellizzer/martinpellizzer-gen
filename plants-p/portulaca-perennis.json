    "intro": "Portulaca perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, vibrant flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to retain water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions. The flowers remain open for only a short period, typically during the morning, and are known for their resilience and ornamental value."
