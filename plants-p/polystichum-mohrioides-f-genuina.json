    "intro": "Polystichum mohrioides f. genuina, commonly known as the Mohrioides fern, is a cultivar of the sword fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are glossy and often have a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This fern is prized for its compact growth habit and elegant appearance in both indoor and outdoor settings."
