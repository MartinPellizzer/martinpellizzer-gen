    "intro": "Pyrus septiloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forest regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves with seven lobes and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like apple, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for hybridization with other pear species."
