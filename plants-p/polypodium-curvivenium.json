    "intro": "Polypodium curvivenium, commonly known as the curled polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
