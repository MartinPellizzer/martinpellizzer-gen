    "intro": "Pavonia schrankii, commonly known as the redroot false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are reddish in color, giving it its common name. Pavonia schrankii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
