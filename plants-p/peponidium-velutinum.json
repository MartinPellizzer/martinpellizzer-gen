    "intro": "Peponidium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated fruits that range in color from pale green to yellow when mature. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still tender and immature, making it a popular vegetable in Asian cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a trellis for support due to its climbing growth habit."
