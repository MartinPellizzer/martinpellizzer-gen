    "intro": "Populus suaveolens pyramidalis, commonly known as the fragrant poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its pyramidal growth habit gives it a conical shape, making it a striking ornamental plant. The species is valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
