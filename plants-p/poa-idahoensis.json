    "intro": "Poa idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, sod-like growth patterns. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in various habitats. Poa idahoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and restoration projects."
