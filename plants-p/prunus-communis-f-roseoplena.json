    "intro": "Prunus communis f. roseoplena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. The flowers are typically pink or white, with many petals that create a full, fluffy effect. This cultivar is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public landscapes. It retains the general growth habit of the parent species, with a rounded canopy and moderate growth rate."
