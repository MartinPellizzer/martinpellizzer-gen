    "intro": "Primula pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact size and delicate flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
