    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and lilac, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact size and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a delicate, ornamental plant."
