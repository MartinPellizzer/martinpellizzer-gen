    "intro": "Pteris morii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Pteris morii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
