It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
