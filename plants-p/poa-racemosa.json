    "intro": "Poa racemosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a racemose inflorescence, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Poa racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
