    "intro": "Pelecyphora minima, commonly known as the small pelecyphora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Pelecyphora minima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rich, organic soil."
