    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. septenata, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
