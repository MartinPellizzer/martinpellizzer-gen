    "intro": "Polystichum minutissimum, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow no taller than 10 centimeters. The plant features a compact rosette of sterile fronds surrounding a central fiddlehead, which is a tightly curled young frond. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Polystichum minutissimum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
