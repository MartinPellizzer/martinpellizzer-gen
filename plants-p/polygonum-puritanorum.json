    "intro": "Polygonum puritanorum, commonly known as the New England arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil. Polygonum puritanorum is also known for its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
