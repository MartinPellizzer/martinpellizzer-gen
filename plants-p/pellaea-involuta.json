    "intro": "Pellaea involuta, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, compact rosette of pinnately compound leaves that curl tightly around the central stem. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with finely toothed margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many fern species."
