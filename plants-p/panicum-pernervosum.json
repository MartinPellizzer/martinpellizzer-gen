    "intro": "Panicum pernervosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Panicum pernervosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
