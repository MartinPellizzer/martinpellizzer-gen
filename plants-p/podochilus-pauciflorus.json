    "intro": "Podochilus pauciflorus, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Podochilus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces few flowers per inflorescence, which is reflected in its scientific name \"pauciflorus.\" Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are often pale green or white with a distinct lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
