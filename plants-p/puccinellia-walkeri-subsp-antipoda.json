    "intro": "Puccinellia walkeri subsp. antipoda, commonly known as the Australian sand couch, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
