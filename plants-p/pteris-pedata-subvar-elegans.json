    "intro": "Pteris pedata subvar. elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found growing near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
