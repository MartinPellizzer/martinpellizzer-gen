It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pityopsis pinifolia is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
