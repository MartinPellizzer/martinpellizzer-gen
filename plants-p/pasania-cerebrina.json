    "intro": "Pasania cerebrina, commonly known as the brain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of the human brain, giving it its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait among ferns. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
