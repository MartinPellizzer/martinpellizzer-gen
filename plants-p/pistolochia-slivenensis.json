    "intro": "Pistolochia slivenensis, commonly known as the Slivenensis climbing plant, is a rare and endemic species native to Bulgaria. It is a woody vine characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
