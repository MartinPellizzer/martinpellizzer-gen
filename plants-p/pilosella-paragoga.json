    "intro": "Pilosella paragoga, commonly known as the hairy weed or paragoga hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are hairy and serrated, while the flowers consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. Pilosella paragoga is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators."
