    "intro": "Prunus padus var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-leaf bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
