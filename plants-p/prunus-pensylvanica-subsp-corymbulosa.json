    "intro": "Prunus pensylvanica subsp. corymbulosa, commonly known as the eastern flowering crabapple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, featuring a rounded or irregular crown. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that turn from red to yellow or orange as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping due to its showy blooms and compact size."
