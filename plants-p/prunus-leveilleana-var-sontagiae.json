    "intro": "Prunus leveilleana var. sontagiae, commonly known as the Sontag cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a subtle fragrance. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
