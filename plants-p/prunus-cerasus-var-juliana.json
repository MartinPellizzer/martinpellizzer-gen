    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. juliana, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or dwarf cherry, is a cultivar of the cherry tree characterized by its compact growth habit and early blooming. It produces small, sweet fruits that are typically harvested in late spring, though the flowers are often the main attraction. The plant is native to Japan and is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy pink to white blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The variety is also valued for its use in traditional Japanese gardens and as a symbol of renewal and beauty."
