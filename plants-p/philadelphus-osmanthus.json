It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Philadelphus osmanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant scent."
