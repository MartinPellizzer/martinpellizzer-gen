    "intro": "Pterostylis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sun-orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that resemble a sun-like structure, which is a common trait among sun-orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting various insect pollinators."
