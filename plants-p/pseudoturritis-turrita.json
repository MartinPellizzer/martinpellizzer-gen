    "intro": "Pseudoturritis turrita, commonly known as the turritid snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Turritellidae. It is characterized by its tall, spiraled shell that is typically reddish-brown in color with a smooth, glossy surface. The shell has a distinct conical shape with a narrow, pointed apex and a series of whorls that increase in size as they spiral upward. This species is found in shallow marine environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
