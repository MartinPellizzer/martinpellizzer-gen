    "intro": "Polystichum normale, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum normale is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
