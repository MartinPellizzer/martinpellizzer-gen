    "intro": "Polypodium chimantense, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 fern, is a species of polypody found in the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Polypodium chimantense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
