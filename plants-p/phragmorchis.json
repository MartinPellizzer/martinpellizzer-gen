    "intro": "Phragmorchis, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive spiny leaves and yellowish-green sap, which can be toxic. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid regions, often as shrubs or small trees. Phragmorchis species are adapted to withstand drought conditions with their succulent stems and leaves. The flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia."
