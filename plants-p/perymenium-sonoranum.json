    "intro": "Perymenium sonoranum, commonly known as the Sonoran desert milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Perymenium sonoranum plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
