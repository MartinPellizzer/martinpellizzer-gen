    "intro": "Pseudopegolettia thodei, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a small, stemless cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically greenish-blue in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
