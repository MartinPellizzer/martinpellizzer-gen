    "intro": "Pleurosorus immersus, commonly known as the immersed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species within its native habitat."
