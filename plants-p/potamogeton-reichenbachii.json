It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its presence can indicate good water quality and a healthy aquatic environment."
