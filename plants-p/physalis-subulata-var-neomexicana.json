    "intro": "Physalis subulata var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico groundcherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly New Mexico, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are enclosed in a papery calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, and it typically grows in open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit."
