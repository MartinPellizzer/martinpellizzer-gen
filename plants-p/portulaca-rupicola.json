It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It is drought-tolerant and often found in coastal and desert regions. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
