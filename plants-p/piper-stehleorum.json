It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a glossy green surface and a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use."
