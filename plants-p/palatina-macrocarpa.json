    "intro": "Palatina macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its massive size, with some individuals reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 10 feet. The tree has a distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes thicker and more furrowed with age. Its cones are large and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its dense foliage."
