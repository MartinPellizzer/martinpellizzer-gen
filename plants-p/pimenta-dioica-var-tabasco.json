This variety is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America, characterized by its small, fiery red fruits that are highly valued for their intense heat and flavor. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into the familiar chili peppers, which are used extensively in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The Tabasco pepper is particularly noted for its high capsaicin content, contributing to its distinctive spicy profile."
