    "intro": "Pachypteris multicaulis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-sheath cyclosorus, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in circular formations called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, non-woody sheaths that enclose the young fronds."
