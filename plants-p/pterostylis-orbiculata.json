    "intro": "Pterostylis orbiculata, commonly known as the rounded hammer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, club-shaped flower that resembles a hammer, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem with a single, distinctive flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid is pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted by its intricate mimicry of female wasps."
