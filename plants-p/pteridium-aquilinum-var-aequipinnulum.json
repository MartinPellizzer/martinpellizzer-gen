    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. aequipinnulum, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a variant of the bracken fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is often found in acidic conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of other plants in its vicinity."
