    "intro": "Pedicularis rupestris, commonly known as the rock beard or mountain beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette at the base, and it often grows in rocky or gravelly soils. Pedicularis rupestris is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
