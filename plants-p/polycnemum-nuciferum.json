    "intro": "Polycnemum nuciferum, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the water surface and establish dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves floating on the water's surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by water currents. Polycnemum nuciferum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water flow and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
