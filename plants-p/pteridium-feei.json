    "intro": "Pteridium feei, commonly known as the Chinese bracken, is a species of fern native to Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteridium feei is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
