    "intro": "Pterocephalus depressus var. rifanus, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including Tibet and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
