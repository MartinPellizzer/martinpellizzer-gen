    "intro": "Pedicularis lamarum, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
