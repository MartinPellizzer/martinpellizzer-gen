    "intro": "Polypodium alfredii, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium alfredii plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for various small organisms."
