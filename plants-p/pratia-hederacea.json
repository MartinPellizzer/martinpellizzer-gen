    "intro": "Pratia hederacea, commonly known as creeping blakea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, often covered in fine hairs. Pratia hederacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
