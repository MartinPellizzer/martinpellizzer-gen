    "intro": "Potameia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are encased in a hard, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Potameia velutina is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
