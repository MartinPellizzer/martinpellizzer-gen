    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 ontariensis, commonly known as the eastern cottonwood, is a hybrid species native to eastern North America. It is a large, fast-growing tree that typically reaches heights of 20 to 40 meters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Its rapid growth makes it useful for reforestation and erosion control."
