    "intro": "Pleopeltis maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a compact rosette structure with short, stout rhizomes and produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
