    "intro": "Poa nevadensis var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its leaves are smooth and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
