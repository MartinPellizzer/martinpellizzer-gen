    "intro": "Paepalanthus viridis, commonly known as the green puya, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
