    "intro": "Pothos microstachyus, commonly known as the marble queen pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers, though it is more prized for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos microstachyus is a low-maintenance plant that is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
