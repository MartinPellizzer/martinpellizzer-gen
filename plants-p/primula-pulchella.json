    "intro": "Primula pulchella, commonly known as the showy primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade and well-drained soil."
