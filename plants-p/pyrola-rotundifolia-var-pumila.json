    "intro": "Pyrola rotundifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with coniferous trees. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils."
