    "intro": "Pleurothallis longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging but rewarding plant for advanced orchid growers."
