    "intro": "Poa selemdzhensis, commonly known as the Selemdzha grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
