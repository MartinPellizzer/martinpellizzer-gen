It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and roadsides. The plant features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Pavonia scabra is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
