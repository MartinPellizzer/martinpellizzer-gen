    "intro": "Pholidota sororia, commonly known as the lesser flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pholidota sororia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant seasonal display."
