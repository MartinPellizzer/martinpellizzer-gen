    "intro": "Pleurothallis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating water retention in its humid habitat. Pleurothallis biflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
