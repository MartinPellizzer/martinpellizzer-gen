    "intro": "Polypodium podobasis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The rock fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
