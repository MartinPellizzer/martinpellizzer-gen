    "intro": "Psammogeton canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a fine layer of white pubescence, which reduces water loss. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in erosion control and forage in livestock systems."
