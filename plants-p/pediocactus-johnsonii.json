    "intro": "Pediocactus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches into a few short, thick ribs. Its spines are typically white to yellow and are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
