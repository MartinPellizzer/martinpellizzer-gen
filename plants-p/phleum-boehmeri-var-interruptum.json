    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
