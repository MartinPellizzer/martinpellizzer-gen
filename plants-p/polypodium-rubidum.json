    "intro": "Polypodium rubidum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium rubidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
