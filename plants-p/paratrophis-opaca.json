    "intro": "Paratrophis opaca, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with gray-green, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Paratrophis opaca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
