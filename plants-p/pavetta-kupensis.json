    "intro": "Pavetta kupensis, commonly known as the Kupensis pavetta, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains numerous seeds. Pavetta kupensis is often found in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
