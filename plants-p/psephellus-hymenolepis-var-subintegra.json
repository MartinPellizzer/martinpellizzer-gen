    "intro": "Psephellus hymenolepis var. subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
