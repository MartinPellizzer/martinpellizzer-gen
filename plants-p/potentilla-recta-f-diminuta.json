    "intro": "Potentilla recta f. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. The cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
