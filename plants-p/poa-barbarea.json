    "intro": "Poa barbarea, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa barbarea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
