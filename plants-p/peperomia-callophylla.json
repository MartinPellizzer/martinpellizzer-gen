    "intro": "Peperomia callophylla, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia callophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
