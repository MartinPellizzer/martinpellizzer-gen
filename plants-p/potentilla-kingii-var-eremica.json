    "intro": "Potentilla kingii var. eremica, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in drought-prone areas."
