    "intro": "Phymatopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine wall-rhizome fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense mats. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
