    "intro": "Primula viscosa var. major, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique adaptations, such as the sticky leaves, make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
