    "intro": "Pleopeltis triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
