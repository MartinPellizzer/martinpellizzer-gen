    "intro": "Pimelea imbricata var. petraea, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
