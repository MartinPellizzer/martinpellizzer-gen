    "intro": "Penstemon linarioides subsp. typicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The subspecies typicus is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated flower spikes compared to other Penstemon species."
