    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. glauca, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to salty and windy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in sandy or muddy areas along shorelines. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
