    "intro": "Pinus divaricata f. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping dwarf pine, is a naturally occurring variant of the creeping pine. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with dense foliage that cascades over the ground. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical species. It produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This form is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments."
