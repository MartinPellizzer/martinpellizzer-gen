    "intro": "Psychotria falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a distinctive, fleshy calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Psychotria falcata is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as harmine and harmaline."
