    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subvar. longicalycina, commonly known as the long calyx potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with elongated, glandular calyces, which are distinctive and contribute to its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subvariety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
