    "intro": "Polystichum mucronatum, commonly known as the blunt-tipped wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Polystichum mucronatum thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
