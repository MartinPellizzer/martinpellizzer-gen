    "intro": "Pagiantha koroana, commonly known as the Koroan wild orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pagiantha koroana is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
