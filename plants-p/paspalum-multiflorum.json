    "intro": "Paspalum multiflorum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its adaptability makes it a common species in wetland restoration projects."
