    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense rosette of narrow, pointed leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its cold-hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
