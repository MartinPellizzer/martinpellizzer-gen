It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
