    "intro": "Pteris grandifolia var. campanae, commonly known as the campanulate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive, campanulate (bell-shaped) fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically upright and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a feathery, bipinnate structure. It produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
