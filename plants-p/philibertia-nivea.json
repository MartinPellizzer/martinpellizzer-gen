    "intro": "Philibertia nivea, commonly known as the white filbert, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a husk, similar to those of the hazelnut. Philibertia nivea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Betulaceae family."
