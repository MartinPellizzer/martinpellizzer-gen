    "intro": "Pleopeltis glauca, commonly known as the blue moss fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds that are typically covered in a bluish waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pleopeltis glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
