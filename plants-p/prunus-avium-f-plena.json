    "intro": "Prunus avium f. plena, commonly known as the double cherry tree, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its dense, double flowers. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers with multiple petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical cherry blossoms. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. It bears edible fruit similar to common cherries, though the fruit may be smaller and less flavorful. This variety is prized for its showy blooms and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
