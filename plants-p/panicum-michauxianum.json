    "intro": "Panicum michauxianum, commonly known as Michaux's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland restoration projects."
