    "intro": "Phyllitis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate while also facilitating nutrient absorption. Phyllitis lancifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
