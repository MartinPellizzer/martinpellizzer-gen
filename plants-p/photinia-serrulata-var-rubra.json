    "intro": "Photinia serrulata var. rubra, commonly known as the red tip photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn a striking red during the growing season, particularly in spring. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its adaptability and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
