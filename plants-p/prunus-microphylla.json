    "intro": "Prunus microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Prunus microphylla is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various garden conditions."
