    "intro": "Pentatherum agrostidiforme, commonly known as the grass-like fern, is a unique plant with a distinctive morphology that combines features of both grasses and ferns. It belongs to the order Polypodiales and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, a feature typical of ferns. Despite its appearance, it is not a true grass but is often mistaken for one due to its similar growth habit."
