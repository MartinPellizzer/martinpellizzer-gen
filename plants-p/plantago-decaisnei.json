    "intro": "Plantago decaisnei, commonly known as the Decaisne's plantain, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
