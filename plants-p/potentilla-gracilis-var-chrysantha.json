It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a soft, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and compact form."
