It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, often aromatic leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and violet, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects.
