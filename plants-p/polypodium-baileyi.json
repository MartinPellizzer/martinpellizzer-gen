    "intro": "Polypodium baileyi, commonly known as the Mexican holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium baileyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense, foliage."
