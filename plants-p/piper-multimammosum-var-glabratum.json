    "intro": "Piper multimammosum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-hairy pepper, is a variant of the Piper multimammosum species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other variants of the species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species known for their aromatic properties. Due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal uses, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
