    "intro": "Polystichum excelcior, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, narrow fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in clusters. Polystichum excelcior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
