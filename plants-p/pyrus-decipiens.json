    "intro": "Pyrus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are often mistaken for true pears. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant can grow up to 10 feet tall. Pyrus decipiens is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
