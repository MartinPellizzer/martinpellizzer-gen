It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bats and insects. Its fruit, which resembles a pineapple, is edible and has a sweet, fibrous texture. The plant thrives in coastal and wetland environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
