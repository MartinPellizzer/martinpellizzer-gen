    "intro": "Pandanus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be used to make thatch, mats, and other woven items. The irregular pandanus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near water bodies."
