    "intro": "Pteris scolopendrina, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive, segmented appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some cultures."
