    "intro": "Pneumatopteris blastophora, commonly known as the air fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. The genus Pneumatopteris is distinguished by its specialized air pockets that aid in gas exchange, enhancing its adaptability to its habitat."
