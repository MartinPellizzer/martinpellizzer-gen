    "intro": "Pinalia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved pinalia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Pinalia microphylla is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates."
