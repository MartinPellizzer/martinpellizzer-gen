    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. polystachia, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
