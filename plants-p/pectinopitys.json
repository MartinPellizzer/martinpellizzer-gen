    "intro": "Pectinopitys, commonly known as the silver fir, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Pectinopitys are usually pendulous and can be either male or female, with the female cones producing seeds. The bark of these trees is often thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, Pectinopitys species play an important role in forest ecosystems."
