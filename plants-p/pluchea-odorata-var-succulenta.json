    "intro": "Pluchea odorata var. succulenta, commonly known as sweetroot or wild chicory, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which contributes to its drought tolerance. The leaves and roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
