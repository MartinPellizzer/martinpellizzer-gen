    "intro": "Piofontia rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Piofontia rupestris is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
