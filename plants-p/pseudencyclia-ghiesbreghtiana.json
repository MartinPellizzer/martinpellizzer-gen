    "intro": "Pseudencyclia ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it is pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
