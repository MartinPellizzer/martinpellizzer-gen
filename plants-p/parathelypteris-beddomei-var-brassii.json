    "intro": "Parathelypteris beddomei var. brassii, commonly known as the brassii variety of the beddome's shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The varietal distinction of brassii is based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and sporangium structure compared to the typical form."
