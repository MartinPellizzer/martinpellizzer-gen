    "intro": "Pleurothallis iota, commonly known as the silver-stem pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
