    "intro": "Phegopteris leptoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually bioluminescent and can be used as an indicator of water quality."
