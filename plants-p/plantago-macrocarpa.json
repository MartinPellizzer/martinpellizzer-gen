    "intro": "Plantago macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded plantain, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish flowers. After flowering, it develops distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woods."
