    "intro": "Panicum leibergii, commonly known as Leiberg's panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces small, pale green to golden brown florets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for native plant gardens and erosion control. Panicum leibergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
