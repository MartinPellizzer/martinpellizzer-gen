    "intro": "Polypodium lherminieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Polypodium lherminieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
