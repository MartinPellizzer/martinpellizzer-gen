    "intro": "Peperomia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slight pubescence, often displaying variegation in some cultivars. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it an ideal houseplant. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
