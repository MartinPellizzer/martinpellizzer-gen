    "intro": "Phreatia quinquelobulata, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive five-lobed structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Phreatia quinquelobulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
