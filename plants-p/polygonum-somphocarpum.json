    "intro": "Polygonum somphocarpum, commonly known as the golden goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Polygonum somphocarpum is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks."
