    "intro": "Pultenaea laxiflora var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate pultenaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions."
