    "intro": "Pilocosta nana, commonly known as the dwarf pilocosta, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the rocky and arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a compact growth habit that helps conserve water. Pilocosta nana is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
