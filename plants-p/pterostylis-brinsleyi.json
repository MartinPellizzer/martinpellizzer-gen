    "intro": "Pterostylis brinsleyi, commonly known as the Brinsley's helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often greenish-brown in color. The plant typically grows in dense, shaded understorey environments, often in rainforest or heathland. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the flower's strong, musty odor. The orchid has a short, erect stem with a single, upright flower at the top."
