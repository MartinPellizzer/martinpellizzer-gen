    "intro": "Petrocodon, commonly known as the rockflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its small, often blue or purple flowers and hairy leaves. These plants are typically found in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. Petrocodon species are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats."
