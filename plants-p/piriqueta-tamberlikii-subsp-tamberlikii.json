It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted to capture light efficiently in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
