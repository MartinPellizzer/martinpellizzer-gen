    "intro": "Parkinsonia peruviana, commonly known as the screwbean, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in desert landscapes. Parkinsonia peruviana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance in degraded areas."
