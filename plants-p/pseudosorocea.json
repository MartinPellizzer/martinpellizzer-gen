    "intro": "Pseudosorocea, commonly known as the false sorus, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically flattened and ribbon-like. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Pseudosorocea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They play a role in soil stabilization and contribute to the ecological diversity of their habitats."
