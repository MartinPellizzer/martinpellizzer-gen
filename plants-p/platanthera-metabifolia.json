    "intro": "Platanthera metabifolia, commonly known as the two-lobed lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that are arranged in a loose, loose, spiral-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with specific fungal mycorrhizal relationships. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it is listed as endangered in several states due to habitat loss and environmental changes. The plant's unique morphology and ecological requirements make it a significant species in the study of orchid biology and conservation."
