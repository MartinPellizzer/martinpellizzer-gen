    "intro": "Pyrethrum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes."
