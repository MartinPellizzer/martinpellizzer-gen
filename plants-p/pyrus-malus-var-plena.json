It is characterized by its abundant clusters of white or pink blossoms that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and can grow as a small tree or shrub. Its botanical features include small, oval leaves with serrated edges and a compact, rounded form. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
