    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. brevisetum, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, tufted clusters of fine, silver-green foliage that forms a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to greenish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in compact, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
