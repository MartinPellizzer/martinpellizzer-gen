    "intro": "Pennisetum molle, commonly known as silky blue oat grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its soft, silver-blue foliage and slender, arching stems that create a graceful, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy flower heads that resemble oat-like clusters, adding visual interest in late summer and autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Pennisetum molle is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
