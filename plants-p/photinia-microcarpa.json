    "intro": "Photinia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
