    "intro": "Polygala oberthueri, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, bean-like fruits that contain the seeds. Polygala oberthueri is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
