    "intro": "Panicum philadelphicum, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to heights of 3 to 6 feet and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces large, open panicles of small, beige to brown flowers in late summer to early fall. It is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its fibrous roots help prevent erosion, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
