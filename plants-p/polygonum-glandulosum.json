    "intro": "Polygonum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its upright stems that are often hairy, especially along the nodes. The leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating and small glands, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. This plant thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
