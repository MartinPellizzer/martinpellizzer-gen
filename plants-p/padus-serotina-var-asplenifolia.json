    "intro": "Padus serotina var. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of the maidenhair fern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
