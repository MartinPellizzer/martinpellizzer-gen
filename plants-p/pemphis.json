    "intro": "Pemphis, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to waterlogged soils. Pemphis species are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. They often have a trailing or creeping growth habit, making them suitable for erosion control in aquatic habitats. The genus includes several species, with Pemphis palustris being one of the most commonly recognized."
