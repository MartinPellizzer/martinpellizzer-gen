    "intro": "Pterolobium platypterum, commonly known as the flat-winged pterolobium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are legumes, containing several seeds, and it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Pterolobium platypterum is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, adapting well to dry and disturbed habitats."
