    "intro": "Polythecium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed polypody, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with smooth margins and a light green to pale yellowish hue. It produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions."
