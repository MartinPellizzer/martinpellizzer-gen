    "intro": "Plantago major subsp. rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Plantago genus."
