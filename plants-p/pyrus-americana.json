    "intro": "Pyrus americana, commonly known as the American crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Pyrus americana is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
