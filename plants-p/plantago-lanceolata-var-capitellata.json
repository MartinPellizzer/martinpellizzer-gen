    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. capitellata, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, greenish flowers at the center of the rosette, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
