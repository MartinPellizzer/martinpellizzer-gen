    "intro": "Potentilla thyrsiflora f. borosii, commonly known as the Borosii potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a dense, hairy covering that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
