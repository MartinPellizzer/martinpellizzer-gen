    "intro": "Parietaria officinalis var. diffusa, commonly known as smooth wallweed, is a variant of the common wall pennywort. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hairless structures, which contribute to its characteristic appearance. This variety is known for its adaptability and is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
