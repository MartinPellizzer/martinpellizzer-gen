    "intro": "Ponerorchis pauciflora var. joo-iokiana, commonly known as the Joo-Iokian ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a slender, wiry stem and few, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically clustered in small inflorescences and are noted for their intricate, almost translucent appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
