    "intro": "Passiflora foetida subsp. orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces small, orange-yellow berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
