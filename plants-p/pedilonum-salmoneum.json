    "intro": "Pedilonum salmoneum, commonly known as the golden foot plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and unique foot-like appendages on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Pedilonum salmoneum is considered a vulnerable species."
