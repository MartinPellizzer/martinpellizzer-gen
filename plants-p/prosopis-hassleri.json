    "intro": "Prosopis hassleri, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into small, narrow leaflets, and its distinctive, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Prosopis hassleri plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
