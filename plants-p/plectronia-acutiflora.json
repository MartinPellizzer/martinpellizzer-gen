It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
