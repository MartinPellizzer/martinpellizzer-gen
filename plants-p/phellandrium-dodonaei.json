It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a fragrant, honey-scented nectar that attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Phellandrium dodonaei is valued for its ecological role and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
