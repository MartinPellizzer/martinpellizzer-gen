    "intro": "Pedicularis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of the genus Rhododendron. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are opposite and often hairy, while its stems are flexible and can twist in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Pedicularis flexuosa is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or hemiparasitic relationships with other plants."
