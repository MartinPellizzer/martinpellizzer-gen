    "intro": "Penstemon eriantherus var. argillosus, commonly known as the clay penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or clay soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces striking tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
