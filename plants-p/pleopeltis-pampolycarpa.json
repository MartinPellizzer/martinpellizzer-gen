It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches. Its leaves are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Pleopeltis pampolycarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
