    "intro": "Penstemon filiformis, commonly known as the slender beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Penstemon filiformis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
