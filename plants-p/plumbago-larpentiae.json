    "intro": "Plumbago larpentiae, commonly known as the Cape plumbago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has small, simple leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The Cape plumbago is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
