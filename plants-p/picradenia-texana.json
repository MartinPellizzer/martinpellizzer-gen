    "intro": "Picradenia texana, commonly known as Texas prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often described as having a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
