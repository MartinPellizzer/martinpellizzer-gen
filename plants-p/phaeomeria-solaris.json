    "intro": "Phaeomeria solaris, commonly known as the sunbloom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sunlight and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Phaeomeria solaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
