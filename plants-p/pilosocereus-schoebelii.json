It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a vibrant, colorful crown atop a green, columnar stem. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the warmer months. Despite its striking appearance, it is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
