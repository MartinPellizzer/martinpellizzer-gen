    "intro": "Pausandra macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled pipsissewa, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features showy, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Pausandra macropetala is typically found in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments."
