    "intro": "Ptilocalyx greggii, commonly known as Gregg's ptilocalyx, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ptilocalyx greggii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
