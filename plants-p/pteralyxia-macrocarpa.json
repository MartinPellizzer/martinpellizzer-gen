    "intro": "Pteralyxia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited pteralyxia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
