It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
