    "intro": "Psorospermum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved psorospermum, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
