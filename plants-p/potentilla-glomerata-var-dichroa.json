    "intro": "Potentilla glomerata var. dichroa, commonly known as the dichroous potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface and a distinctive two-colored appearance, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
