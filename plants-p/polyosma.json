It consists of several species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are often glossy and have a distinctive veining pattern, while the fruits are small, three-lobed capsules.
