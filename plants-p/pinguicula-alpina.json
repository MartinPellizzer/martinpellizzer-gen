    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It possesses small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape. Pinguicula alpina is a perennial herb that relies on photosynthesis for energy, supplementing it with nutrients obtained from captured prey."
