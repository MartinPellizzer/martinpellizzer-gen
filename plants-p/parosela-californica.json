    "intro": "Parosela californica, commonly known as the California parosela, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
