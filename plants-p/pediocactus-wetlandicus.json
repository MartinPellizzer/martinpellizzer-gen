    "intro": "Pediocactus wetlandicus, commonly known as the wetland cactus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to moist, swampy environments. It features a short, columnar stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in waterlogged soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is found only in a few isolated wetlands in South America."
