    "intro": "Pilosella gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum hillflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, particularly on gypsum or limestone substrates, which influence its distribution and ecological niche. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance and helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Pilosella gypsicola is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas."
