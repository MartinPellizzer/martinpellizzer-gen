    "intro": "Pimpinella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cowparsley, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, fern-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods and are dispersed by wind. Pimpinella pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks."
