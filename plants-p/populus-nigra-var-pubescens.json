    "intro": "Populus nigra var. pubescens, commonly known as the European black poplar. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia, characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. The species is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and paper production."
