    "intro": "Pyrrosia splendens, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a striking, glossy appearance that makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
