    "intro": "Panicum sphagnicola, commonly known as the sphagnum panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and bog environments. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found growing in association with sphagnum moss. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the unique conditions of peatland ecosystems. It plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of these sensitive habitats."
