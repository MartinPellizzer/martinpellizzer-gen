    "intro": "Panicum arizonicum var. majus, commonly known as Arizona grass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens."
