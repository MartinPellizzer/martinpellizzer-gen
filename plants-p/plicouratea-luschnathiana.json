It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi-lobed or pinnatifid, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
