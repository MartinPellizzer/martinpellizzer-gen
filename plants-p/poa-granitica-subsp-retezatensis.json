    "intro": "Poa granitica subsp. retezatensis, commonly known as the Retezat mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
