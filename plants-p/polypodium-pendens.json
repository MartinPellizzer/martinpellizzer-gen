    "intro": "Polypodium pendens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil. The plant features long, arching fronds with a distinctive, slender, and often drooping appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Polypodium pendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
