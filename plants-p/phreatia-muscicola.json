    "intro": "Phreatia muscicola, commonly known as the musk orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant, and often yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in the late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its roots are often covered in a dense, moss-like growth, which helps in water retention. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its specialized relationship with certain mycorrhizal fungi."
