It is native to the Mediterranean region and includes several species that are often mistaken for true squill due to their similar appearance. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Paraquilegia species are herbaceous perennials that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
