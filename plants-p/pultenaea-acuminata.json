It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
