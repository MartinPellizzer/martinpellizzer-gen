    "intro": "Pellaea hastata, commonly known as the silver fir fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and thrive in woodland habitats. Pellaea hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
