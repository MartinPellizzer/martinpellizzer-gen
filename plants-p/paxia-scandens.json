    "intro": "Paxia scandens, commonly known as the climbing paxia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing or trailing along supports, and produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous seeds. Paxia scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
