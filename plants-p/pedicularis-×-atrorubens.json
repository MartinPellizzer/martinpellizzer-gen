    "intro": "Pedicularis \u00d7 atrorubens, commonly known as the purple monkeyflower, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, purple, and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-elevation ecosystems."
