    "intro": "Protea humiflora, commonly known as the coastal protea, is a striking South African plant characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is known for its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts that surround the true flowers, which are usually small and clustered. Protea humiflora is adapted to frequent fires, a common occurrence in its native habitat, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
