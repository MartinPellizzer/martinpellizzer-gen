It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to a limited geographic region, primarily found in the mountainous areas of Southeast Asia. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the plant's seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
