    "intro": "Polystichum lancilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with narrow, elongated lobes that give the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients in its natural habitat."
