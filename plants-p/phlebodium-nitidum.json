    "intro": "Phlebodium nitidum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
