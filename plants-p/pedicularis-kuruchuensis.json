    "intro": "Pedicularis kuruchuensis, commonly known as the Kuruchu lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes many species of louseworts known for their unique, often spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
