    "intro": "Pinanga rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to stream banks and rocky substrates. Pinanga rivularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
