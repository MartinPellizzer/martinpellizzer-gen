    "intro": "Platanthera orbiculata var. orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of ovate, dark green leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a spike of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet woodlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is listed as endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
