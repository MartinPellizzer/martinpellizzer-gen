It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas at high altitudes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Phleum alpinum subsp. rhaeticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
