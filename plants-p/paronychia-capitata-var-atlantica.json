    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pink to purple flowers clustered in dense heads. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
