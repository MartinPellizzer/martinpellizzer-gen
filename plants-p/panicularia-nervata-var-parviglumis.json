    "intro": "Panicularia nervata var. parviglumis, commonly known as the small-headed panicled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and prolonged blooming period."
