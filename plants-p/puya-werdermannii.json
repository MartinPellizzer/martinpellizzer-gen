It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
