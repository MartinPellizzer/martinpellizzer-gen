    "intro": "Pleopeltis rhynchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered in rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats."
