It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Proustia mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
