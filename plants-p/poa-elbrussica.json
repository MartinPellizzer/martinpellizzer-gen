    "intro": "Poa elbrussica, commonly known as the Elbrus grass, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine zones. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation. Due to its rarity, Poa elbrussica is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
