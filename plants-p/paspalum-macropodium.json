    "intro": "Paspalum macropodium, commonly known as large-fruited grass or broad-fruited paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with elongated, slender florets. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Paspalum macropodium is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
