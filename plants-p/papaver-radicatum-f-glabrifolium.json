    "intro": "Papaver radicatum f. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other poppy species. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
