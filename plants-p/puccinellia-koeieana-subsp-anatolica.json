    "intro": "Puccinellia koeieana subsp. anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
