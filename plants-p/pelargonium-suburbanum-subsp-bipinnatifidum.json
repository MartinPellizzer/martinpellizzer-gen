    "intro": "Pelargonium suburbanum subsp. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely dissected, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in temperate regions."
