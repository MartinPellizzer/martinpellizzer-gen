    "intro": "Polystichum horridipinnum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with fine, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, shield-like structure."
