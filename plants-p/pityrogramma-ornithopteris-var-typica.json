    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris var. typica, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, heart-shaped to ovate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting local biodiversity."
