    "intro": "Poa hydrophyla, commonly known as the water meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in riparian zones."
