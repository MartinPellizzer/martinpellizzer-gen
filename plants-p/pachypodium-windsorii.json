    "intro": "Pachypodium windsorii, commonly known as the Windsor bottle tree, is a striking succulent native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, a feature typical of arid environments. The plant has sparse, often spiny foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers during the dry season. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered threatened in the wild."
