    "intro": "Protorhus ibiyensis, commonly known as the Ibiy\u00e9n Forest Tree, is a rare tropical tree native to specific regions of West Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense rainforests, often growing along riverbanks or in swampy areas. Its fruit produces small, fibrous seeds that are dispersed by water, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Protorhus ibiyensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
