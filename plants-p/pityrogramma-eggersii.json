    "intro": "Pityrogramma eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption."
