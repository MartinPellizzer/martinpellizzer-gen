    "intro": "Pteris acutangula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Pteris acutangula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a houseplant."
