    "intro": "Pilosella mollicaulis subsp. bauhiniflora, commonly known as the woolly leaf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a creeping growth habit, often spreading along the ground. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
