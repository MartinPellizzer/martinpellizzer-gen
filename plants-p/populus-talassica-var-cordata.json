    "intro": "Populus talassica var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a cotton-like covering, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age."
