    "intro": "Potentilla zimmeteri, commonly known as the Zimmeter's cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
