It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is known for its distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds."
