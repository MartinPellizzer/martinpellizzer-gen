    "intro": "Puya cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, bearing vibrant red flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
