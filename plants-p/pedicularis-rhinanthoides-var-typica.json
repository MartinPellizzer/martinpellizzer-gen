    "intro": "Pedicularis rhinanthoides var. typica, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system."
