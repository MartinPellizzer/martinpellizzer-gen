    "intro": "Peristima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Peristima is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an invasive species in many regions."
