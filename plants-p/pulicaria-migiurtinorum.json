    "intro": "Pulicaria migiurtinorum, commonly known as the Ethiopian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with grayish-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Pulicaria migiurtinorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
