    "intro": "Paphiopedilum praestans var. bicornutum, commonly known as the Bicornuate Paphiopedilum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated lip that features two prominent notches, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
