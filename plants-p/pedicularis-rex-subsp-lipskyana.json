    "intro": "Pedicularis rex subsp. lipskyana, commonly known as the King's Beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, and it thrives in alpine environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
