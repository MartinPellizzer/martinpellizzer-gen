It is a herbaceous perennial that features rosettes of round, fleshy leaves resembling coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pilea pentasepala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
