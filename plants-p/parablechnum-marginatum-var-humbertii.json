    "intro": "Parablechnum marginatum var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, fleshy foliage with a distinctive blue-green hue, often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
