    "intro": "Paspalum perrottetii, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing soil in moist environments."
