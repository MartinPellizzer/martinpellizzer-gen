    "intro": "Polygonum subaphyllum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Polygonum subaphyllum is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed or saturated soils, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
