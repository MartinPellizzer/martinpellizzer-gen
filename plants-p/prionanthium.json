    "intro": "Prionanthium, commonly known as the \"Hawaiian moonflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. These plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Prionanthium species are typically shrubs or small trees with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow blossoms. They are adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many species within this genus are critically endangered."
