    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. sylvestris, commonly known as wild apple, is a subspecies of the apple tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems, and its leaves are oval with a serrated edge. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve the resilience of cultivated apple varieties."
