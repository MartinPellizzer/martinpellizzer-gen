    "intro": "Pterodon apparicioi, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its high-quality timber, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
