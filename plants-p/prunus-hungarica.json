It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but have a more tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus hungarica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
