    "intro": "Potentilla monanthes var. alata, commonly known as the winged potentilla, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features distinctive, narrow leaves with a slightly winged appearance on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
