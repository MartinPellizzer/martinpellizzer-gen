    "intro": "Patagonium uspallatense, commonly known as the Uspallata thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh climate of Patagonia. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
