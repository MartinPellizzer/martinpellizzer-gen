It is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its spiny stems and unique floral structures. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid habitat. The botanical features of this species make it a notable subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
