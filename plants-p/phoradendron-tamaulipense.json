    "intro": "Phoradendron tamaulipense, commonly known as the Tamaulipan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects, facilitating pollination. Its berries are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the structure and diversity of forest ecosystems."
