    "intro": "Pandanus microstigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, which is surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, swampy environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional crafts."
