    "intro": "Pelargonium bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the double-leaf geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely dissected, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden beds and containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for decorative purposes in both indoor and outdoor settings."
