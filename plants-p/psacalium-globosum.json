    "intro": "Psacalium globosum, commonly known as the globe soursop, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Annonaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces a fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The plant is native to regions in South America and is often found in humid, tropical climates. Its fruit is edible, though it contains a hard, inedible seed at the center. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
