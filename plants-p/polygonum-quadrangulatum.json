    "intro": "Polygonum quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-angle knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its square, angular stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
