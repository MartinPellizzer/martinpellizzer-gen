    "intro": "Pteris dominicensis, commonly known as the Dominica water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
