    "intro": "Pterospermum suberifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved pterospermum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
