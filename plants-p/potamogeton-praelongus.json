    "intro": "Potamogeton praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often found near the water surface. Potamogeton praelongus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and canals."
