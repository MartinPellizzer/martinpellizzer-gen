    "intro": "Phragmites congestus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of leaves and its ability to form extensive stands in marshes, swamps, and along shorelines. The plant has hollow, jointed stems that are often used in traditional crafts and construction. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce a large amount of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Phragmites congestus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
