    "intro": "Passiflora calcicola, commonly known as the limestone passionflower, is a rare and specialized species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers with intricate structures that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in limestone-rich soils, which influence its growth patterns and distribution. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
