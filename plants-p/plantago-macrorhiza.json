    "intro": "Plantago macrorhiza, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
