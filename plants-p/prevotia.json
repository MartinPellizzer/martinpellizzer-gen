    "intro": "Prevotia, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and violet. Prevotia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. They also play a role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
