    "intro": "Paspalum melanospermum, commonly known as blackseed grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark, almost black seeds that are highly valued in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience. The flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain the distinctive black seeds."
