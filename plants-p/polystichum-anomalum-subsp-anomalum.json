    "intro": "Polystichum anomalum subsp. anomalum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped leaflets. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
