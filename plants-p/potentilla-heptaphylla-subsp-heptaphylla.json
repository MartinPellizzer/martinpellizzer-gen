    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla subsp. heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has dark green, elliptical leaves arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
