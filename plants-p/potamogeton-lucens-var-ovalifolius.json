    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically oval in shape, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially emergent. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished from other forms of Potamogeton lucens by its distinctly oval leaf shape and growth habits."
