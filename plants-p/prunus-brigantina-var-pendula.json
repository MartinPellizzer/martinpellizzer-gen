    "intro": "Prunus brigantina var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a waterfall. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, which are followed by edible drupes. Its unique form makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and seasonal interest throughout the year."
