    "intro": "Pitcairnia minarum, commonly known as the Mountain Pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or red. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
