    "intro": "Potentilla jepsonii, commonly known as Jepson's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
