    "intro": "Pogonopus febrifugus var. macrosema, commonly known as the large-seeded fevergrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a robust, fibrous root system and erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in local remedies for fever and inflammatory conditions."
