    "intro": "Phegopteris auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble ears, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris auriculata plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
