    "intro": "Pleopeltis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped spore-producing structures on the underside."
