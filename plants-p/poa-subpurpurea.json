    "intro": "Poa subpurpurea, commonly known as purple meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink hues. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Poa subpurpurea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
