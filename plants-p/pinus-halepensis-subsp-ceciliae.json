    "intro": "Pinus halepensis subsp. ceciliae, commonly known as the Cretan pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical *Pinus halepensis*. The cones of this subspecies are distinctive, often featuring a unique shape and size compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
