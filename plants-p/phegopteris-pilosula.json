    "intro": "Phegopteris pilosula, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris pilosula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
