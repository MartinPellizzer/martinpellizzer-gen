    "intro": "Pisonia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seed pods that disperse seeds via wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Pisonia cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
