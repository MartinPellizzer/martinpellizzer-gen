    "intro": "Pyrrosia acrostichoides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape."
