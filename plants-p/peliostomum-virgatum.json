    "intro": "Peliostomum virgatum, commonly known as the water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are floating or submerged, depending on the water level, and it has a rhizomatous root system. Peliostomum virgatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
