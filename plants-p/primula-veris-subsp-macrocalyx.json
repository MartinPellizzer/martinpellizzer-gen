    "intro": "Primula veris subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the greater cowslip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical P. veris."
