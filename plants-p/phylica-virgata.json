    "intro": "Phylica virgata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The silver tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance."
