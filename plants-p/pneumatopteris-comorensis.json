    "intro": "Pneumatopteris comorensis, commonly known as the Comoro water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are composed of small, serrated pinnae that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange."
