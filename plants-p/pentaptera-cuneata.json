    "intro": "Pentaptera cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pentaptera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
