    "intro": "Polypodium falcaria, commonly known as the running polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a lanceolate shape and serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces spores in sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds."
