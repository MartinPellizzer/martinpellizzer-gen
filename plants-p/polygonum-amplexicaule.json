    "intro": "Polygonum amplexicaule, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and spread along the ground. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum amplexicaule is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and stream banks."
