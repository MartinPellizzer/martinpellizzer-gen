    "intro": "Paspalum arenicola, commonly known as beach paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it helps stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Its resilience and adaptability make it an important species in coastal ecology."
