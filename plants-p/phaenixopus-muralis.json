    "intro": "Phaenixopus muralis, commonly known as the wall ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for covering walls and trellises. However, it can become invasive if not controlled, posing a challenge in garden management."
