It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
