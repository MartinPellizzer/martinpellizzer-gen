    "intro": "Paullinia erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited soursop, is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into large, spiny fruits with a distinctive red, bumpy exterior. The fruit contains a single large, inedible seed surrounded by a soft, sweet pulp that is often consumed. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
