    "intro": "Phanerophlebiopsis kweichowensis, commonly known as the Kweichow fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
