    "intro": "Pimpinella cartilaginomarginata, commonly known as the cartilage-margin angelica, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of the carrot family. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae group. It is native to specific regions in southern China and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
