    "intro": "Phelline indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phelline, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. It is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, arranged in clusters, and the pods are slender and woody. Phelline indivisa is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
