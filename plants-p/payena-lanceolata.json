    "intro": "Payena lanceolata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
