    "intro": "Prunus nana proles georgica, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or George's dwarf cherry, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions for ornamental purposes."
