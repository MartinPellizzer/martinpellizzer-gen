    "intro": "Primula longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are elongated and often arching, which gives it a distinctive, graceful appearance. Primula longiscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
