    "intro": "Pyrus mergenthaleriana, commonly known as the Mergenthaler pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
