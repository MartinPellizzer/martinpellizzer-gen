    "intro": "Psoralea swartbergensis, commonly known as the Swartberg psoralea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
