    "intro": "Picris oreophila, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its yellowish flowers appear in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Picris oreophila is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
