It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Paspalum semirugosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
