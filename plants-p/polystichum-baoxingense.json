    "intro": "Polystichum baoxingense, commonly known as the Baoxing fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically grouped in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
