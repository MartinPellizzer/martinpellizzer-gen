    "intro": "Pouzolzia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pouzolzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine trichomes. Pouzolzia tomentosa is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing in dune environments."
