    "intro": "Peltogyne amplissima, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
