    "intro": "Phagnalon linnaeanum, commonly known as the Linnaean phagnalon, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed or marginal areas. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
