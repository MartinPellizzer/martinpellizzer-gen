    "intro": "Psychotria mindoroensis, commonly known as Mindoro Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
