It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of pale pink to white flowers in early spring. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn a striking red or orange in the fall. This form is a natural variant of the Japanese cherry, valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
