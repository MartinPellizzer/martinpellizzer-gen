    "intro": "Prosthechea terassaniana, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, filamentous pseudobulbs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a common feature in orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Prosthechea terassaniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
