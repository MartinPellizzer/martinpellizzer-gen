    "intro": "Phlegmariurus linifolius var. jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The leaves are often curled when dry and straighten when moist, a common feature in many mosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. This variety is distinguished by its finely textured leaves and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
