It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its slender, upright stems. This fern-like plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections. The plant exhibits a clumping growth habit and is relatively low maintenance once established."
