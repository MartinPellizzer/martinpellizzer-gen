    "intro": "Polypodium dolichopodum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a distinctive, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its lush, evergreen foliage."
