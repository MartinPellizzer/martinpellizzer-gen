    "intro": "Paradisea lusitanica var. transmontana, commonly known as the Transmontana lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a distinctive fragrance that attracts pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
