    "intro": "Papaver staintonii, commonly known as Stainton's poppy, is a rare and striking herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a short, upright stem with broad, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
