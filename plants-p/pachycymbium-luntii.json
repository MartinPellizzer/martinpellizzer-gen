    "intro": "Pachycymbium luntii, commonly known as the Lunt's thick-leafed cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered in its natural range."
