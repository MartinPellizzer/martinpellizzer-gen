    "intro": "Pandanus siamensis, commonly known as the Siam pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, which are edible and used in local cuisines. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in sandy or muddy soils. The Siam pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
