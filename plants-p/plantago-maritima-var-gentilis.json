    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. gentilis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the shorelines of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This variety is well adapted to maritime climates and is considered a hardy, salt-tolerant species."
