    "intro": "Pentaphalangium latissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf starfruit, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling small star-shaped berries. Its ornamental value is significant due to its striking foliage and unique fruit structure. However, the plant is also noted for its potential toxicity, as some parts contain irritants that can cause skin reactions."
