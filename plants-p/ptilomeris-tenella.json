    "intro": "Ptilomeris tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ptilomeris, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
