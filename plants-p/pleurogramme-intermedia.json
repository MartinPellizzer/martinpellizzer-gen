    "intro": "Pleurogramme intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
