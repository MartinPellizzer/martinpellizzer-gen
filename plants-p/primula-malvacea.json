    "intro": "Primula malvacea, commonly known as the marsh primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is an important indicator species for aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
