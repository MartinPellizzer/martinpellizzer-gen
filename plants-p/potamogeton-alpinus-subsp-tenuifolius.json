    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus subsp. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, temperate regions. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, arranged in whorls along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with staminate and pistillate flowers on separate plants. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its morphology is adapted for underwater growth, with a robust rhizome system for anchoring and nutrient absorption."
