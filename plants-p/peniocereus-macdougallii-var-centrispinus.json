    "intro": "Peniocereus macdougallii var. centrispinus, commonly known as the Centrispine prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is particularly notable for its distinctive, spiny appearance and its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
