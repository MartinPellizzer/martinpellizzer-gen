    "intro": "Paraboea apiensis, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the cool, humid environments of cloud forests. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink. Paraboea apiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique beauty."
