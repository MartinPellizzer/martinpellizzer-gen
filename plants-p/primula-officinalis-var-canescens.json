It features hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued in traditional herbal medicine."
