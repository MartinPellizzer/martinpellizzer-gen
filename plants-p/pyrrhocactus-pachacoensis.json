    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus pachacoensis, commonly known as the Pachacoensis Pyrrhocactus, is a species of cactus native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but vibrant. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation in arid environments. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
