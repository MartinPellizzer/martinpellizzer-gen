    "intro": "Platycentrum robustum, commonly known as the robust flatcentrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
