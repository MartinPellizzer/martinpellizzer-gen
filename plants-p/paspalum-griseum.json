    "intro": "Paspalum griseum, commonly known as gray paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Gray paspalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
