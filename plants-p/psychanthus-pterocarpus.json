    "intro": "Psychanthus pterocarpus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
