    "intro": "Papaver somniferum subvar. atroviolaceum, commonly known as the dark violet opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its deep violet to almost black petals. It is native to regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated for its latex, which contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and produces striking flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, alternate leaves, and a capsule-like fruit that splits open to release the seeds. Due to its association with opiate production, it is subject to strict legal regulation in many countries."
