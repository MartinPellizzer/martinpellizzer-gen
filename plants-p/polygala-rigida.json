    "intro": "Polygala rigida, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Polygala rigida is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
