    "intro": "Paronychia litoralis, commonly known as sea beach grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Paronychia litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
