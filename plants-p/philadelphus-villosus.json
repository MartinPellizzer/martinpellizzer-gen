It is characterized by its dense, arching clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has grayish-white, hairy stems and heart-shaped, toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its showy flowers attract pollinators, contributing to both aesthetic and ecological value in gardens."
