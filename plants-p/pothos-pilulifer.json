    "intro": "Pothos pilulifer, commonly known as the bead vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of round, bead-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens."
