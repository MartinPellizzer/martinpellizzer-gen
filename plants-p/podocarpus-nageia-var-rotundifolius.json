    "intro": "Podocarpus nageia var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf podocarp, is a species of coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces distinctive, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
