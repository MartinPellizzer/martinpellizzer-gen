It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy texture, while its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences.
