It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pagamea aracaensis is considered an endangered species."
