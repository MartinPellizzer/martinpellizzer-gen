    "intro": "Potentilla micheneri, commonly known as the Michener cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, mountainous climates. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potentilla micheneri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
