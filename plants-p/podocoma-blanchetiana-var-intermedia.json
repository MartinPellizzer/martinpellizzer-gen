    "intro": "Podocoma blanchetiana var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
