    "intro": "Panax japonicus f. incisus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng or Korean ginseng, is a variant of the Panax genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in forested regions with moist, well-drained soil. It is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
