    "intro": "Primula egaliksensis, commonly known as the Egalik primrose, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of northern Canada and Alaska. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
