    "intro": "Poterium muricatum subsp. verrucosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water filtration."
