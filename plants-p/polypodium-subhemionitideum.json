    "intro": "Polypodium subhemionitideum, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a rhizome that is covered with a layer of brown, leathery scales, and its leaves are typically lanceolate with a serrated margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
