    "intro": "Potentilla sericea var. compacta, commonly known as silver sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
