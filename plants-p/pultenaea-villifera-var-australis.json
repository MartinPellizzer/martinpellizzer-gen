It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects."
