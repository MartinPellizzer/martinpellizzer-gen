    "intro": "Pilosella fennica subsp. exorrhabda, commonly known as the Fennoscandian pilosella, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are hairy and linear, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a compact head. It is a perennial herb that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements."
