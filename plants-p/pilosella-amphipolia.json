    "intro": "Pilosella amphipolia, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Pilosella amphipolia is often found in open meadows and on slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
