    "intro": "Phidiasia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Phidiasia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can also serve as food sources for certain insects."
