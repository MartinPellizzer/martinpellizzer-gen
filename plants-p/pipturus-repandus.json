    "intro": "Pipturus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaf holly or broadleaf privet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
