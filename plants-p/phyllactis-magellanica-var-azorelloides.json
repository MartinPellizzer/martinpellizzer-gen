    "intro": "Phyllactis magellanica var. azorelloides, commonly known as the Azorean milkweed, is a rare and unique variant of the genus Phyllactis. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Apocynaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually alternate and oval-shaped, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
