    "intro": "Pteroceras pustulatum, commonly known as the blistered clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is notable for its spore-bearing structures, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
