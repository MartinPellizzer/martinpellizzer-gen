    "intro": "Protium cornutum, commonly known as the horned tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface, while its bark is smooth and light brown in color. Protium cornutum is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
