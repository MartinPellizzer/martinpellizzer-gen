    "intro": "Philodendron guttiferum var. martini, commonly known as the Martian Philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive red or purple stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
