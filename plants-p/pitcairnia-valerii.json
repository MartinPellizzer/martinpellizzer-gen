    "intro": "Pitcairnia valerii, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a soft, velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low light and its minimal water requirements."
