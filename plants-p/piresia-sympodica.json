    "intro": "Piresia sympodica, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Piresia sympodica is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
