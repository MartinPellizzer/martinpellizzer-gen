    "intro": "Petronymphe rara, commonly known as the rare moonflower of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blossoms that open only at night and emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing and wilting. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, Petronymphe rara is considered an endangered species."
