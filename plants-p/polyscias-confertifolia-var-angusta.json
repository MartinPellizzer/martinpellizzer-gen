It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are narrower than the standard variety, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is prized for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
