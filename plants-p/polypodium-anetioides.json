    "intro": "Polypodium anetioides, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are pinnately compound. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium anetioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
