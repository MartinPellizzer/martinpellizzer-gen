It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its flowers are small and clustered in a loose, open arrangement. Perotis leptopus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
