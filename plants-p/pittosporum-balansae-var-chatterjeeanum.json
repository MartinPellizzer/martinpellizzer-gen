    "intro": "Pittosporum balansae var. chatterjeeanum, commonly known as the Chatterjee's pittosporum, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by a strong, spicy aroma. The plant has elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native region."
