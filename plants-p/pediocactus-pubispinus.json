    "intro": "Pediocactus pubispinus, commonly known as the hairy prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. Pediocactus pubispinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in drought conditions."
