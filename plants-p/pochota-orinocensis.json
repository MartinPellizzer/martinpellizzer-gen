    "intro": "Pochota orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco pochota, is a species of legume native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, well-drained soils near riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
