    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pseudophegopteris henriquesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
