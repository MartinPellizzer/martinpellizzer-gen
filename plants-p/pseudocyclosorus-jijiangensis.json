    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus jijiangensis, commonly known as the Jijiang water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Water Fern Family (Hydropteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
