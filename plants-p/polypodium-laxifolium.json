    "intro": "Polypodium laxifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Polypodium laxifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
