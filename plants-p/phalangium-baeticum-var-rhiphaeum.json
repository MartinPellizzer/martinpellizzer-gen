    "intro": "Phalangium baeticum var. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the Baetican phalangium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, sometimes spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
