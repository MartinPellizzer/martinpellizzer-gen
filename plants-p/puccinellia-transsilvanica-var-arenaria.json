    "intro": "Puccinellia transsilvanica var. arenaria, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and dry meadows. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
