    "intro": "Peperomia litana, commonly known as the Litana peppergrass, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to South America. It features dense, waxy foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
