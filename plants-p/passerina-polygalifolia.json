It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals that bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
