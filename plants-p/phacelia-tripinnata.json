    "intro": "Phacelia tripinnata, commonly known as blue flax, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are opposite and pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Phacelia tripinnata is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to attract pollinators and its adaptability to various soil types."
