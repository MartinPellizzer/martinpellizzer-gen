    "intro": "Pandanus gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Central and Western Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are robust and have a fibrous texture, making them useful for weaving and thatching. Pandanus gabonensis thrives in humid, coastal or lowland forest environments."
