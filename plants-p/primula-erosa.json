    "intro": "Primula erosa, commonly known as the pink primrose, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a wavy margin and are covered in fine hairs. Primula erosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
