    "intro": "Pyragra obtusifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pyragra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
