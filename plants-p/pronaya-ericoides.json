    "intro": "Pronaya ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are small, tubular, and often pink or red, blooming in clusters during the warmer months. Pronaya ericoides is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments."
