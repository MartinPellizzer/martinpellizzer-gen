    "intro": "Perebea guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese perebea, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
