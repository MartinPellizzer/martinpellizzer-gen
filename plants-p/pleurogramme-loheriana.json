    "intro": "Pleurogramme loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's pleurogramme, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
