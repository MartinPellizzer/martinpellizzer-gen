    "intro": "Panicum multiculmum, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often display a striking purple hue. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and disturbed habitats. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage crop for livestock."
