    "intro": "Pyrus spinosa, commonly known as the common spindle. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its spiny branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruit, a small, sour apple, is edible but often used in jams and preserves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
