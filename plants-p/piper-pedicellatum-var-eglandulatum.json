    "intro": "Piper pedicellatum var. eglandulatum, commonly known as the glandular pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are a distinguishing feature of this variant."
