    "intro": "Poikilogyne neglecta, commonly known as the neglected leaf plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread via rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in shaded garden settings."
