    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan feather-fern, is a member of the water fern family, Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often divided into small, feather-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. The species is native to South America, particularly the Guianas and parts of Brazil."
