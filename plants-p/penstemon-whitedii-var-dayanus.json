It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
