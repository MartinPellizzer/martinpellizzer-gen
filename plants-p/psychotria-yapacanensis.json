It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Psychotria yapacanensis is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
