    "intro": "Polypodium maximowiczii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
