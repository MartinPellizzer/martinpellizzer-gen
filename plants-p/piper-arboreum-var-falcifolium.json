    "intro": "Piper arboreum var. falcifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that transition from green to red as they mature. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and, in some regions, for its edible fruits. The species is closely related to other Piper species used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
