    "intro": "Pyrrosia ensata, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia ensata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
