    "intro": "Prestonia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant poinciana, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates. However, it is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
