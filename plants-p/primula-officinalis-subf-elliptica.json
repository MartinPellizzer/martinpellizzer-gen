    "intro": "Primula officinalis subf. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular at the base and gradually widen, making it attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
