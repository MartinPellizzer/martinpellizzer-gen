    "intro": "Perfoliata rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed perfoliate, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rounded, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
