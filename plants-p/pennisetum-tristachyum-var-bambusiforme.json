It features tall, slender stems that resemble bamboo, growing up to 6 feet in height, with long, feathery plumes that sway gracefully in the wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its unique form and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for adding visual interest to ornamental gardens."
