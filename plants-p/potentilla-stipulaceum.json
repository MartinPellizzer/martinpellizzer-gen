    "intro": "Potentilla stipulaceum, commonly known as the stipule cinquefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically divided into five leaflets, giving it the common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. The stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks, are a distinctive feature of this species."
