    "intro": "Platantheroides quadrata, commonly known as the quadrata orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
