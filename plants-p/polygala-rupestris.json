    "intro": "Polygala rupestris, commonly known as the rock polygala, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Polygala rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
