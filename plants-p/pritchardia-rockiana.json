    "intro": "Pritchardia rockiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, tree-like palm that typically grows in rocky coastal areas and dry forests. The plant has a slender trunk and produces clusters of feather-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by bright orange or red fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Pritchardia rockiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
