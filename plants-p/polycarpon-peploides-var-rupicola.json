    "intro": "Polycarpon peploides var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
