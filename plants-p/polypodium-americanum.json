    "intro": "Polypodium americanum, commonly known as the American holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are often divided into segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance."
