    "intro": "Picrasma mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bitterleaf, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Simarouba family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a rough, often pubescent texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves and roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
