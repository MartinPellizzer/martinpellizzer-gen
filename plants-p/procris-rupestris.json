    "intro": "Procris rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Procris rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
