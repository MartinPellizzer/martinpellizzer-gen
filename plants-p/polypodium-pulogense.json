    "intro": "Polypodium pulogense, commonly known as the Bornean wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium pulogense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
