    "intro": "Parinari insularum, commonly known as the island parinari, is a tropical tree native to several island groups in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is typically found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, warm climates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Parinari insularum is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
