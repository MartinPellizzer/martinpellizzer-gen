    "intro": "Phreatia asciiformis, commonly known as the asciiform ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
