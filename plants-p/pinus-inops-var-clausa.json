    "intro": "Pinus inops var. clausa, commonly known as the closed-cone pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded cones that remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pinyon pines, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
