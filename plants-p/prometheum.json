    "intro": "Prometheum, commonly known as the fireflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features striking red and orange petals that resemble flames, hence its evocative name. The plant thrives in full sunlight and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Its unique appearance has made it a subject of fascination in both botany and folklore. Due to its rarity, Prometheum is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
