    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean maidenhair fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Azores. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
