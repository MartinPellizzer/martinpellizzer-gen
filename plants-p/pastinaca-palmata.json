    "intro": "Pastinaca palmata, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It has large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with showy spadices, which are typically borne on long, leafless stems. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines. The species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
