    "intro": "Proctoria caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Cayman Islands. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring thick, fleshy stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically from November to March. Proctoria caymanensis is adapted to the arid and rocky habitats of its native environment, showing resilience to drought and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
