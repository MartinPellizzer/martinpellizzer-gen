    "intro": "Polypodium velatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium velatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
