    "intro": "Polystichum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are adorned with distinctive white margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Polystichum albomarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
