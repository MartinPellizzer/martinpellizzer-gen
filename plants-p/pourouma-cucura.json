    "intro": "Pourouma cucura, commonly known as the yellow siphonophore or yellow manioc, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in panicles. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. However, the plant contains cyanogenic glycosides, making it toxic unless properly processed."
