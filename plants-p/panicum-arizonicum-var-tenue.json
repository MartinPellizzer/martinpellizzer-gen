    "intro": "Panicum arizonicum var. tenue, commonly known as Arizona grass or slender panicgrass, is a native grass species found in the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
