    "intro": "Phegopteris biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Phegopteris biformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
