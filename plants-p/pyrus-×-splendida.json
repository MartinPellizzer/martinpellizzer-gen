    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 splendida, commonly known as the golden-horned pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus betulaefolia (Chinese white pear). It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow foliage that turns orange-red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically not cultivated for commercial use but are appreciated for their unique flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The tree is relatively disease-resistant and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
