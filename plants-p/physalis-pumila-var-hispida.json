    "intro": "Physalis pumila var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy ground cherry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features prostrate stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, papery capsules containing orange-red berries. These berries are often eaten raw or used in culinary applications due to their tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
