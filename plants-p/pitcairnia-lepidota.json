    "intro": "Pitcairnia lepidota, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are often a deep green to reddish-purple in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom sequentially over several months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
