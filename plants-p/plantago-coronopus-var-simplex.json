It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
