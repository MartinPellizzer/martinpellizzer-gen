    "intro": "Prioria pinnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
