    "intro": "Polemonium hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in cold, rocky, and moist environments, often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, helping to retain moisture in harsh climates. The species is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
