    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. nitidula, commonly known as the glossy blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval leaves that are glossy on both sides. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by black, inedible berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
