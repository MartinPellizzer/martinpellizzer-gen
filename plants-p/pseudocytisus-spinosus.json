    "intro": "Pseudocytisus spinosus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
