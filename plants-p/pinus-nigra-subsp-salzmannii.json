    "intro": "Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark bark, needle-like leaves, and conical shape. This evergreen tree typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, thriving in well-drained soils. Its cones are serotinous, releasing seeds only after exposure to heat, often from forest fires. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
