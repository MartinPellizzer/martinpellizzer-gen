It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its capsule fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. Physaria pulchella is often found in rocky or sandy areas, where it thrives in full sun."
