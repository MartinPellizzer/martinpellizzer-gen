    "intro": "Pyrus floribunda, commonly known as the Japanese white pear, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring clusters of fragrant white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy green upper surface with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are not typically edible but are used in traditional Japanese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
