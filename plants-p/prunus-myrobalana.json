    "intro": "Prunus myrobalana, commonly known as the Persian lilac or Indian plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically edible, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Prunus myrobalana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
