    "intro": "Platanthera florentii, commonly known as the Florentine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
