It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white flowers. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous seeds, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
