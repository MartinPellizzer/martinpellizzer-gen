    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum milfordense, commonly known as the Milford lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are borne in clusters on slender stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
