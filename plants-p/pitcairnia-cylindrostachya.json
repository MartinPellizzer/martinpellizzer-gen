    "intro": "Pitcairnia cylindrostachya, commonly known as the cylinder-stemmed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, tubular flowers that attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species within the Bromeliaceae family."
