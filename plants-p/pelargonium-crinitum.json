    "intro": "Pelargonium crinitum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features hairy, fleshy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. Pelargonium crinitum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
