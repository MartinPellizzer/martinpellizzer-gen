    "intro": "Pogonia chariensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Its unique morphology includes a single, slender stem with a single flower at the top, and it lacks leaves, relying on its roots for nutrients. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia chariensis is considered critically endangered, making it a focus of conservation efforts."
