    "intro": "Polypodium villosissimum var. majus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on rocky or wooded substrates. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, aiding in water retention and nutrient absorption. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is not well-documented in var. majus."
