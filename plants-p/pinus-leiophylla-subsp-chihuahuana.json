    "intro": "Pinus leiophylla subsp. chihuahuana, commonly known as the Chihuahua pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Chihuahua region of northern Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a tall, straight trunk and a conical crown, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
