    "intro": "Prasium majus var. minus, commonly known as the lesser giant fern, is a variant of the giant fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
