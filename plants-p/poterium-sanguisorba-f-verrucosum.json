    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba f. verrucosum, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a variant of the species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and spikes of small, reddish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties. The f. verrucosum form is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical form."
