    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa, commonly known as the empress tree or princess tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for crafting and furniture. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal."
