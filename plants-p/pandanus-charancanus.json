It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline. The red pandanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional crafts and for its fibrous leaves."
