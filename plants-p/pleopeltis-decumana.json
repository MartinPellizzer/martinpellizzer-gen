    "intro": "Pleopeltis decumana, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, broad shape that distinguishes it from other fern species."
