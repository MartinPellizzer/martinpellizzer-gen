    "intro": "Paspalum lacustre, commonly known as water paspalum, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in the Americas. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, spreading stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Paspalum lacustre plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
