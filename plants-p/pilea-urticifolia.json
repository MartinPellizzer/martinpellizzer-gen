It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its stinging hairs, it requires careful handling to avoid irritation."
