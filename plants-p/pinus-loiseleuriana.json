    "intro": "Pinus loiseleuriana, commonly known as the Loiseleur's pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this species are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
