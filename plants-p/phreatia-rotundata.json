    "intro": "Phreatia rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth. Phreatia rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
