    "intro": "Phebalium graniticola, commonly known as the granite peacock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the granite outcrops of Western Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, peacock-like flowers that display a range of colors from purple to pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful management to ensure its survival."
