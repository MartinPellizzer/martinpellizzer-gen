    "intro": "Pinus armandi var. mastersiana, commonly known as the Masters' pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Chinese red pine. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical species. The cones are small and woody, typically maturing to a reddish-brown color. This variety is native to a limited geographic region in China, where it thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
