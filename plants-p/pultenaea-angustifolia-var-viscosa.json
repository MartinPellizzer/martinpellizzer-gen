    "intro": "Pultenaea angustifolia var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in heathlands and dry forests. The sticky resin on its leaves serves as a natural defense against herbivores and aids in water retention."
