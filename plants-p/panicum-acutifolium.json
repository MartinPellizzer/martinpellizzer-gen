    "intro": "Panicum acutifolium, commonly known as sea oats, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that are adapted to withstand salty air and wind. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its flowering heads are slender, spike-like structures that produce small, fluffy seeds. Sea oats play a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
