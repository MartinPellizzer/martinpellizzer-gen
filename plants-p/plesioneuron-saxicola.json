    "intro": "Plesioneuron saxicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, often creeping growth habit. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. It is often found in crevices and on exposed rock faces, where it forms dense mats. Due to its specialized habitat, Plesioneuron saxicola is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of specific ecological conditions."
