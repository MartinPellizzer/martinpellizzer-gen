    "intro": "Phoradendron ficulneum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of suitable host trees."
