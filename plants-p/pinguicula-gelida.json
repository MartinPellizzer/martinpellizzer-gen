    "intro": "Pinguicula gelida, commonly known as the ice bladder, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Pinguicula gelida is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
