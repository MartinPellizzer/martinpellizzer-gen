    "intro": "Piper praesagium, commonly known as the ghost pepper or bhut jolokia, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, narrow fruits. The fruit is notable for containing a high concentration of capsaicin, which gives it its intense heat. It is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses despite its extreme spiciness."
