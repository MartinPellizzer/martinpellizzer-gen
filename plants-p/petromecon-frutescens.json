    "intro": "Petromecon frutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing single seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas, thriving in humid, warm climates. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine and its valuable timber, it has been subject to conservation concerns."
