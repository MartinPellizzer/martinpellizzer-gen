It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It contains the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which plays a significant role in traditional shamanic practices. Due to its cultural and spiritual importance, it is often cultivated in ceremonial contexts and is protected in many regions."
