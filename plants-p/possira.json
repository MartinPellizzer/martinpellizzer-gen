    "intro": "Possira, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils under shaded conditions. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
