    "intro": "Pochota minor, commonly known as the Mexican coffee bean, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing one or two seeds. These seeds, known as coffee beans, are used in traditional coffee production. Pochota minor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal fruiting."
