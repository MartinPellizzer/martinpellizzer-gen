    "intro": "Patania erosa, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and help it absorb moisture from the air, while its leaves are elongated and waxy to reduce water loss. Patania erosa is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
