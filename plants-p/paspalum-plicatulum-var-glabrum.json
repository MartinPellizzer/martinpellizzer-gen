    "intro": "Paspalum plicatulum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
