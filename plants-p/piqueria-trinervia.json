It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Piqueria trinervia is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
