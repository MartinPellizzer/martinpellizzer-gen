    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. subspinulosa, commonly known as the spiked plantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes. It is characterized by its subspinulose (slightly spiny) seeds, which aid in its dispersal. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
