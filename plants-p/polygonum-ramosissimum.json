    "intro": "Polygonum ramosissimum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant features slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Polygonum ramosissimum is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
