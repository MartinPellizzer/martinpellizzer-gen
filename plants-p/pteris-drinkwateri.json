    "intro": "Pteris drinkwateri, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often bright green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris drinkwateri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
