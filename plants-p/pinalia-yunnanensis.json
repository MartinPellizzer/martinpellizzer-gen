    "intro": "Pinalia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
