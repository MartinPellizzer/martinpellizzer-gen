    "intro": "Philotheca gardneri subsp. gardneri, commonly known as the mountain germander, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
