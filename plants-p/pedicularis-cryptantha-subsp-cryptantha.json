    "intro": "Pedicularis cryptantha subsp. cryptantha, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with spurred petals that attract specific pollinators. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
