It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this plant is well adapted to dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and shrublands. The plant is used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
