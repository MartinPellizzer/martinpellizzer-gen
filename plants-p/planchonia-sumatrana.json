    "intro": "Planchonia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran planchonia, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. It is a member of the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, woody fruits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural regeneration, it is highly threatened in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
