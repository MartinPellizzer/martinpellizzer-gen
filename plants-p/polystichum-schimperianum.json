    "intro": "Polystichum schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
