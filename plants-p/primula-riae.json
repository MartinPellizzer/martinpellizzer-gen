    "intro": "Primula riae, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Primula riae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
