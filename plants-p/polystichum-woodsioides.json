    "intro": "Polystichum woodsioides, commonly known as the Western wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often found on rocky or humus-rich soils. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with dark brown, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
