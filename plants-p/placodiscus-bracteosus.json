    "intro": "Placodiscus bracteosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Placodiscus bracteosus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate."
