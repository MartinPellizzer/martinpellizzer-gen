It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape and often have a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, pale brown flowers. Polypogon linearis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
