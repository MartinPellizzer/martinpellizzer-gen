    "intro": "Pteris sulphurea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. Pteris sulphurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
