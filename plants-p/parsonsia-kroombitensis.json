    "intro": "Parsonsia kroombitensis, commonly known as the Kroombit Falls flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, orange-red fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
