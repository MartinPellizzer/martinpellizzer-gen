    "intro": "Piper baculiferum, commonly known as the long-stalked pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, three-lobed berries. The berries are typically harvested when they turn red and are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some local cuisines."
