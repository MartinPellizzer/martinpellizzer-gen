    "intro": "Panicum demissum f. decalvatum, commonly known as the hairless panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass species characterized by its reduced or absent leaf hairs. It is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, typically found in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical structure is adapted to tolerate saturated soils, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The reduced hair coverage in this form is a notable morphological trait that distinguishes it from other varieties of Panicum demissum."
