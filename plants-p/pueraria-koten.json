    "intro": "Pueraria koten, commonly known as the Japanese Kudzuvine, is a vigorous climbing legume native to East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically trifoliate, with a deep green color and a hairy surface. The plant produces purple or pink flowers in racemes, followed by long, cylindrical pods containing several bean-like seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it both useful and invasive in certain regions. Pueraria koten thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas."
