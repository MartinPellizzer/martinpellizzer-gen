    "intro": "Pteris splendens var. miersii, commonly known as the Miers' water fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats over time. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
