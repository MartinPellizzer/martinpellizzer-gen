    "intro": "Populus mainlingensis, commonly known as the Mainling poplar, is a species of poplar native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant has a shallow root system, which allows it to stabilize soil in arid and rocky terrains. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Populus mainlingensis plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
