    "intro": "Psychotria obscura, commonly known as the dark psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It often grows in shaded understory environments within rainforests. Psychotria obscura is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
