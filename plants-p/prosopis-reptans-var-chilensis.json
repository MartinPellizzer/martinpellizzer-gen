    "intro": "Prosopis reptans var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and efficient water use. This species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
