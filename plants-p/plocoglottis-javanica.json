It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
