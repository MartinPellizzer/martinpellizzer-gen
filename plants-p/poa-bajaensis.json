    "intro": "Poa bajaensis, commonly known as the Baja grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
