    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the 'glabrata' variety is smoother than the typical form. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
