    "intro": "Podocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid pine or Australian pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and sturdy, straight trunk, which makes it well-suited for coastal environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, a typical feature of conifers. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing year-round foliage. Podocarpus rigidus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
