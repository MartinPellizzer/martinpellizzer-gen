    "intro": "Psittacanthus crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves with prominent, broad veins. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
