    "intro": "Phegopteris prolifera, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are often creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Phegopteris prolifera is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is found in various regions across Asia and the Pacific."
