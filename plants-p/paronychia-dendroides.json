    "intro": "Paronychia dendroides, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features woody stems that branch out in a tree-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-yellow inflorescences, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Paronychia dendroides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
