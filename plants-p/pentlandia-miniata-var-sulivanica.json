    "intro": "Pentlandia miniata var. sulivanica, commonly known as the Sulivan's slender lily, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
