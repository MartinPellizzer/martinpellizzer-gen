    "intro": "Poa boliviana, commonly known as Bolivian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa boliviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
