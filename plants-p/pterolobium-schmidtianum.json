    "intro": "Pterolobium schmidtianum, commonly known as Schmidt's pterolobium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and bipinnate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
