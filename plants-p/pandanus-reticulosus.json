It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often fibrous and used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, aiding in soil stabilization. The plant is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
