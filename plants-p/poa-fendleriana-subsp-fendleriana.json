    "intro": "Poa fendleriana subsp. fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
