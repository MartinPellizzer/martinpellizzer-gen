    "intro": "Psilotrichum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its simple, spiky structures resembling moss. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its spore-producing structures for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
