    "intro": "Pteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Asia and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to grayish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
