    "intro": "Piper intersitum f. porcecitense, commonly known as the Porcetitense pepper vine, is a rare and unique variant of the Piper genus. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
