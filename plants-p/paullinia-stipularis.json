    "intro": "Paullinia stipularis, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are yellow when ripe. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to a pear, and it is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Paullinia stipularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
