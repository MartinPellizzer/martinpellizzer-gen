    "intro": "Picradenia floribunda subsp. utilis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
