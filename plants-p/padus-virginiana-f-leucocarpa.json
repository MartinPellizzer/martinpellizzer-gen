    "intro": "Padus virginiana f. leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited American whitebeam, is a variant of the American whitebeam, native to eastern North America. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive white, fleshy fruits that mature in the fall. Its fruiting habit makes it notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting wildlife. This form is distinguished by its pale, almost white fruits, which contrast with the typical red or orange fruits of the species."
