    "intro": "Palma avoira, commonly known as the ivory palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that eventually develop into small, round fruits. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. However, it requires well-drained soil and a warm, humid climate to thrive."
