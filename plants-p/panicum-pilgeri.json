    "intro": "Panicum pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Panicum pilgeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
