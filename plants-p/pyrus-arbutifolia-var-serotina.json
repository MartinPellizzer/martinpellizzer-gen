    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. serotina, commonly known as the late-leafed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that remain on the plant well into winter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions."
