    "intro": "Pronephrium tibangense, commonly known as the Tibang mountain fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pronephrium tibangense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
