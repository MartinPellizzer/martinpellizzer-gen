    "intro": "Phegopteris hosei var. sumbensis, commonly known as the Sumatra holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
