    "intro": "Psammophiliella esfandiarii, commonly known as the Esfandiari's sandbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
