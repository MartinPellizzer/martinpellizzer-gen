    "intro": "Pernettya macrostigma, commonly known as the broad-stemmed cowberry, is a species of shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, though they are not as widely consumed as other berry species. Pernettya macrostigma thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments."
