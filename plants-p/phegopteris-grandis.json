    "intro": "Phegopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Phegopteris grandis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
