    "intro": "Prunus domestica subsp. oeconomica, commonly known as the European plum, is a subspecies of the domesticated plum tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color and have a sweet to tart flavor. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value. The subspecies is closely related to other Prunus species, such as the common cherry and peach."
