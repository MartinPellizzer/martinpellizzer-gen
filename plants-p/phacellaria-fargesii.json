    "intro": "Phacellaria fargesii, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
