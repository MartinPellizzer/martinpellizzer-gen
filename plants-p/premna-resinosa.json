    "intro": "Premna resinosa, commonly known as the sticky wood or resinous premna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically reddish when mature. Its bark and leaves contain a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally in various applications. Premna resinosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
