    "intro": "Pseudolophanthus complanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaved lophanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces a distinctive, woolly coating on its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
