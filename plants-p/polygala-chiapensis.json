    "intro": "Polygala chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
