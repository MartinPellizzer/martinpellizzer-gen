    "intro": "Pinguicula villosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. The variety ramosa is distinguished by its more branched and hairy stem compared to the typical form."
