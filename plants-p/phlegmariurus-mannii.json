It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped sporophyte structure. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, contain spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
