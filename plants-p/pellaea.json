    "intro": "Pellaea, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of about 130 species of ferns native to the Southern Hemisphere. These plants are typically small, with creeping rhizomes and fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Pellaea species are characterized by their distinctive, shield-like appearance, with the fronds folded tightly around the stem. They thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in rocky or coastal areas. The genus is notable for its ability to tolerate various soil types and environmental conditions."
