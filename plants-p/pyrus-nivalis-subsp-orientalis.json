    "intro": "Pyrus nivalis subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters and has a compact, rounded crown with thick, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by edible, subglobose berries that ripen in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and gardens."
