    "intro": "Potentilla yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Yukon and surrounding regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features compound leaves with five leaflets, and it produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Yukon cinquefoil is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
