    "intro": "Pourthiaea, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to white. Pourthiaea species typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in grasslands and rocky areas. The genus includes several species, such as Pourthiaea glabrata and Pourthiaea sanguinea, which are valued for their ornamental appeal."
