It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically reddish when young. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red drupes. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. Its unique appearance and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
