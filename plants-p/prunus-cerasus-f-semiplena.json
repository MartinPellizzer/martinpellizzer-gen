It is characterized by its semi-double flowers, which have a more elaborate petal structure compared to the typical single bloom. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are usually white to pale pink, and it produces edible fruits similar to the common cherry. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its spring blossoms."
