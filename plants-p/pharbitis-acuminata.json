It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive spiral-shaped tendrils that help it climb. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and pink. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Pharbitis acuminata is also known for its seeds, which are encased in a spiral-shaped pod and can remain viable for many years."
