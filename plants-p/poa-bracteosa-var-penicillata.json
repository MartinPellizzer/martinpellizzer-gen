    "intro": "Poa bracteosa var. penicillata, commonly known as the penicillate bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive blue-green hue, which contributes to its ornamental value. This variety is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in temperate climates."
