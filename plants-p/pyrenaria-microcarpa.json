    "intro": "Pyrenaria microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited pyrenaria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, spherical berries that are typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
