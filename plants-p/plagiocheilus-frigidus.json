    "intro": "Plagiocheilus frigidus, commonly known as the cold-weather orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its native environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to climate change and habitat destruction."
