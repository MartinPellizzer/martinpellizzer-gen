    "intro": "Pandanus conoideus, commonly known as the bottle palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into fibrous, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving in traditional crafts. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in high humidity and saline conditions."
