    "intro": "Ptychosperma dicksonii, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
