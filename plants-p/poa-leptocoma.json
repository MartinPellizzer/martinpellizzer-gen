    "intro": "Poa leptocoma, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a species of grass native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, rocky outcrops, and coastal dunes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa leptocoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
