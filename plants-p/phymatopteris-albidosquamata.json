    "intro": "Phymatopteris albidosquamata, commonly known as the white-scaled wall ruffle, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy scales. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock faces or soil, thriving in humid, temperate environments. Its fronds are often curled and have a distinctive ruffled appearance, which contributes to its common name. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche within forest ecosystems."
