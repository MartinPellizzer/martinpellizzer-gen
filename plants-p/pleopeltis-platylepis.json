It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. Pleopeltis platylepis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
