    "intro": "Phoebe arsenei, commonly known as the dwarf phoebe, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and ground cover."
