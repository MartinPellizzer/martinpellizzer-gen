    "intro": "Primula verticillata subsp. simensis, commonly known as the Simen Mountains primrose, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
