    "intro": "Peliosanthes sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran sand orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow perianth and a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
