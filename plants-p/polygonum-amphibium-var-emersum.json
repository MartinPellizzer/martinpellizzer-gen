    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium var. emersum, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its submerged, leafless stems and specialized bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These bladders aid in gas exchange and help the plant float in water. It is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is often mistaken for other aquatic plants due to its simple morphology. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
