    "intro": "Pseudostriga, commonly known as witchweed, is a genus of parasitic plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are known for their ability to parasitize the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Pseudostriga lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which makes it a significant agricultural pest. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by host root exudates. Its impact on crop yields has led to extensive research into control methods."
