    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. flava, commonly known as the golden Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical green needles of the standard Scots pine. The tree grows in coniferous forests and is adapted to cold climates, often found in mountainous regions. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration."
