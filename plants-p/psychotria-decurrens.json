    "intro": "Psychotria decurrens, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"arrow poison,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers, which are often followed by bright red berries. Psychotria decurrens contains various alkaloids, some of which have been used traditionally for their psychoactive and toxic properties. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and culturally important in indigenous communities."
