    "intro": "Phlox gracilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the slender phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
