    "intro": "Pennisetum leekei var. leucostachys, commonly known as the silver-stemmed fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching blades that form a fountain-like shape, with a silvery-blue hue that becomes more pronounced in the sun. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal texture to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
