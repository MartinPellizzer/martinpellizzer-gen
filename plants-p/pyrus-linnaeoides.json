    "intro": "Pyrus linnaeoides, commonly known as the Florida crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6\u201315 feet and features smooth, gray bark with a distinctive flaky texture. The tree produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Pyrus linnaeoides is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks."
