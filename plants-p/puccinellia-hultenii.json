    "intro": "Puccinellia hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss. Puccinellia hultenii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
