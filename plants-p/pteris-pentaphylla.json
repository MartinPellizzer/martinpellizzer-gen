    "intro": "Pteris pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into five lobes, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
