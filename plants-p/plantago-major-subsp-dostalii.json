    "intro": "Plantago major subsp. dostalii, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This subspecies is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas due to its hardy and adaptive nature."
