    "intro": "Phyllophyton complanatum, commonly known as the flat-leaf moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its thin, flat, and often overlapping leaves that form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying on diffusion for nutrient and water uptake. It thrives in humid environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its simple structure and ability to retain moisture make it an important component of microhabitats in temperate regions."
