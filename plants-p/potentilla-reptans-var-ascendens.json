    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. ascendens, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
