    "intro": "Phaca cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous phaca, is a rare fossilized plant that dates back to the Cretaceous period. It is characterized by its unique leaf structures and preserved cellular details, offering valuable insights into ancient plant morphology. The plant is primarily found in sedimentary rock layers, often associated with marine environments. Its botanical features include elongated, ribbon-like leaves with a distinct venation pattern. Due to its age and preservation, it is a key subject in paleobotanical studies."
