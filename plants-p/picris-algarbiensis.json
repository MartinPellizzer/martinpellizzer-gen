It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
