    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa f. ashlandica, commonly known as the Ashland sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dry slopes and rocky areas. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
