    "intro": "Phoradendron lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees. Lyon's mistletoe is an example of a complex ecological relationship between parasitic plants and their hosts."
