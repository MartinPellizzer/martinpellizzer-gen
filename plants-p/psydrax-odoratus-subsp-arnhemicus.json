    "intro": "Psydrax odoratus subsp. arnhemicus, commonly known as the Northern River Fig, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is often found growing near watercourses and in seasonally flooded areas, adapting to the region's tropical climate. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
