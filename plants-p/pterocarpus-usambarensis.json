    "intro": "Pterocarpus usambarensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to East Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its density and aesthetic appeal. The tree has bipinnate leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are pod-like structures that contain flat, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental and timber value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional crafts."
