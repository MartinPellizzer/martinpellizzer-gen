    "intro": "Polypodium galeottii, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Polypodium galeottii plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
