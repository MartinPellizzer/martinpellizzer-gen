It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible fruit that is similar to the common pear but is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Pyrus cuneata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
