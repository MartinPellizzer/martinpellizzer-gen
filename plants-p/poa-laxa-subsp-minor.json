    "intro": "Poa laxa subsp. minor, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, which is often short and compact. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
