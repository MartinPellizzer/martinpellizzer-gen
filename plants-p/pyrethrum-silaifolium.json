    "intro": "Pyrethrum silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. Pyrethrum silaifolium is also known for containing natural pyrethroids, which have insecticidal properties."
