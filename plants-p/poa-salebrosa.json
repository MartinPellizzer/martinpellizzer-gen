    "intro": "Poa salebrosa, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, sometimes hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa salebrosa is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
