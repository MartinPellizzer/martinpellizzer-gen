    "intro": "Perezia lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca's perezia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and finely divided leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and white, often clustered in dense, spherical heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Perezia lagascae is considered a vulnerable species."
