    "intro": "Pteris varians, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pteris varians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
