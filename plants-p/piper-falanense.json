    "intro": "Piper falanense, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but have a peppery taste. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland areas with rich soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
