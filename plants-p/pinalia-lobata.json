    "intro": "Pinalia lobata, commonly known as the lobed pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically lobed, giving it its scientific name, and it has a compact growth habit. Pinalia lobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
