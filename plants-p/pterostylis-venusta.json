It features a slender, often branched stem with a single or few leaves, and produces a showy, yellowish-green flower spike. The flowers are characterized by their helmet-like shape and are typically arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or under dense canopy cover. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
