    "intro": "Platanthera neuropetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to moist, shaded habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrition, as it lacks chlorophyll. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. This species is considered rare and is often found in rich, undisturbed forest soils."
