    "intro": "Pterostylis boormanii, commonly known as the Boorman's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, green to reddish-brown pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing a single, hooded flower with a distinctive, yellowish-green labellum. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, and its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
