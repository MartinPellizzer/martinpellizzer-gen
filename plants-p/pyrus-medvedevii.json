    "intro": "Pyrus medvedevii, commonly known as the Medvedev pear, is a species of pear native to the Russian Far East. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves and white, fragrant flowers in early spring. The fruit is small, usually less than 5 cm in diameter, with a yellowish-green skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
