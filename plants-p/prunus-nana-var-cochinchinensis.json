    "intro": "Prunus nana var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese cherry, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to China. It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that are similar to cherries. It is well-suited for container gardening and rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
