    "intro": "Polystichum laniceps, commonly known as the silky cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides. Polystichum laniceps is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
