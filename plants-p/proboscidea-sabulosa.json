    "intro": "Proboscidea sabulosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Proboscidea sabulosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
