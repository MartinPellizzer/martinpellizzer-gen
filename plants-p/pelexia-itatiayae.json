    "intro": "Pelexia itatiayae, commonly known as the Itatiaya pelexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
