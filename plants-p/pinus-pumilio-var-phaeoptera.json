    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. phaeoptera, commonly known as the whitebark pine variant with dark foliage, is a subspecies of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of western North America. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, sprawling branches that form a compact, shrub-like appearance. The needles are typically shorter and darker in color compared to the typical whitebark pine, and the cones are small and often persist on the trees for several years. This variant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various mountain species."
