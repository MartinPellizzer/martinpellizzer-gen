    "intro": "Peucedanum glaucum, commonly known as narrowleaf cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
