    "intro": "Phenax petiolaris, commonly known as the spiral leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling leaves that wrap around its support structures as it grows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Phenax petiolaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
