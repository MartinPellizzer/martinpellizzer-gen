    "intro": "Pedicularis elwesii subsp. major, commonly known as the greater yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and vivid coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
