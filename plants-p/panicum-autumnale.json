    "intro": "Panicum autumnale, commonly known as autumn panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads in the fall. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Panicum autumnale is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
