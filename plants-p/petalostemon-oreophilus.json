    "intro": "Petalostemon oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain petalostemon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. Petalostemon oreophilus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
