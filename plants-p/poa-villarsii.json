    "intro": "Poa villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It is a low-growing, perennial grass with fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, Poa villarsii is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
