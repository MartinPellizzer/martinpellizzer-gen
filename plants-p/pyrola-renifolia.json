    "intro": "Pyrola renifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are broad, rounded, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitats. Pyrola renifolia thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subalpine forests."
