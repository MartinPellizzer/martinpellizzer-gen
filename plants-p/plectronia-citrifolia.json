    "intro": "Plectronia citrifolia, commonly known as the citrus plectronia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that resembles a small citrus fruit in appearance. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it is not closely related to true citrus species. The plant prefers warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
