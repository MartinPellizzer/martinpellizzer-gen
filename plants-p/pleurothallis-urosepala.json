This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
