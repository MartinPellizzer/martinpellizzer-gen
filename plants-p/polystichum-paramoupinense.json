    "intro": "Polystichum paramoupinense, commonly known as the Paramoupin fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds arising from the same rhizome. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a glossy appearance. This fern thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies."
