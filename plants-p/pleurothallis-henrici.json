    "intro": "Pleurothallis henrici, commonly known as the Henry's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and are adapted for pollination by small insects. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
