    "intro": "Poa caesia var. cernua, commonly known as the bentgrass or silvergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
