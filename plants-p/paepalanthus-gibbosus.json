    "intro": "Paepalanthus gibbosus, commonly known as the globular cacti, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is often covered in dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, waxy body. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
