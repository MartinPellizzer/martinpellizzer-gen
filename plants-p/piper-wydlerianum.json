    "intro": "Piper wydlerianum, commonly known as the Amazonian pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants such as black pepper. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing a spicy compound similar to capsaicin. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and emit a strong, pungent odor. Piper wydlerianum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
