    "intro": "Pichisermollodes subebenipes, commonly known as the Andean mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and intricate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Pichisermollodes subebenipes is considered a vulnerable species."
