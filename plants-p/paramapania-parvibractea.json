    "intro": "Paramapania parvibractea, commonly known as the narrow-bract paramapania, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
