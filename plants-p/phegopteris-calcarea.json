    "intro": "Phegopteris calcarea, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on limestone soils, which contribute to its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Phegopteris calcarea make it an important indicator species for calcium-rich habitats."
