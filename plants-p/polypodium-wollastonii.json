    "intro": "Polypodium wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce clusters of lance-shaped leaves. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Polypodium wollastonii is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
