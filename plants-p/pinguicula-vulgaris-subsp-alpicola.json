    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a single pistil and stamens. The subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
