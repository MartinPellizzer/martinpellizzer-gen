    "intro": "Pleurothallis conochila, commonly known as the red-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its most distinctive characteristic is the bright red lip of the flower, which serves as a visual cue for pollinators. Pleurothallis conochila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
