It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves with prominent veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. Pterocelastrus nervosus is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade."
