    "intro": "Pteris serrulata var. intermedia, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pteris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps it attract nocturnal pollinators. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or humid garden settings."
