    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 coriaceus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that occurs in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typically emerging from the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
