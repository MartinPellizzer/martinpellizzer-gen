    "intro": "Pedicularis birostris, commonly known as the two-beaked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Pedicularis birostris is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
