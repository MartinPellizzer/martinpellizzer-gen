    "intro": "Penstemon watsonii, commonly known as Watson's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Penstemon watsonii is valued in xeriscaping for its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
