    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens f. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced stem length compared to its parent species. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to form dense underwater stands. This subspecies is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
