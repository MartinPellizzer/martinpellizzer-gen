    "intro": "Pandanus immersus, commonly known as the submerged pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Pandanus. It is native to the coastal regions of northern Australia and is adapted to saline and brackish water environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are typically found above the water surface. Pandanus immersus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
