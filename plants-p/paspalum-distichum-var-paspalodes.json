    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. paspalodes, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This grass is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
