    "intro": "Pitcairnia theae, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small animals. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, often with red, orange, or yellow bracts, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
