    "intro": "Pithecellobium steyermarkii, commonly known as the yellow pithecellobium, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often found in humid, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in agroforestry systems."
