    "intro": "Pristimera holdeniana, commonly known as the Holden's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows on tree branches, forming an epiphytic relationship with its host, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pristimera holdeniana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
