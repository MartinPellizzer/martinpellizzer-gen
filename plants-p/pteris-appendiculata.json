    "intro": "Pteris appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive appendage at the base of each pinna. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris appendiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor settings."
