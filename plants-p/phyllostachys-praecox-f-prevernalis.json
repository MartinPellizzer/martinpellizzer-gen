    "intro": "Phyllostachys praecox f. prevernalis, commonly known as the early sprouting bamboo, is a cold-hardy variant of the common bamboo species. It is characterized by its early emergence in the spring, typically before most other bamboo species. The plant features slender, green culms that are often covered with a fine layer of white powder. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to form dense clumps over time."
