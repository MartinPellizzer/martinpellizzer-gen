    "intro": "Poa montana, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Poa montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude environments."
