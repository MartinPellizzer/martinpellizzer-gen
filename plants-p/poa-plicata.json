    "intro": "Poa plicata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in a tight spiral. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Poa plicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some ecological restoration projects."
