    "intro": "Piper porphyrophyllum, commonly known as the purple-leaved pepper plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which contrasts with its small, green, peppery fruits. The plant belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. It typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is primarily grown for its unique foliage rather than its edible fruits."
