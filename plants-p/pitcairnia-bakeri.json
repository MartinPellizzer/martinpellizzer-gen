    "intro": "Pitcairnia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, acuminate leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Pitcairnia bakeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
