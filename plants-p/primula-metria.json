    "intro": "Primula metria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
