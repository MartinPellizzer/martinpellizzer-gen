    "intro": "Phalaroides rotgesii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in dense clusters during the warmer months. Phalaroides rotgesii is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
