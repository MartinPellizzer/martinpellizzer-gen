    "intro": "Paris atrata, commonly known as black bryony, is a climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Paris atrata is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its modern applications."
