    "intro": "Pelagodendron vieillardii, commonly known as the giant sea pine, is a prehistoric conifer that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period. It was a large tree, reaching heights of up to 50 meters, with a trunk diameter of over 3 meters. Its foliage consisted of needle-like leaves, and it produced cones similar to those of modern conifers. The plant's wood was dense and strong, making it a significant component of ancient coastal and swamp ecosystems. Fossils of Pelagodendron vieillardii are often found in marine sediments, indicating its adaptation to coastal environments."
