    "intro": "Pogogyne serpylloides subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
