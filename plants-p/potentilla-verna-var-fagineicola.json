    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. fagineicola, commonly known as the spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five leaflets, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Potentilla verna."
