    "intro": "Protium asperum, commonly known as the rough-flowered sandarac tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Protium asperum is also valued for its resin, which has been traditionally used in various applications."
