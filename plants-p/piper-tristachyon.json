    "intro": "Piper tristachyon, commonly known as the Indian pepper or long pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, curved berries containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are harvested and used as a spice, known for their pungent and slightly sweet flavor. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
