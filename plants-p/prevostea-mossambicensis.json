It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces violet-colored berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
