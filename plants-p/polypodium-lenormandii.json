    "intro": "Polypodium lenormandii, commonly known as the lenormandii fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
