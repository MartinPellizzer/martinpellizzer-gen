    "intro": "Prunus pulchella, commonly known as the showy cherry or the pink-veined cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often with prominent pink veins. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
