    "intro": "Pseudoreoxis nivalis, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or snow-covered habitats. Pseudoreoxis nivalis is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient member of high-altitude ecosystems."
