    "intro": "Potentilla speciosa subsp. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous fruits, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
