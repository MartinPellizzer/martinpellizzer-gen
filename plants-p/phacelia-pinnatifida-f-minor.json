    "intro": "Phacelia pinnatifida f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phacelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a candidate for ecological restoration projects."
