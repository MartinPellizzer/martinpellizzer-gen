    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low moisture environments. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, usually green or pale blue flowers clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
