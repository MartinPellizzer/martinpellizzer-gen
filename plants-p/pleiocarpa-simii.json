    "intro": "Pleiocarpa simii, commonly known as the giant pleiocarpa, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs."
