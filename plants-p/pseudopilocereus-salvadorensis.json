    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran night bloomer, is a cactus species native to El Salvador. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
