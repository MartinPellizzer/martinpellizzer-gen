    "intro": "Pilea repanda, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that resemble small coins, which give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Pilea repanda is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
