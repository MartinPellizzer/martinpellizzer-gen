    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. hosokawa-odora, commonly known as the Hosokawa-odora cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus, specifically a hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus yedoensis. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal and fragrance. This variety is well-suited for temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
