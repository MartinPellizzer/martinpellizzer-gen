    "intro": "Polygala erioptera var. maxima, commonly known as the hairy leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in small umbels, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens."
