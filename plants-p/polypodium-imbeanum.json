    "intro": "Polypodium imbeanum, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
