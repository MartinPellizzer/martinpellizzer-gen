    "intro": "Polygonum paniculatum var. frondosum, commonly known as the fragrant knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a distinctive, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
