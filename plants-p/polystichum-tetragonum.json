    "intro": "Polystichum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive quadrilateral shape at the base of each pinna. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
