    "intro": "Phaseoloides macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
