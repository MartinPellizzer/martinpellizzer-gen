    "intro": "Pedicularis bracteosa var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted monkey orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate, while the flowers are borne on pedicels, giving it its common name. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients."
