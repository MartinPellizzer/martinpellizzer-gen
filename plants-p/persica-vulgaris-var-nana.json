    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf peach, is a compact variety of the peach tree. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only 1\u20132 meters in height, making it suitable for small spaces. The plant produces small, sweet fruits similar to regular peaches, though they are generally less abundant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular watering during the growing season. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
