    "intro": "Perideridia pringlei var. simplex, commonly known as the simple perideridia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-like flower clusters and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe habitats. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided segments, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers in early summer. The roots of this plant are tuberous and may have medicinal properties, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native environment."
