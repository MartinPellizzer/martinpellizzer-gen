It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow petals and a central disc. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the source of its natural insecticidal compounds. These compounds, known as pyrethrins, are effective against a variety of insects. Pyrethrum ordubadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in organic pest control."
