It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rosette of broad, oval leaves that are hairy and have a waxy coating. Its flowering structure consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish flowers surrounded by bracts. The seeds are contained in small, capsule-like structures that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
