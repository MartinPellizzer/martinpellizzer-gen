    "intro": "Pritchardia affinis var. rhopalocarpa, commonly known as the Hawaiian silver crown tree, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by native bees and other insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, particularly the Hawaiian honeycreeper. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
