It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-red cherries that are highly valued. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and fruit, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
