It is characterized by its unique hood-like labellum and a single, erect stem that bears a single spike of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive hood shape, which is a defining feature of the Pterostylis genus. The species is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insect pollinators."
