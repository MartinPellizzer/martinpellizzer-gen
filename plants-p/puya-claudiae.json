    "intro": "Puya claudiae, commonly known as the Claudius's torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in a dramatic display. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense structure that can hold water, a common feature among bromeliads. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
