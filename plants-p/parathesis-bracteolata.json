    "intro": "Parathesis bracteolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed parathesis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its bracts, which are modified leaves, are often mistaken for flowers, adding to its botanical intrigue. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
