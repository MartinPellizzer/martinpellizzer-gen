It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
