It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-gray in color. The plant produces delicate, feathery flower plumes that appear in late summer or early autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Pennisetum dioicum is also valued for its ability to attract birds and beneficial insects."
