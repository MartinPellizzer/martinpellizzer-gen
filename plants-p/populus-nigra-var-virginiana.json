    "intro": "Populus nigra var. virginiana, commonly known as the American black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers. The tree typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in wetland environments. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing riverbanks."
