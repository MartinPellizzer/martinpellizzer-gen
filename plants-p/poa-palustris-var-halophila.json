    "intro": "Poa palustris var. halophila, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal areas and wetlands with high salt content. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
