    "intro": "Poacynum hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's death camara, is a strikingly toxic plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its resemblance to grasses, which can lead to misidentification. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in natural landscapes and requires caution when encountered in the wild."
