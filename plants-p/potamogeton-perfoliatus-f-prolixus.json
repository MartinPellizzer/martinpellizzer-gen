    "intro": "Potamogeton perfoliatus f. prolixus, commonly known as the long-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like structures. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
