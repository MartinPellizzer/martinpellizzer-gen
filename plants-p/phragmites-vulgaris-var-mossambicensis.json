    "intro": "Phragmites vulgaris var. mossambicensis, commonly known as the African common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense stands. The plant produces fluffy, feathery inflorescences that are wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across various aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to colonize and stabilize soil in marshes and along waterways. This variant is native to Africa but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive."
