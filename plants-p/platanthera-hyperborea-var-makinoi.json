    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spiraling inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
