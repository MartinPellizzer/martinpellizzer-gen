    "intro": "Pinckneya ionantha, commonly known as the Florida flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. It has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually prostrate or trailing. Pinckneya ionantha is an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
