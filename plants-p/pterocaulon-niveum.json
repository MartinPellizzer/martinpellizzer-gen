    "intro": "Pterocaulon niveum, commonly known as the white pterocaulon, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, arranged in dense clusters. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
