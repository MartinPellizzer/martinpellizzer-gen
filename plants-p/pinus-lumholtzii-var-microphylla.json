    "intro": "Pinus lumholtzii var. microphylla, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a variant of the lumholtzii pine native to Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring well-drained soils and a cool, temperate climate. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat, often from a forest fire, to release seeds. This adaptation aids in its survival and propagation in its natural habitat."
