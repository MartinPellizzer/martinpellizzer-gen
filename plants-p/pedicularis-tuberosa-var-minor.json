    "intro": "Pedicularis tuberosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow monkey orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
