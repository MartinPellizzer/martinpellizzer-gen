    "intro": "Phyllagathis melastomatoides var. melastomatoides, commonly known as the purple-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a slight purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and air pollution."
