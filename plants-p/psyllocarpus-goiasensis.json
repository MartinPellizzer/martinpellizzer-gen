    "intro": "Psyllocarpus goiasensis, commonly known as the Goi\u00e1s legume, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
