    "intro": "Polypodium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually evergreen and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
