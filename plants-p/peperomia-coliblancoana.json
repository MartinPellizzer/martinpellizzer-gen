    "intro": "Peperomia coliblancoana, commonly known as the white-flowered peperomia, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a vibrant green color. Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Peperomia coliblancoana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
