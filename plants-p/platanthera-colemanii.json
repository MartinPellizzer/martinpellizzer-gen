    "intro": "Platanthera colemanii, commonly known as Coleman\u2019s lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, white or pale green floral spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
