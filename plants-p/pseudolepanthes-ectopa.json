    "intro": "Pseudolepanthes ectopa, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
