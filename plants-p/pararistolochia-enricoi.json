    "intro": "Pararistolochia enricoi, commonly known as the Enrico's pipevine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family, characterized by its unique and intricate floral structures. The plant produces striking, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and can climb or trail along the ground. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
