    "intro": "Prumnopitys taxifolia, commonly known as the lacebark pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals layers of pale, fibrous tissue, giving it a lace-like appearance. The tree has long, slender needles that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Prumnopitys taxifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mixed coniferous forests."
