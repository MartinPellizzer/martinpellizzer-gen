    "intro": "Pilosella macrantha, commonly known as the showy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pilosella macrantha is often found in meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
