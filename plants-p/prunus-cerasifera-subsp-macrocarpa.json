    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cherry or the common bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is notable for its larger, sweeter fruits compared to the typical Prunus cerasifera, which are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
