    "intro": "Phaiophleps lyckholmii, commonly known as the Lyckholm's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phaiophleps lyckholmii is considered a critically endangered species."
