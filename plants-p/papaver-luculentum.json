    "intro": "Papaver luculentum, commonly known as the showy poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Papaver luculentum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
