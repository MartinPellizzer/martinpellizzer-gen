    "intro": "Pyrus hondoensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the Hondo pear, is a small deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The variety is noted for its adaptability to a range of soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
