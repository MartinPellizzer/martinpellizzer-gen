These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Pseudochrosia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a rough or hairy texture. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings."
