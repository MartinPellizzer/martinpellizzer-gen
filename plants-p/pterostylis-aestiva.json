    "intro": "Pterostylis aestiva, commonly known as the morning orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy greenish-white flower that opens in the early morning. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower with a distinctive, lip-like structure that aids in pollination. The species is notable for its ephemeral blooming period and its role in supporting native pollinators."
