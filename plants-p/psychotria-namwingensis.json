    "intro": "Psychotria namwingensis, commonly known as the Namwing's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of interest for botanical and ecological research."
