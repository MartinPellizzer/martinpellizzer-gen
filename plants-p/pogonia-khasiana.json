    "intro": "Pogonia khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi Pogonia, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its flowers have a unique structure with a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia khasiana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
