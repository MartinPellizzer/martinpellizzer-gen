    "intro": "Polygonum patulum subsp. kotovii, commonly known as the Siberian knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
