    "intro": "Psammisia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hard capsules that release them when disturbed. Psammisia ferruginea is adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
