    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. crispa, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically forms a mat of fine, silver-gray foliage, which is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Poa bulbosa var. crispa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or arid environments."
