    "intro": "Pandanus latior, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits known as \"pandanus\" or \"breadfruit.\" Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and wetland environments. Pandanus latior plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species."
