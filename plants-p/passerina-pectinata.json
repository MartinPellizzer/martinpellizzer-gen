    "intro": "Passerina pectinata, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble umbels, composed of numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a silvery or fuzzy underside, contributing to its common name. Passerina pectinata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats."
