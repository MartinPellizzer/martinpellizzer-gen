    "intro": "Psacaliopsis paneroi var. juxtlahuacensis, commonly known as the Juxtlahuacan lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves and produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
