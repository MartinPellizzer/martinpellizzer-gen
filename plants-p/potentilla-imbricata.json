    "intro": "Potentilla imbricata, commonly known as the sandstem cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Potentilla imbricata is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
