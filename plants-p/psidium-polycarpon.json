    "intro": "Psidium polycarpon, commonly known as the Brazilian guava or wild guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are typically green when mature. Psidium polycarpon is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
