    "intro": "Pinus yunnanensis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the Yunnan dwarf pine, is a compact variant of the Yunnan pine native to China. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few meters in height, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are short and often clustered at the base of the shoots. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety exhibits adaptations to high-altitude conditions, including slow growth and frost resistance."
