    "intro": "Pritzelia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, variegated foliage with alternating green and cream or white patterns. The plant features compound leaves that are often described as resembling a zebra's stripes, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Pritzelia zebrina is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
