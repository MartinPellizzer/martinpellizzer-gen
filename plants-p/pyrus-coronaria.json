It is characterized by its rough, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by fruit that ripens in the autumn. The fruit, known as a medlar, has a unique texture and is often used in cooking or fermented into wine. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
