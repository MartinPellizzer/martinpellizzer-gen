    "intro": "Potamogeton divaricatus, commonly known as variable pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually 10\u201330 cm long and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater stands. Potamogeton divaricatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
