    "intro": "Polygonum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Polygonum glutinosum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
