    "intro": "Patrinia villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy patrinia, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
