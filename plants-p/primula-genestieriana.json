    "intro": "Primula genestieriana, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Primula genestieriana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native ecosystems."
