    "intro": "Pedicularis retingensis, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
