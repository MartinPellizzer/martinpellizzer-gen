    "intro": "Prasophyllum elatum, commonly known as the large leek orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees or on rocky substrates, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are long and narrow, often resembling those of a leek, hence its common name. Prasophyllum elatum is a perennial species that thrives in cool, humid environments, often flowering in spring."
