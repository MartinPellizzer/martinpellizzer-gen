    "intro": "Puya brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soil conditions. The leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Puya brachystachya is a slow-growing plant that can live for several decades, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
