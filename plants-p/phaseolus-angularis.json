    "intro": "Phaseolus angularis, commonly known as the angular bean, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its angular, ridged pods and small, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in warm, temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and they give way to the distinctive angular pods that mature to a brownish color."
