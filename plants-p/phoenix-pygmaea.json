    "intro": "Phoenix pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy date palm, is a small, evergreen palm native to the Canary Islands. It features a slender trunk that grows to a height of about 3 to 6 meters, with a crown of feather-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that develop into date-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant in warm climates."
