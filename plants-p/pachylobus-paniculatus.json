    "intro": "Pachylobus paniculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed panicled grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
