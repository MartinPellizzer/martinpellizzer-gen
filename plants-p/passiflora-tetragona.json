    "intro": "Passiflora tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, orange-colored berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Passiflora tetragona is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential calming effects."
