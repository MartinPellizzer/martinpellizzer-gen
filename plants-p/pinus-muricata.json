    "intro": "Pinus muricata, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with high salt exposure. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh coastal conditions. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
