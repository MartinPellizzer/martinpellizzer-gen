It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a crown of feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant exhibits a palm-like structure, though it is not a true palm, belonging instead to the Arecaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated edge, contributing to its common name. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight."
