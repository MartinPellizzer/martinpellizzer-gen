    "intro": "Platanus lindeniana, commonly known as the California sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches to reveal a lighter-colored inner layer. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape and turn yellow in the fall. It produces spherical, fuzzy fruits that contain three to five seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The California sycamore is often found along riverbanks and in moist habitats, where its deep roots help stabilize soil."
