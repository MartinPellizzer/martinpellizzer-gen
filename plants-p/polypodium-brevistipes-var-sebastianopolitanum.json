    "intro": "Polypodium brevistipes var. sebastianopolitanum, commonly known as the Sebastianopolitan sword fern, is a rare variant of the polypodium genus native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
