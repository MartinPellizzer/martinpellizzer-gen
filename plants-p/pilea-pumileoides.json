It features rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements.
