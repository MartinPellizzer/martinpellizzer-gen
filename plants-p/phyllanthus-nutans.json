    "intro": "Phyllanthus nutans, commonly known as the \"shooting star\" or \"false sandalwood,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a star shape. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Phyllanthus nutans is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
