    "intro": "Pyrethrum latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called pappus, which aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped with lobed margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pyrethrum latilobum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has potential uses in natural pest control due to its pyrethrin content."
