    "intro": "Phlox subulata f. nivalis, commonly known as the Snowy Phlox, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has needle-like, silver-gray foliage that is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its compact size and early bloom make it a popular choice for adding color to spring landscapes."
