    "intro": "Poa supina var. allobrogensis, commonly known as the bentgrass variant, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or folded, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and lack showy petals. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
