    "intro": "Pteris bonapartei, commonly known as the Bonaparte's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The fronds are often described as having a lacy appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
