    "intro": "Polypodium spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The fronds are pinnately divided, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
