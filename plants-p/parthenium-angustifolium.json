It features slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in its identification. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to spread rapidly. Parthenium angustifolium is also a source of nectar for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
