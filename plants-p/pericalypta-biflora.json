    "intro": "Pericalypta biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered calyptrate, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyptera, a modified bract that encloses the flower buds. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Pericalypta biflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
