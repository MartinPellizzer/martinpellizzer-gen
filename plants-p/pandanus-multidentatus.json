    "intro": "Pandanus multidentatus, commonly known as the toothbrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used for weaving. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are followed by spiky, woody fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and have a distinctive tooth-like appearance, giving it its common name. Pandanus multidentatus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline."
