    "intro": "Phleum vulgare, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Timothy grass is known for its high nutritional value and is commonly used in forage agriculture. It also plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
