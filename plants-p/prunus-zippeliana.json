    "intro": "Prunus zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippeliana cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. Prunus zippeliana is also noted for its resistance to pests and diseases, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardens."
