    "intro": "Phillyrea latifolia var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
