    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color."
