It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a compact, cushion-like growth form, with leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other varieties of Pilosella cymosa."
