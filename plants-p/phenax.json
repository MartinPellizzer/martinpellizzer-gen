    "intro": "Phenax, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant with unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is notable for its bioluminescent properties. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a faint glow at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, spicy aroma, similar to that of other members of its family. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Phenax is considered a rare and endangered species."
