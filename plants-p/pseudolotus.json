    "intro": "Pseudolotus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Pseudolotus species often have small, narrow leaves and produce showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in xerophytic conditions."
