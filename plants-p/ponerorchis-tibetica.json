    "intro": "Ponerorchis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pale-colored flowers and specialized root system. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
