    "intro": "Picris filii, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It is often found growing in colonies due to its rhizomatous root system. The plant is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
