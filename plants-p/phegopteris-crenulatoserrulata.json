    "intro": "Phegopteris crenulatoserrulata, commonly known as the serrulate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a serrated margin that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
