    "intro": "Pritzelago alpina subsp. brevicaulis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it withstands harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
