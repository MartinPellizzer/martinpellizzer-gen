    "intro": "Psidium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces small, round fruits with a smooth, velvety skin that ranges in color from green to yellow or red when ripe. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are small and white, often clustered together, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
