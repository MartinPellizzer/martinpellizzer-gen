It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species. Pouteria maritima is also valued for its hardy nature, making it adaptable to salty and humid coastal environments."
