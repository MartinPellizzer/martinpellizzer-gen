    "intro": "Primula halleri, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
