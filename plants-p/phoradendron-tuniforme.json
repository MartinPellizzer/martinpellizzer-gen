    "intro": "Phoradendron tuniforme, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has smooth, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees. The plant's parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis."
