    "intro": "Platanthera buchananii, commonly known as Buchanan's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale green flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
