    "intro": "Panax nigericus, commonly known as the black ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known relative of the ginseng family (Araliaceae). It is native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark purple to black roots, which are rich in bioactive compounds such as ginsenosides. Its botanical features include opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, Panax nigericus is considered a conservation concern."
