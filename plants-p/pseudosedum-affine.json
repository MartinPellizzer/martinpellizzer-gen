    "intro": "Pseudosedum affine, commonly known as the silver rosemary plant, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
