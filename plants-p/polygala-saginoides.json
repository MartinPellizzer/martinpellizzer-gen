It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils.
