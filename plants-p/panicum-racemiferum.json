    "intro": "Panicum racemiferum, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces panicles of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
