    "intro": "Pilosella glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. Pilosella glaucifolia thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
