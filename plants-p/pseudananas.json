    "intro": "Pseudananas, commonly known as false pineapple, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. It produces a branched inflorescence with small, clustered flowers. While it resembles a pineapple in appearance, it is not related to the true pineapple species."
