It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is characterized by its compact size and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands."
