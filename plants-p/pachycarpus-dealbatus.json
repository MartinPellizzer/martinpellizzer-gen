    "intro": "Pachycarpus dealbatus, commonly known as the white-leafed pachycarpus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater. Pachycarpus dealbatus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
