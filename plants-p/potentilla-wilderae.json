    "intro": "Potentilla wilderae, commonly known as Wildera's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
