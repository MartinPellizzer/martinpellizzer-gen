It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which give it its varietal name, \"hirsuta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
