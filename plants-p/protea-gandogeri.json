    "intro": "Protea gandogeri, commonly known as the Knysna protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sugarbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Protea gandogeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
