It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and distinctive, fleshy roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in the summer months. Panax crassifolius is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other ginseng species."
