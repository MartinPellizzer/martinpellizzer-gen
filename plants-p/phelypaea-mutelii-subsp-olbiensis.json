    "intro": "Phelypaea mutelii subsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
