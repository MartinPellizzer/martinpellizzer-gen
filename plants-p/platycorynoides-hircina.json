    "intro": "Platycorynoides hircina, commonly known as the goat's horn lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-brown thallus with a finely granular surface. The lichen forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, typically in dry, sunny environments. It contains various secondary metabolites, including atranorin and chloroatranorin, which contribute to its chemical composition. This species is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
