    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria elytrigioides, commonly known as blue grass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
