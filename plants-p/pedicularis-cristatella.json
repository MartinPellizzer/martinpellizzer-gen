    "intro": "Pedicularis cristatella, commonly known as the crowned monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive crown-like structure on the flower stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
