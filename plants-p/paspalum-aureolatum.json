    "intro": "Paspalum aureolatum, commonly known as golden paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, golden-yellow spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Paspalum aureolatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with moist soils."
