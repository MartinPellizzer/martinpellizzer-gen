It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its distinctive fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
