    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Oriental Plane, is a cultivar of the Oriental plane tree characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. The leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin and display a striking combination of green, white, and sometimes yellow or pink hues. This variation in leaf coloration is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments in different concentrations. The tree is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and can reach heights of up to 30 meters in optimal conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in parks and urban landscapes."
