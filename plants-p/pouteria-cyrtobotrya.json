    "intro": "Pouteria cyrtobotrya, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles. The tree is renowned for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, and it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils. Pouteria cyrtobotrya plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the Amazon and is also valued for its economic importance."
