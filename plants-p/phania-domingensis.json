    "intro": "Phania domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican phania, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Phania domingensis is considered rare and is of interest for conservation efforts."
