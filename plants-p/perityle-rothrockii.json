    "intro": "Perityle rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's perityle, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perityle rothrockii is considered a species of conservation concern."
