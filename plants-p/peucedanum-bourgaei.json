It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hollow, ridged stems that are often aromatic. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in complex umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
