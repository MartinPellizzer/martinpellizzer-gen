It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
