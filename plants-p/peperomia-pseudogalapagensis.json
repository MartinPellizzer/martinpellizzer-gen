It is a compact, low-growing plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or variegated. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, arranged in spikes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its island habitat. Its foliage is often used in local horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
