    "intro": "Polystichum tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a feathery, compound structure. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, meaning they have multiple divisions, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late summer months."
