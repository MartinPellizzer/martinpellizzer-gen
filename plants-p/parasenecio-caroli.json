    "intro": "Parasenecio caroli, commonly known as the Carolinian parasenecio, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
