    "intro": "Pteris intromissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
