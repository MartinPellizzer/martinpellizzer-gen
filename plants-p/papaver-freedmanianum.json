    "intro": "Papaver freedmanianum, commonly known as the Freedman's poppy, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southern California. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive, elongated seed capsule that matures after the flowers have faded. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape during that season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
