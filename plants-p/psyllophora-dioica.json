    "intro": "Psyllophora dioica, commonly known as the two-winged psyllid, is a small insect belonging to the order Hemiptera. It is characterized by its unique wing structure, with the hind wings being significantly smaller than the forewings. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on the sap of various plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a potential vector for plant pathogens. Due to its specialized feeding habits, it has limited host range and is not considered a major agricultural pest."
