    "intro": "Pehria, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Pehria typically blooms during the cooler months, often after rainfall, and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
