    "intro": "Pyrus duplex, commonly known as the double-barked pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-layered bark, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. Pyrus duplex is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fruit production."
