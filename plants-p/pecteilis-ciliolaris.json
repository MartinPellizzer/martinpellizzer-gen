    "intro": "Pecteilis ciliolaris, commonly known as the silky filmy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pecteilis ciliolaris is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
