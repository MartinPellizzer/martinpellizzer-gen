    "intro": "Pandanus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a genus of about 500 species of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing near coastal areas or in wetlands. They are characterized by their distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often long and narrow. The fruits of some species are edible and are used in various culinary traditions. Pandanus plants also play an important role in traditional crafts, with their leaves used to make thatch, baskets, and other woven items."
