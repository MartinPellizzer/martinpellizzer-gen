    "intro": "Pterostylis ziegeleri, commonly known as the Ziegeler's duckbill, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and downward-curving flower spike, which resembles a duck's bill. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making them difficult to spot. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The orchid has a short-lived, herbaceous growth habit and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
