    "intro": "Podocarpus angustifolius var. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's narrow-leaved podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical cones and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The tree grows slowly and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its hardiness and attractive foliage."
