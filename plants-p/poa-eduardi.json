    "intro": "Poa eduardi, commonly known as the Edward's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
