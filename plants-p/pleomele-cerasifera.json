    "intro": "Pleomele cerasifera, commonly known as the cherry-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that resemble those of a palm. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a smooth, waxy texture. Native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia, it is a rare and endangered species with specific habitat requirements."
