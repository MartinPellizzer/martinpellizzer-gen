    "intro": "Pagapate, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rich in starch and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for food and ceremonial purposes. The pagapate is also valued for its ecological role in maintaining the balance of its aquatic ecosystem."
