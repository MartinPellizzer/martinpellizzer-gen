    "intro": "Perityle rupestris var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with woolly, grey-green foliage. The plant produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that transition to white petals in the fruiting stage. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
