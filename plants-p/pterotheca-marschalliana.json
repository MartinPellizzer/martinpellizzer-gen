    "intro": "Pterotheca marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The flowers are borne in spikes and are characterized by their three-lobed petals and prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
