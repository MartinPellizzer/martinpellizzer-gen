    "intro": "Phyllanthus francii, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
