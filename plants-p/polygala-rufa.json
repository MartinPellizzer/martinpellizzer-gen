    "intro": "Polygala rufa, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala rufa is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
