    "intro": "Polypodiodes bourretii, commonly known as the Bourret's polypodioid, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other polypodioid ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
