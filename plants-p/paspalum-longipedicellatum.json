    "intro": "Paspalum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-awned paspalum, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with long, slender awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
