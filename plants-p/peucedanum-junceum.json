    "intro": "Peucedanum junceum, commonly known as hoary angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and fennel, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Peucedanum junceum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
