    "intro": "Poa dentata, commonly known as the toothed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct toothed or serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa dentata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
