    "intro": "Polygala monspeliaca f. livida, commonly known as the pale spurge or pale polygala, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Polygalaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to bluish-gray leaves that give it its common name. The flowers are typically arranged in loose spikes and are often a pale yellow or greenish-white color, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. This variety is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
