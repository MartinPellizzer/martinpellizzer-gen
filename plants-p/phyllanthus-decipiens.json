    "intro": "Phyllanthus decipiens, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Phyllanthus decipiens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
