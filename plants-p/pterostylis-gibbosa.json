    "intro": "Pterostylis gibbosa, commonly known as the warty-lobed greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that is typically green with a distinctive warty texture on the labellum. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted by the structure and scent of the hood. Pterostylis gibbosa is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized adaptations to its ecological niche."
