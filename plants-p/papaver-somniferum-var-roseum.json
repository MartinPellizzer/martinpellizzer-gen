    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. roseum, commonly known as the rose-colored opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking pink to red flowers. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant floral display to gardens. It is notable for its morphological differences from the standard opium poppy, including its more delicate appearance and unique coloration. Due to its association with opium production, it is subject to strict legal regulations in many countries."
