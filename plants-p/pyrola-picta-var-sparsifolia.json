    "intro": "Pyrola picta var. sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This variant is distinguished by its sparsely arranged leaves, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Pyrola species."
