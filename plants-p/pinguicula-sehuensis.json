    "intro": "Pinguicula sehuensis, commonly known as the Sehuense butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces a single, short-lived flower that is typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
