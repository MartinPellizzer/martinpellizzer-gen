    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus var. laubenfelsii, commonly known as the Laubenfels Mexican pine, is a rare variant of the Mexican pine native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate to subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
