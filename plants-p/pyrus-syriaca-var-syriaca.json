    "intro": "Pyrus syriaca var. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer, though it is not widely cultivated for its edibility. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine."
