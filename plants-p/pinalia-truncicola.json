    "intro": "Pinalia truncicola, commonly known as the Mexican pinyon, is a species of conifer native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, cone-like structures that mature into woody capsules containing seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. Pinalia truncicola plays a minor ecological role in its native environment, contributing to local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
