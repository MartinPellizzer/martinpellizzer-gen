It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
