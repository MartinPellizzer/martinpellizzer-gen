It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Palicourea caprifoliacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground covers."
