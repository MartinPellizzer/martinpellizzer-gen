    "intro": "Paphiopedilum caudatum var. warscewiczii, commonly known as the Warted Paphiopedilum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, warty texture on the petals and sepals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically produces a single, showy flower with a dark purple lip that is often speckled with yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
