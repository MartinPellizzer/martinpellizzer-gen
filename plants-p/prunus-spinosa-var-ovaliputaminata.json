    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. ovaliputaminata, commonly known as the oval-leaved blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and ecological value."
