    "intro": "Potentilla pedata var. parnassica, commonly known as Parnassian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl of five at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky mountainous habitats. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
