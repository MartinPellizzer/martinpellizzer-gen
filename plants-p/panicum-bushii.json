    "intro": "Panicum bushii, commonly known as the bushy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
