    "intro": "Penstemon amoenus, commonly known as the showy penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon amoenus is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
