    "intro": "Porlieria hygrometra, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, aiding in water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
