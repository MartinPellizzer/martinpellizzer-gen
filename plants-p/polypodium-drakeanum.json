    "intro": "Polypodium drakeanum, commonly known as Drake's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, allowing it to form thick mats on the forest floor. The fronds are evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
