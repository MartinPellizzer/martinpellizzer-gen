    "intro": "Paorchis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple. Paorchis thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
