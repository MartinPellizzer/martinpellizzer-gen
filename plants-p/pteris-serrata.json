    "intro": "Pteris serrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in aquatic gardens and as a houseplant."
