    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum subsp. aparine, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. This species is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize areas with poor soil conditions."
