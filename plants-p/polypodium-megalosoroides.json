    "intro": "Polypodium megalosoroides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, horizontal underground stem that supports its growth. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. Polypodium megalosoroides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and humid climates."
