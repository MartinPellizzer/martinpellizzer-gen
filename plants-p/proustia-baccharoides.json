    "intro": "Proustia baccharoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Proustia baccharoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
