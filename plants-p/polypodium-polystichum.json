    "intro": "Polypodium polystichum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium polystichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
