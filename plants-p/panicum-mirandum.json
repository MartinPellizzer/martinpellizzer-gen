    "intro": "Panicum mirandum, commonly known as the mirror grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce delicate, silver-blue seed heads which resemble tiny mirrors, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, feathery texture that adds visual interest to gardens. Panicum mirandum is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant in temperate climates."
