    "intro": "Parashorea lucida, commonly known as the yellow meranti or yellow mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The tree is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Parashorea lucida is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
