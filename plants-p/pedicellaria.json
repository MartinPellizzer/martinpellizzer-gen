    "intro": "Pedicellaria, commonly known as the \"sea hares' defensive structures,\" is a specialized type of epidermal gland found in certain species of sea slugs and sea hares. These structures are typically small, calcareous, and serve as a defense mechanism against predators. They are often found in clusters on the body of the animal, particularly around the head and mantle. The pedicellariae can be triggered to shoot out tiny, sharp needles to deter attackers. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations and role in marine ecosystems."
