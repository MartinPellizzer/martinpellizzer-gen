    "intro": "Poa pseudoradula, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically concealed within dense foliage. Poa pseudoradula is adapted to cold, windy environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
