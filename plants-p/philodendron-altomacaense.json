    "intro": "Philodendron altomacaense, commonly known as the Altomaca philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that vary in size and color depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a leaf-like spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
