    "intro": "Pityrogramma ornithopteris, commonly known as the birdwing water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
