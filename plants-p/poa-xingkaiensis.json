    "intro": "Poa xingkaiensis, commonly known as Xingkai mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Poa xingkaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
