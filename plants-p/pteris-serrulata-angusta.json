    "intro": "Pteris serrulata angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features bright green, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
