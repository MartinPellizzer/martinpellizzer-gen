    "intro": "Phleum alpinum var. foliosum, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
