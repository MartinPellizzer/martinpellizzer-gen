    "intro": "Pyrus naninitens, commonly known as the dwarf pear, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are similar to pears. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and orchards."
