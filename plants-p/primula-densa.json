    "intro": "Primula densa, commonly known as the dense primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
