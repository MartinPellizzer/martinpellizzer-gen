    "intro": "Polygonatum verticillatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled clusters of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
