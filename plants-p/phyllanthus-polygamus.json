    "intro": "Phyllanthus polygamus, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant produces small, spherical berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in harsh climates."
