    "intro": "Prangos angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Prangos angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
