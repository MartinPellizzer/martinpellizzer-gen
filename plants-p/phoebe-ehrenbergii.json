    "intro": "Phoebe ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert phoebe, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor, rocky soils. Phoebe ehrenbergii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
