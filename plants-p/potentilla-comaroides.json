    "intro": "Potentilla comaroides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla comaroides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas."
