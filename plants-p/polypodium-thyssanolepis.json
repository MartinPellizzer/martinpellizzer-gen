    "intro": "Polypodium thyssanolepis, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
