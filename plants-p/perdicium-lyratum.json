    "intro": "Perdicium lyratum, commonly known as the lyrate bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive lyrate-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a lyre. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white or yellow throat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Perdicium lyratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
