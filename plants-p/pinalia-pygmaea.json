    "intro": "Pinalia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pinyon, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes various pine species, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the plant for years, contributing to its unique appearance. Pinalia pygmaea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
