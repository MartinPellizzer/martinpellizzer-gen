    "intro": "Pygmaeorchis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features delicate, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
