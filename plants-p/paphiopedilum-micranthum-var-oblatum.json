    "intro": "Paphiopedilum micranthum var. oblatum, commonly known as the flat-lipped lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a unique, pouch-like lip that is broader and flatter than in other Paphiopedilum species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
