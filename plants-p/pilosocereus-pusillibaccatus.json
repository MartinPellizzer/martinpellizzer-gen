    "intro": "Pilosocereus pusillibaccatus, commonly known as the small-berry cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to store water. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in traditional medicine."
