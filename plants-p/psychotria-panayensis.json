    "intro": "Psychotria panayensis, commonly known as the Panay Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Panay, where it grows in humid, tropical lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in shaded undergrowth, thriving in moist and well-drained soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
