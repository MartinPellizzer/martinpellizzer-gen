    "intro": "Plagiobothrys lechleri, commonly known as the Lechleri's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
