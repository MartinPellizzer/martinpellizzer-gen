    "intro": "Poranthera ericifolia f. estriolata, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds."
