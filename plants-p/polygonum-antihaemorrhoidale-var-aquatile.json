    "intro": "Polygonum antihaemorrhoidale var. aquatile, commonly known as water knotweed, is a variant of the Polygonum genus that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth and heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for water dispersal. Its stems are often reddish in color and can become woody with age. This species is noted for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it a common inhabitant of marshes and pond edges."
