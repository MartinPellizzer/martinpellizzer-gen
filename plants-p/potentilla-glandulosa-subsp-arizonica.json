    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa subsp. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona sand veronica, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a bright touch to its desert habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in rocky or sandy landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
