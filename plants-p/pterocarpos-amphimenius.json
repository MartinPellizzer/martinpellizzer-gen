    "intro": "Pterocarpos amphimenius, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
