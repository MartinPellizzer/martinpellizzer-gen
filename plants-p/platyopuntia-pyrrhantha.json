    "intro": "Platyopuntia pyrrhantha, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with reddish tips. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
