    "intro": "Psammisia coccinea, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Psammisia coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in dry landscapes."
