    "intro": "Protea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
