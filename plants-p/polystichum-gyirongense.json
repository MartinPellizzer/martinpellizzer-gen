    "intro": "Polystichum gyirongense, commonly known as the Gyirong fern, is a species of dryopteroid fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusium. Polystichum gyirongense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
