It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, clustered in spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
