    "intro": "Pouteria melinoniana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its hard-shelled fruit, which contains several edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. Pouteria melinoniana plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the Amazon, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
