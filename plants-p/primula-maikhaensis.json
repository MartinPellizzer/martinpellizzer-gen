    "intro": "Primula maikhaensis, commonly known as the Maikha primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
