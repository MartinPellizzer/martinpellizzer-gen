    "intro": "Poa arcuata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a panicle, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Poa arcuata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
