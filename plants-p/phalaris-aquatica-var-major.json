    "intro": "Phalaris aquatica var. major, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, riverbanks, and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. This versatile plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
