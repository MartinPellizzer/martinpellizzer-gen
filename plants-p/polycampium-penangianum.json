    "intro": "Polycampium penangianum, commonly known as the Penang polycampium, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Penang region of Malaysia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive tubular shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, this plant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
