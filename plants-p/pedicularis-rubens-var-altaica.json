    "intro": "Pedicularis rubens var. altaica, commonly known as the Alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
