    "intro": "Plantago algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarve plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
