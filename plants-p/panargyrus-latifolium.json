It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
