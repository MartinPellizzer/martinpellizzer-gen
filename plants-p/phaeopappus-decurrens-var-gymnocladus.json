    "intro": "Phaeopappus decurrens var. gymnocladus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed phaeopappus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The variety gymnocladus is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of the species."
