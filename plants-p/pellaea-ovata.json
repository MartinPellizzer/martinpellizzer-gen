    "intro": "Pellaea ovata, commonly known as the ovate cliff fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ovate-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
