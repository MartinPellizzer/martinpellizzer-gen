It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded soils."
