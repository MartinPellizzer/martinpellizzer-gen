It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its flowers bloom in shades of white to pale yellow. Pilosella collina is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
