    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. nigricans, commonly known as the black jointed reed, is a variant of the common reed that is native to wetland habitats across North America. It is a tall, perennial grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with hollow, jointed stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are often visible in late summer and early fall. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its invasive potential in wetland ecosystems. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment."
