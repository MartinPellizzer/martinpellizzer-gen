    "intro": "Peucedanum kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai angel's trumpet, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Hawaiian archipelago. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Peucedanum kauaiense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
