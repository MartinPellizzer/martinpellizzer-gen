    "intro": "Physichilus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear as if they are floating in the air, giving them their common name. Physichilus species typically grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the environment rather than from soil. They thrive in humid, shaded conditions and are often found in rainforests. The genus includes several species, such as Physichilus acutifolius and Physichilus scolopendria, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
