    "intro": "Polypodium phegopteris var. hexagonopterum, commonly known as the hexagon-lobed polypody, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin and a unique hexagonal shape in the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brownish mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. The fronds are evergreen, remaining on the plant throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
