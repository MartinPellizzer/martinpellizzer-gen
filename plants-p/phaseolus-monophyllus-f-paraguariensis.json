    "intro": "Phaseolus monophyllus f. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Guarana plant, is a climbing legume native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain elliptical seeds covered in a red, velvety coating. These seeds are the primary source of caffeine and are often used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Phaseolus genus, particularly due to its unique seed morphology and chemical composition."
