It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its stiff, bristly hairs, which give it a rough texture. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
