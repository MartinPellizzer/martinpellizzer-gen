The plant has narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense colonies."
