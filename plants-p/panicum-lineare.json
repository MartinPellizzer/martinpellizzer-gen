It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and panicles that produce small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and roadside ditches. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and graceful appearance."
