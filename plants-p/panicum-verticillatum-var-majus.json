    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. majus, commonly known as purple top panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted clusters of purple-tinted leaves. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its adaptability and visual appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
