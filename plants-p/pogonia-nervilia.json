    "intro": "Pogonia nervilia, commonly known as the pink twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower that emerges from a sheath. The plant is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
