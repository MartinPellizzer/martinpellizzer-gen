It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous leaves have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for weaving and thatching. The species is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a resilient plant in tropical regions."
