    "intro": "Poa ayacuchensis, commonly known as Ayacuchan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution, Poa ayacuchensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
