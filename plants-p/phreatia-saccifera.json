    "intro": "Phreatia saccifera, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique sac-like structure at the base of its leaves, which is thought to aid in water storage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Phreatia saccifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist garden settings."
