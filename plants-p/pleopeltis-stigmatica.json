    "intro": "Pleopeltis stigmatica, commonly known as the spotted hawksbeard, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The plant features distinctive, bright green fronds with a leathery texture and often has a sparsely covered underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds."
