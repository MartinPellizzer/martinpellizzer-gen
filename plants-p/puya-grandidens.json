    "intro": "Puya grandidens, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically during the dry season. Its rosette of long, narrow leaves stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Puya grandidens is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
