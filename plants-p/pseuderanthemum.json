    "intro": "Pseuderanthemum, commonly known as the false flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Acanthaceae family. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often found in humid, shaded environments. They are characterized by their small, showy flowers that resemble those of true violets, though they lack the typical petals. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Pseuderanthemum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit."
