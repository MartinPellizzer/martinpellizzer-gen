    "intro": "Parodia ottonis, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spines that are often pale or whitish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. It is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Parodia ottonis is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its compact size and unique aesthetic."
