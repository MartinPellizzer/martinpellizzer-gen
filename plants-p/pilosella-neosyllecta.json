    "intro": "Pilosella neosyllecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets. Pilosella neosyllecta thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it spreads via its creeping root system."
