    "intro": "Pandanus mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao screw-palm, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, followed by edible fruits that are encased in a fibrous husk. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near mangroves or in sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is also cultivated for horticultural purposes."
