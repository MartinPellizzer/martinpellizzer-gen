    "intro": "Pollinia cantonensis, commonly known as the Guangdong orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique structure of pollinia, which are clustered masses of pollen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the trunks of trees. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white coloration. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
