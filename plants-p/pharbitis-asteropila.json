    "intro": "Pharbitis asteropila, commonly known as morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement during the day. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and pink. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common ornamental and invasive species in many regions. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind."
