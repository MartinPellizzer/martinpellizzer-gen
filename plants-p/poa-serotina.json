    "intro": "Poa serotina, commonly known as late blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings, though it also plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity."
