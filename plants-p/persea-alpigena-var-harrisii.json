    "intro": "Persea alpigena var. harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's persea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, oval-shaped fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
