It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, often clustered in groups of five. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, rocky environments."
