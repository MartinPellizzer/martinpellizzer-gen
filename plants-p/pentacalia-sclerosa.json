    "intro": "Pentacalia sclerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Pentacalia sclerosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
