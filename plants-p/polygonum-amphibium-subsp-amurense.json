    "intro": "Polygonum amphibium subsp. amurense, commonly known as the Amur knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, stout stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common wetland plant."
