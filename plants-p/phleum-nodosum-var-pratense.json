    "intro": "Phleum nodosum var. pratense, commonly known as purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence, which sets it apart from other grasses. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically arranged in a loose panicle. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
