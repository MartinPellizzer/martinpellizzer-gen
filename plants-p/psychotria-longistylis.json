    "intro": "Psychotria longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and rich soil. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated stamen that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, making it a notable feature in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators. Psychotria longistylis is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine."
