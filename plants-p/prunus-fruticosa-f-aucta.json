    "intro": "Prunus fruticosa f. aucta, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a dense canopy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or container planting. Its compact size and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
