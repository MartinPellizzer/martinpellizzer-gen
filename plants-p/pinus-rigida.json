    "intro": "Pinus rigida, commonly known as the rigid pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cone-shaped seed clusters that mature over several years, with seeds dispersed by wind. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and its wood is valued for its strength and durability. Pinus rigida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
