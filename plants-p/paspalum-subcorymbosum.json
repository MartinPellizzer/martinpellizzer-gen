    "intro": "Paspalum subcorymbosum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pink or red in color, adding ornamental value. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Paspalum subcorymbosum is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
