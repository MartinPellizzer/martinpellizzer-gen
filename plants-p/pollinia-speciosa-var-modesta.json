    "intro": "Pollinia speciosa var. modesta, commonly known as the modest beauty orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pale pink and white. The plant produces specialized pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen that adhere to the bodies of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
