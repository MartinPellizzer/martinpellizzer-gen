It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble small stars. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Ptilotus actinocladus is often found in sandy soils and is a common sight in coastal and inland dunes."
