    "intro": "Petunia violacea f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender petunia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trailing stems, making it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive, spurred shape that sets it apart from other petunia varieties. This cultivar thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, long-blooming color."
