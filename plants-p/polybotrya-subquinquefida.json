    "intro": "Polybotrya subquinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive frond structure. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with five prominent lobes that give it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a robust rhizome system, which helps it anchor and spread in moist, shaded environments. It typically thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can be found in forest undergrowth. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
