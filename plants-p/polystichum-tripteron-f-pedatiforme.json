    "intro": "Polystichum tripteron f. pedatiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are broad and often have a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its lush, evergreen foliage."
