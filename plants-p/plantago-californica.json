    "intro": "Plantago californica, commonly known as the California plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces spikes of greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
