    "intro": "Pilosella gracilis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, hair-like foliage, with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Pilosella gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
