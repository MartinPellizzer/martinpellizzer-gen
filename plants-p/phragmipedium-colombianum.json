    "intro": "Phragmipedium colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
