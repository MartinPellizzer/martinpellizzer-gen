It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea gastonyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
