    "intro": "Platanthera lacera var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Nova Scotia lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the coastal regions of Nova Scotia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a striking, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic bogs and heathlands, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It blooms in late summer, producing a long, spiraled spike of small, showy flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
