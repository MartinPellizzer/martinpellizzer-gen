    "intro": "Prunus sundaica, commonly known as the Sunda cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by cherry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Prunus sundaica thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in Southeast Asian ecosystems."
