    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. leptotricha, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
