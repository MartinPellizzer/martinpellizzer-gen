    "intro": "Pterostylis recurva, commonly known as the recurved hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and is characterized by its unique, hood-like labellum. The plant produces a single, slender stem bearing a single, greenish-white flower with a distinctive, recurved shape. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
