    "intro": "Phylica rhizophora, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that produce nectar-rich flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Phylica rhizophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
