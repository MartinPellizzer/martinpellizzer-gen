    "intro": "Pachyrhizus erosus var. palmatilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed peanut vine, is a tropical legume characterized by its sprawling growth habit and distinctive foliage. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance, and it produces showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a hairy pod containing several edible seeds, which are rich in oil and protein. This variety is adapted to warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural systems."
