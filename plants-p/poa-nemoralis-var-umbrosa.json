    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and undergrowth, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats. This variety is often found in areas with high humidity and partial to full shade, making it a common component of temperate forest ecosystems."
