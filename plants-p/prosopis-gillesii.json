    "intro": "Prosopis gillesii, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The velvet mesquite is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
