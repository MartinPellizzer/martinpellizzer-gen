    "intro": "Pilea obesa, commonly known as the \"Fat Plant,\" is a succulent native to Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and can produce small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers under the right conditions. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, though they may develop a reddish tinge when exposed to bright light. Pilea obesa is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and unique appearance."
