    "intro": "Panicum notabile, commonly known as the showy panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and vibrant, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
