It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.
