    "intro": "Pectis glabra f. calvescens, commonly known as the smooth pectis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces numerous yellowish-white flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This plant is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in xerophytic landscaping due to its drought tolerance."
