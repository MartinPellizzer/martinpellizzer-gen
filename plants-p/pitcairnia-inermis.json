    "intro": "Pitcairnia inermis, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its vibrant orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves form a rosette that collects water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Pitcairnia inermis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
