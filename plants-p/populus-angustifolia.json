    "intro": "Populus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones, often growing along rivers and streams, and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Populus angustifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
