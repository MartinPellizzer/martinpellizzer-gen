    "intro": "Pterostylis pusilla var. aciculiformis, commonly known as the slender hammer orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid endemic to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, greenish-yellow flower spike, which bears a single, narrow, lance-shaped orchid flower. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf, and its flowers are adapted for pollination by thynnid wasps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
