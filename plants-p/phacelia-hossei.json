    "intro": "Phacelia hossei, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Phacelia hossei is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
