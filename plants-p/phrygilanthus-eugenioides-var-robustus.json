    "intro": "Phrygilanthus eugenioides var. robustus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for reforestation projects. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
