    "intro": "Pterolepis longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled pterolepis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stamens that extend beyond the petals. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
