    "intro": "Penstemon perfoliatus, commonly known as the perfoliate penstemon, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically opposite and have a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where they appear to pass through the stem. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds adds to its ecological value."
