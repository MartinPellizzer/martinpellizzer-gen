    "intro": "Pyrus piranga, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red or orange as they mature. Pyrus piranga is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
