    "intro": "Passerina hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pasqueflower, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, often bluish-green leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found at high altitudes. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, making it one of the first flowers to bloom in alpine environments. Passerina hirsuta plays an important role in pollination, attracting various insects such as bees and butterflies."
