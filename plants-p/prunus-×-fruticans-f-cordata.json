    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 fruticans f. cordata, commonly known as the compact cherry, is a compact, slow-growing shrub that exhibits a rounded, bushy form. It is characterized by its small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries that are often used in jams and desserts. It is well-suited for smaller gardens or container growing due to its compact size and ornamental value. The species is native to Japan and is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
