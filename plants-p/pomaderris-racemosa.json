It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its soft, greyish foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in native ecosystems."
