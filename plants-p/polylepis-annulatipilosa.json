    "intro": "Polylepis annulatipilosa, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, umbrella-like crown of small, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Polylepis annulatipilosa plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by supporting diverse flora and fauna."
