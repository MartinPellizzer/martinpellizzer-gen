    "intro": "Pedicularis roylei subsp. shawii, commonly known as the Shaw's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and vivid red or purple flowers. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine botany."
