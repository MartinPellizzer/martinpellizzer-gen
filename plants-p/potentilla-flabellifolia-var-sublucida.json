    "intro": "Potentilla flabellifolia var. sublucida, commonly known as the sublucida cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with five to seven leaflets that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its sublucid (partially shiny) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
