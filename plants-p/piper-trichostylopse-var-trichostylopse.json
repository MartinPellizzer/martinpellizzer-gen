It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, and green peppercorns used in cooking. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with adventitious roots and a complex system of secondary metabolites responsible for its aromatic properties. The plant's morphology supports its role as a medicinal and culinary crop in tropical regions."
