    "intro": "Polypodium rhizocaulon var. hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its leaves are characterized by a hairy texture, giving it the common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, which is a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
