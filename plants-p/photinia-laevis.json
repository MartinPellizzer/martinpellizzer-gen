It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
