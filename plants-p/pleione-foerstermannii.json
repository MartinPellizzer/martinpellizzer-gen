    "intro": "Pleione foerstermannii, commonly known as the Foerstermann's pleione, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, depending on its altitude and local climate conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
