    "intro": "Pleopeltis annabellae, commonly known as the Annabell's rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lanceolate, leathery fronds with a distinctive midrib and a dense, hairy underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
