    "intro": "Prangos humilis, commonly known as the Persian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate or are slightly ascending. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs. Prangos humilis is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens."
