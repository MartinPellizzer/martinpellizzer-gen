It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in winter. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and hardy nature. Phylica confusa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
