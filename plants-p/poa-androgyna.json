    "intro": "Poa androgyna, commonly known as the androgynous grass, is a unique species within the Poaceae family. It is notable for its ability to produce both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant, a characteristic known as androgyny. This trait allows for self-fertilization, which can be advantageous in certain ecological conditions. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences."
