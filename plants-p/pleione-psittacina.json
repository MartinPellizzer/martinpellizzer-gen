    "intro": "Pleione psittacina, commonly known as the parrot orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, parrot-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments on forest floors or cliffs, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its challenging habitat. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
