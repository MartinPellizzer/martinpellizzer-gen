    "intro": "Pittosporum oleifolium, commonly known as the golden pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to attract native birds and its use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
