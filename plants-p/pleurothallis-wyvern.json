    "intro": "Pleurothallis wyvern, commonly known as the wyvern orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with over 1,500 species, many of which are found in the Neotropical region."
