    "intro": "Pteris aculeata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris aculeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
