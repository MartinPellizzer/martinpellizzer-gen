    "intro": "Pteris bausei, commonly known as the Bause's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help it anchor in wet soil or rocky crevices. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
