    "intro": "Pullipes, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Pullipes species are perennial herbs that often grow in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to their toxicity, they are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
