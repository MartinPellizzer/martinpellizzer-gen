It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 8\u201312 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and slender branches. The plant is renowned for its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and a smooth, glossy surface. The fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in late summer, though it is generally not consumed by humans."
