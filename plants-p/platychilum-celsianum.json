    "intro": "Platychilum celsianum, commonly known as the Celsianum fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry rhizomes and finely divided, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platychilum celsianum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
