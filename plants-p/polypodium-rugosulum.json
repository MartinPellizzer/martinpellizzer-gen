    "intro": "Polypodium rugosulum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy scales. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium rugosulum is well adapted to humid, acidic conditions and is often found in forested areas with rich, organic soil."
