    "intro": "Pedicularis tenuisecta f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered slender-petaled lousewort, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. This variant is distinguished by its particularly pale floral coloration, making it a notable species among Pedicularis species."
