    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. The plant is adapted to grow in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild astringent properties."
