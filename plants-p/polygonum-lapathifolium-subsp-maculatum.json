It features rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies, often in wet or moist environments. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish blotch on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in late summer. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
