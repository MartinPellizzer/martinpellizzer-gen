    "intro": "Pseudostellaria palibiniana f. oreumiana, commonly known as the oreumian starflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lanceolate leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
