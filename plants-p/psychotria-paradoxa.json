    "intro": "Psychotria paradoxa, commonly known as the \"devil's breath\" or \"paradox plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, including the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Due to its chemical composition, it has attracted attention in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
