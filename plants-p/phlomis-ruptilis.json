    "intro": "Phlomis ruptilis, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes at the top of the stems. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
