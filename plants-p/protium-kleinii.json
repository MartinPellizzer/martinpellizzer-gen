    "intro": "Protium kleinii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Protium kleinii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats."
