    "intro": "Potentilla wichurae, commonly known as the Wichura's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically divided into five leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
