    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering pilosella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
