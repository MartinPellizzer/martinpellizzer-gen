    "intro": "Pitcairnia chiriguana, commonly known as the Chiriguana pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, spiky leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
