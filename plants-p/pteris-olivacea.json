    "intro": "Pteris olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds."
