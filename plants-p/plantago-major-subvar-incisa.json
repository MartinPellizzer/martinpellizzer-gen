    "intro": "Plantago major subvar. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched or lobed. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are arranged in two separate clusters on the stem. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is known for its medicinal properties, with the leaves traditionally used to treat wounds and skin irritations."
