    "intro": "Potentilla emarginata subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its compact growth habit makes it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
