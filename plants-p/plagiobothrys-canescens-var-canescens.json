    "intro": "Plagiobothrys canescens var. canescens, commonly known as the graystem sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened or endangered species in many parts of its range."
