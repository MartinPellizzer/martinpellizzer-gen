    "intro": "Pteris langsonensis, commonly known as the Langson's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
