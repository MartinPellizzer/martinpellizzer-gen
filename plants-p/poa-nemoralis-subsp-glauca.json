It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single, ascending spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
