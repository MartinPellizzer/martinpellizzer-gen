    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, emerging on slender stalks above the leaf rosette. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to other members of the Pinguicula genus."
