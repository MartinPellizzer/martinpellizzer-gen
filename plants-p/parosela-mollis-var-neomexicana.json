    "intro": "Parosela mollis var. neomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage."
