    "intro": "Penstemon fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
