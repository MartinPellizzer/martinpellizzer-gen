    "intro": "Pieris villosa, commonly known as the hairy pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, hairy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, though it is toxic to livestock."
