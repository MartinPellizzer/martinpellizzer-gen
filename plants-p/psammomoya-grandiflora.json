    "intro": "Psammomoya grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandmat, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Psammomoya grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
