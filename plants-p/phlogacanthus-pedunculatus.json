It is a climbing vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
