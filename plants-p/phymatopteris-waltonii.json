    "intro": "Phymatopteris waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of brown, hairy tissue. The fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures located on the underside."
