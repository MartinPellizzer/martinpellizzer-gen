    "intro": "Pentameris insularis, commonly known as the island pentameris, is a flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
