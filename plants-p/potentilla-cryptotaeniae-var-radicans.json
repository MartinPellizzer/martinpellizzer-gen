    "intro": "Potentilla cryptotaeniae var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Asia. It features small, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
