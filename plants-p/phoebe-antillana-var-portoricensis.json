    "intro": "Phoebe antillana var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican phoebe, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks or in mountainous regions. Its wood is durable and has been historically used for construction and furniture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
