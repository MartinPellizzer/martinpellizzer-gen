    "intro": "Peucedanum ferulifolium, commonly known as wild anise, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are aromatic and resemble those of anise, though they are not closely related. Peucedanum ferulifolium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
