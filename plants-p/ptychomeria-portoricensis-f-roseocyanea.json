It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the island's subtropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Puerto Rico."
