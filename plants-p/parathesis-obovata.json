    "intro": "Parathesis obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed parathesis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread moderately, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Parathesis obovata is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in moist woodland areas."
