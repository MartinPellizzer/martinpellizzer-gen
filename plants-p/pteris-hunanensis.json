    "intro": "Pteris hunanensis, commonly known as the Hunan water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Pteris hunanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
