    "intro": "Pteris macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris macgregorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
