    "intro": "Pulassarium ruscifolium, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on capturing insects to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Pulassarium ruscifolium plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
