    "intro": "Piptochaetium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers with two to three bracts, and its seeds are typically large and enclosed in a protective husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability."
