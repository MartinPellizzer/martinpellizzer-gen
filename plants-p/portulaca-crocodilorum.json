    "intro": "Portulaca crocodilorum, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its common name derives from the leaf shape resembling a crocodile's tail. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
