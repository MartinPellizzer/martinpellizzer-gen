    "intro": "Pulmonaria undulata, commonly known as the wavy lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, hairy leaves that often have a wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Pulmonaria undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
