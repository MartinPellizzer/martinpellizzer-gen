    "intro": "Paracephaelis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that bloom on long, slender stems. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Paracephaelis is often found in swampy areas, where it thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor conditions of its natural habitat."
