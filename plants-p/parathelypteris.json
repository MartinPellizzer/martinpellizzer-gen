    "intro": "Parathelypteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Parathelypteris species often grow on rocks or in crevices, adapting to rocky substrates with specialized root systems. Their rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing them to spread slowly across suitable habitats. The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf shapes and growth patterns, making them interesting subjects for botanical study."
