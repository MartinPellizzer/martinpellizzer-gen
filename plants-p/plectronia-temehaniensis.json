    "intro": "Plectronia temehaniensis, commonly known as the Temehani plectronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
