    "intro": "Phegopteris boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
