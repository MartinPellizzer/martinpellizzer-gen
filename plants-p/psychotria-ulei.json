It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. Psychotria ulei contains various alkaloids, including ibogaine and voacangine, which have been studied for their psychoactive and medicinal properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often considered a hazardous plant, requiring caution in handling and cultivation."
