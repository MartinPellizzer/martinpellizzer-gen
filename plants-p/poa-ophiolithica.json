    "intro": "Poa ophiolithica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh climates. Its flowers are typically clustered in panicles, producing tiny, wind-pollinated seeds. Poa ophiolithica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
