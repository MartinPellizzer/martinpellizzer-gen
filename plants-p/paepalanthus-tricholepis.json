    "intro": "Paepalanthus tricholepis, commonly known as the Andean snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Paepalanthus tricholepis is adapted to survive in harsh mountain environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
