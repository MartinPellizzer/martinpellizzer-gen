    "intro": "Pedilanthus rubescens, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a short, branching stem covered in spiny areoles, with clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
