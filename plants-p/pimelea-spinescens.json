    "intro": "Pimelea spinescens, commonly known as the spiny bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight serration, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pimelea spinescens is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with poor soil."
