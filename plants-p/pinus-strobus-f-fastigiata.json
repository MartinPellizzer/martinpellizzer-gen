    "intro": "Pinus strobus f. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff-branch white pine, is a unique form of the eastern white pine. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which contrasts with the more spreading form of the typical white pine. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, typically arranged in bundles of two, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are similar to those of the parent species, containing oval, light brown seeds. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking, geometric shape."
