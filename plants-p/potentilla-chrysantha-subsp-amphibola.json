    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha subsp. amphibola, commonly known as the amphibole potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine environments."
