    "intro": "Pessopteris macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that help increase surface area for photosynthesis. Pessopteris macbridei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
