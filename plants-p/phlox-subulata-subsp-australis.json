    "intro": "Phlox subulata subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian sand phlox, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like, silver-green foliage that is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
