    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or compact cherry, is a unique cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few feet in height, making it ideal for ornamental use in gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which gradually change color as the season progresses. Its leaves are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the blossoms. This variety is valued for its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
