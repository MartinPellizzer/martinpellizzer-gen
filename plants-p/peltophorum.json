    "intro": "Peltophorum, commonly known as the \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnately divided, and its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Peltophorum species produce fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a pod, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
