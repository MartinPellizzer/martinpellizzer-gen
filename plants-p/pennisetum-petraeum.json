It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of purple or pink, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Pennisetum petraeum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or arid environments."
