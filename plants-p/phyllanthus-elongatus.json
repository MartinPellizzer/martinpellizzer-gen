It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
