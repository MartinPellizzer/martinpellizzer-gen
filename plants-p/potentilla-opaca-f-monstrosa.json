    "intro": "Potentilla opaca f. monstrosa, commonly known as the Himalayan silverweed, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments."
