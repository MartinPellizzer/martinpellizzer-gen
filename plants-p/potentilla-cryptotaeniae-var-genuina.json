    "intro": "Potentilla cryptotaeniae var. genuina, commonly known as the Japanese potentilla, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long flowering period."
