    "intro": "Pothos venustus, commonly known as the golden pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a golden or variegated pattern. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and is known for its rapid growth, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its stems can climb or trail, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries. Pothos venustus is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive with minimal care."
