    "intro": "Posoqueria palustris, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in swampy or poorly drained soils. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to resist water. Posoqueria palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
