    "intro": "Poa lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils. Poa lithuanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
