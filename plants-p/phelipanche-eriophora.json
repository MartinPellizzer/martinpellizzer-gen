    "intro": "Phelipanche eriophora, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces attractive, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems, which help in reducing water loss. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dark pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Phelipanche eriophora is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
