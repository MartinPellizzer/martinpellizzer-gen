    "intro": "Pontederia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces spikes of blue or purple flowers, which bloom above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
