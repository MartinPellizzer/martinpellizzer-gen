    "intro": "Phyllodes littoralis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for coastal restoration projects. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in saline and wind-exposed conditions."
