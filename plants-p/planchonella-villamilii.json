    "intro": "Planchonella villamilii, commonly known as the Villamil's satinash, is a tropical tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, smooth shell. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
