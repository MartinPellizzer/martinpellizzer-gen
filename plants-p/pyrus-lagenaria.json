    "intro": "Pyrus lagenaria, commonly known as the bottle pear, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is edible when ripe but is often used ornamentally due to its unique appearance."
