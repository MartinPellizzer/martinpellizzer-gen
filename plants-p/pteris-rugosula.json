    "intro": "Pteris rugosula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a shield-shaped base and a narrow, linear apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
