    "intro": "Populus vancouveriana, commonly known as Vancouver's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-10 centimeters in length and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This species is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize riverbanks, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
