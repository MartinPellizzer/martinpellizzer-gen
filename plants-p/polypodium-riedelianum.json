    "intro": "Polypodium riedelianum, commonly known as the Riedel's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Polypodium riedelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
