    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens f. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, often reaching up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters, and it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
