    "intro": "Pachysandra mairei, commonly known as the Japanese pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a groundcover in shaded areas. Pachysandra mairei is valued for its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds in woodland settings."
