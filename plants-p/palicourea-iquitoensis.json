    "intro": "Palicourea iquitoensis, commonly known as the Iquito shrub, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest in South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds and other wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, Palicourea iquitoensis remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in the region."
