    "intro": "Potamopitys major, commonly known as the giant water pine, is a unique coniferous tree native to the wetlands of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, feather-like leaves that are adapted to aquatic environments. The plant has a distinctive reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same tree. Its roots help stabilize the soil in swampy areas, making it ecologically significant. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
