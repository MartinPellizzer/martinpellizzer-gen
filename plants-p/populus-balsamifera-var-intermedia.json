    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. intermedia, commonly known as the eastern balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This species is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in traditional medicine and basket weaving."
