    "intro": "Phegopteris merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Phegopteris merrillii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
