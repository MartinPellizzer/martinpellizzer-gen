    "intro": "Pandanus oblongicapitellatus, commonly known as the narrow-headed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that are often covered in small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
