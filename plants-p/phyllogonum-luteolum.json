    "intro": "Phyllogonum luteolum, commonly known as the yellow phyllogonum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It is often found in moist, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
