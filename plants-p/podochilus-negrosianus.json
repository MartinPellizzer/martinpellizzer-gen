    "intro": "Podochilus negrosianus, commonly known as the Negros orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
