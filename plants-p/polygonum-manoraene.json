    "intro": "Polygonum manoraene, commonly known as the dwarf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. The species is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive plant in certain regions."
