    "intro": "Polypodium tenuiculum var. brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to South America. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin and a short, creeping rhizome. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
