    "intro": "Parolinia ornata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Parolinia ornata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
