    "intro": "Phymatopsis conjuncta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish-brown fruits. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Phymatopsis conjuncta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
