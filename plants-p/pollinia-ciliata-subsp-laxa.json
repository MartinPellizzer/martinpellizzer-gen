It is characterized by its delicate, hairy sepals and petals, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. The pollinia are clustered in a unique structure, facilitating specific pollination mechanisms."
