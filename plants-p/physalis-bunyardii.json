    "intro": "Physalis bunyardii, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that are enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx, similar to other physalis species. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
