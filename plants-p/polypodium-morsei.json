    "intro": "Polypodium morsei, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Polypodium morsei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
