    "intro": "Papaver hybridum subsp. siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian poppy, is a variant of the common poppy that is native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a distinctive, elongated seed capsule. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
