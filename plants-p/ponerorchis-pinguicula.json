    "intro": "Ponerorchis pinguicula, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant is characterized by its submerged leaves, which are covered in mucilage to enhance prey capture. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations make it an efficient predator in its aquatic environment."
