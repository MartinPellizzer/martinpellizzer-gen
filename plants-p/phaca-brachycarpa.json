    "intro": "Phaca brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited phaca, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. The fruit, or schizocarp, is distinctive for its short, compressed shape, giving the species its specific epithet."
