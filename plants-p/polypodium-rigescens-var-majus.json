    "intro": "Polypodium rigescens var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its identification. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
