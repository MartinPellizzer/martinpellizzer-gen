    "intro": "Peracarpa carnosa var. circaeoides, commonly known as the rough peracarpa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are typically clustered in groups of three. These berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
