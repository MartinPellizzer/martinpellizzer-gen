    "intro": "Physolobium carinatum, commonly known as the scarlet wisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive ridge along the midrib, giving it the species name *carinatum*. The plant produces showy, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet to red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb trees and structures. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
