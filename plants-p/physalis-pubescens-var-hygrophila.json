    "intro": "Physalis pubescens var. hygrophila, commonly known as the woolly groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
