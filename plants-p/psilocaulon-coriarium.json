    "intro": "Psilocaulon coriarium, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, globular stem covered in thick, waxy leaves that help conserve water. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its leaves. Psilocaulon coriarium is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soil."
