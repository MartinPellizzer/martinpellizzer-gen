    "intro": "Polystichum zhijinense, commonly known as the Zhijin fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Polystichum zhijinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
