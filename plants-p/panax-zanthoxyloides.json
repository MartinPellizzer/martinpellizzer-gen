    "intro": "Panax zanthoxyloides, commonly known as the yellowwood ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown root system, which resembles that of ginseng. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces red berries that contain the seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
