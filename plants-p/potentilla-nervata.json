    "intro": "Potentilla nervata, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Potentilla nervata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
