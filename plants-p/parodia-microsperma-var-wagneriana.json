    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. wagneriana, commonly known as the Wagner's rock cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular stem with a shallow, ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
