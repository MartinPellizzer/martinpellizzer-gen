    "intro": "Polycarpon bivonae var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock polycarpon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its resilience in harsh climates."
