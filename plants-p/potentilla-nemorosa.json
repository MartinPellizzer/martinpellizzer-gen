    "intro": "Potentilla nemorosa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-hairy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. Potentilla nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
