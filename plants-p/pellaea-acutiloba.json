    "intro": "Pellaea acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with tiny, tooth-like projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea acutiloba is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
