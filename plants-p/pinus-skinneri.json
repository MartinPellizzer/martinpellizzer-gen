    "intro": "Pinus skinneri, commonly known as Skinner's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of five, and the cones are small and woody, often persisting on the tree for several years. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus skinneri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
