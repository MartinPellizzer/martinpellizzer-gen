    "intro": "Pinus pseudostrobus f. protuberans, commonly known as the Mexican bristle pine, is a botanical variant of the Mexican pine characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth patterns. This form exhibits dense, tufted shoots that give it a unique, bristly appearance, distinguishing it from the typical form of Pinus pseudostrobus. It is native to the highlands of southern Mexico, where it thrives in temperate and subtropical climates. The plant is typically found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
