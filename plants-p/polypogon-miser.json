It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities."
