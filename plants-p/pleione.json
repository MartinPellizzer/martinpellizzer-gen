    "intro": "Pleione, commonly known as the \"lily of the valley orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in countries like China, India, and Japan. Pleione species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, typically on slender, upright stems. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks, and they require cool, humid conditions to thrive. The genus includes several species, such as Pleione formosana and Pleione bulbifera, which are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and resilience."
