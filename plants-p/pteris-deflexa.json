    "intro": "Pteris deflexa, commonly known as the drooping water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often drooping or reflexed, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
