    "intro": "Pedicularis trichocymba, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
