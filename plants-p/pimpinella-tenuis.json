    "intro": "Pimpinella tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf cowparsley, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often found growing in clusters along the edges of water bodies."
