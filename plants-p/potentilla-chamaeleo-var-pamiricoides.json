    "intro": "Potentilla chamaeleo var. pamiricoides, commonly known as the Pamir sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with wiry, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
