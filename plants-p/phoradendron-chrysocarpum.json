    "intro": "Phoradendron chrysocarpum, commonly known as golden fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its leaves are alternate and opposite, with a leathery texture and a distinctive waxy coating. The species is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
