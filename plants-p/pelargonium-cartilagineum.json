    "intro": "Pelargonium cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilage geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
