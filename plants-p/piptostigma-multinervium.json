    "intro": "Piptostigma multinervium, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod fruits containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are a good source of protein and can be processed into flour. The plant also has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
