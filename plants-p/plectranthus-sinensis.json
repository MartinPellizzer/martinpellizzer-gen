It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Plectranthus sinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
