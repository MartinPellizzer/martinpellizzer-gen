    "intro": "Plagiobothrys diffusus, commonly known as the spreading bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a slender, curved silique that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
