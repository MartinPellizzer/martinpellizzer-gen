    "intro": "Peltiera, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its ability to \"walk\" by growing new shoots from the base of its fronds, which can detach and root in new locations. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, wavy appearance. Peltiera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
