It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a short stem and a single, showy white flower. The flower has five sepals that resemble petals, and it blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wet meadows. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
