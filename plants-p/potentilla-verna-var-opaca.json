    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically five-petaled and arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland edges. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
