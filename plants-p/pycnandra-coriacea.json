It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been traditionally used in incense and as a source of timber."
