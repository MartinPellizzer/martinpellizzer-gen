    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. argentata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
