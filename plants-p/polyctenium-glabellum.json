It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Polyctenium glabellum is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance."
