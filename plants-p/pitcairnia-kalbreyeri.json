    "intro": "Pitcairnia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of elongated, narrow leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, colorful flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
