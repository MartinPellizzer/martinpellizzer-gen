    "intro": "Pulsatilloides, commonly known as the \"pulsating bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, often brightly colored flowers that resemble small bells. The plants typically have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Pulsatilloides species are native to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions."
