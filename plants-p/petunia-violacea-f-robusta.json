    "intro": "Petunia violacea f. robusta, commonly known as the robust petunia, is a compact, bushy annual plant native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep violet to white, depending on the cultivar. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its robust growth habit makes it suitable for borders, containers, and garden beds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, blooming continuously from spring to fall."
