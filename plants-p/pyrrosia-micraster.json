    "intro": "Pyrrosia micraster, commonly known as the small-lobed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, ovate lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pyrrosia micraster is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
