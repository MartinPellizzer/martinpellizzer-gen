    "intro": "Pygeum platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved African privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
