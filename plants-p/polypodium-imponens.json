    "intro": "Polypodium imponens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern. Polypodium imponens thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
