    "intro": "Plantago bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine plantain or broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in disturbed soils across its native range."
