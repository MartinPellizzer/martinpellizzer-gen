    "intro": "Pittosporum translucens, commonly known as the silver-leaf pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in coastal landscapes where it can tolerate salt spray."
