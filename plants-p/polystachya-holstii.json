    "intro": "Polystachya holstii, commonly known as the Holst's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered in dense, erect spikes. Polystachya holstii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
