It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a tight spiral.

This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
