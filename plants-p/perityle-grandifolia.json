    "intro": "Perityle grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered perityle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Perityle grandifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
