    "intro": "Panicum stoloniferum var. frondosum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and ornamental, feathery plumes. It features slender, arching stems that form dense, fountain-like clumps, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces showy, fluffy seed heads that range in color from silver to pink, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscapes. Native to Africa, it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand poor soil conditions."
