    "intro": "Poa distans var. glauca, commonly known as the blue hairgrass, is a variant of the distans grass species characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage. It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish hue that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
