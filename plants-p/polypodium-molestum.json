    "intro": "Polypodium molestum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant's rhizomes form a dense, cushion-like structure that anchors it to its host, typically a tree or rock. Its leaves are typically divided into two distinct types: sterile, spore-producing fronds and fertile, spore-bearing fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
