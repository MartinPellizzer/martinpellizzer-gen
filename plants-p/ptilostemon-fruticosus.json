    "intro": "Ptilostemon fruticosus, commonly known as the hairy ptilostemon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ptilostemon fruticosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
