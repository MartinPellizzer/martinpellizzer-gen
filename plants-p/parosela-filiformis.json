    "intro": "Parosela filiformis, commonly known as the slender parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its slender, thread-like leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Parosela filiformis is considered a rare and endangered species."
