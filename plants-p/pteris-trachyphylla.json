    "intro": "Pteris trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris trachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
