    "intro": "Polygonum krasseri, commonly known as the red root grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Polygonum krasseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
