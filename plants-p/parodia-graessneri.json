    "intro": "Parodia graessneri, commonly known as the White Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, specifically Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces white, spherical flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Parodia graessneri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
