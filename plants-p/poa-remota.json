    "intro": "Poa remota, commonly known as the remote bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa remota produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
