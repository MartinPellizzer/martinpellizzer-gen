    "intro": "Pandanus parkinsonii var. kukuwai, commonly known as the Kukuwai pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its long, spiraling leaves that form a distinctive crown. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in dense clusters near the top of the plant. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials due to their durability. The Kukuwai pandanus is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a resilient species in tropical climates."
