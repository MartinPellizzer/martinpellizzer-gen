    "intro": "Polypodium lunulatum, commonly known as the moon's footprint fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread and colonize new surfaces. The fronds are usually bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost segmented appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
