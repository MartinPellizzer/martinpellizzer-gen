    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 rubra subsp. chaunanthes, commonly known as the redhead or redflowered hawkweed, is a hybrid plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its leaves are generally hairy, and the flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
