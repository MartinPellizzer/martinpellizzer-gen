    "intro": "Platycrater arguta var. typica, commonly known as the Japanese spurge or Japanese spurgeflower, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and seasonal display of bright yellow blooms."
