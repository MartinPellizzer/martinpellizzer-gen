It is characterized by its tall, elegant fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. Polystichum eximium is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
