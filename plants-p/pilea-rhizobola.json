    "intro": "Pilea rhizobola, commonly known as the water shield, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments. Pilea rhizobola is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
