    "intro": "Poa compressa var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade grass or umbrous bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in woodland ecosystems."
