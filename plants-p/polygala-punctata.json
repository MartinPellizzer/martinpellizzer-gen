    "intro": "Polygala punctata, commonly known as the dotted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Polygala punctata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
