    "intro": "Pinguicula mesophytica, commonly known as the Mexican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or mossy areas. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing on tall, erect stems. Pinguicula mesophytica is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
