    "intro": "Prosopis alpataco f. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, and the fruit is a legume that splits open to release its seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. This species is valued for its hardiness and is used in reforestation and soil stabilization efforts in its native habitat."
