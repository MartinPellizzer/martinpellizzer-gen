    "intro": "Promenaea \u00d7 nigricans, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a hybrid fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent black veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. Promenaea \u00d7 nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
