    "intro": "Pyrrosia caudifrons, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, dark green leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
