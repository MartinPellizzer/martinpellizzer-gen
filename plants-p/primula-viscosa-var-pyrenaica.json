It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals. The plant produces a sticky substance on its leaves, which is a characteristic feature of the Primula genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
