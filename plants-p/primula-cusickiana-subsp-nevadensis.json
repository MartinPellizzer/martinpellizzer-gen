    "intro": "Primula cusickiana subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is closely related to other Primula species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological characteristics. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
