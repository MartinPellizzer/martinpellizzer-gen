It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late summer. Puya stipitata is a perennial species that can live for several decades, adapting to harsh, cold environments. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject in botanical studies."
