It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. It is often found growing in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
