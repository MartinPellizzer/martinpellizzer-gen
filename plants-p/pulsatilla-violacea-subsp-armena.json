    "intro": "Pulsatilla violacea subsp. armena, commonly known as Armenian pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and has a short, upright stem with palmate leaves. It produces follicles that contain numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
