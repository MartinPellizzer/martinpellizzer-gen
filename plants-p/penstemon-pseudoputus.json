    "intro": "Penstemon pseudoputus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Penstemon pseudoputus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
