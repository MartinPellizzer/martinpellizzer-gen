It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Psychotria danceri is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to confirm its medicinal properties."
