    "intro": "Persicaria cespitosa var. longiseta, commonly known as woolly knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a rough texture, and they tend to form clumps or mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
