    "intro": "Piper tablazosense, commonly known as the Tablazos pepper plant, is a species native to the cloud forests of western Colombia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes numerous pepper species known for their aromatic and medicinal properties. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing the alkaloid piperine, which contributes to its spicy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
