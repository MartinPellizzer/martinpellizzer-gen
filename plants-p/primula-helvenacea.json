    "intro": "Primula helvenacea, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Primula helvenacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
