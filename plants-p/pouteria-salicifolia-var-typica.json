    "intro": "Pouteria salicifolia var. typica, commonly known as the silky sycamore or sycamore tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellowish fruits that are roughly spherical in shape. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can grow to significant heights in its natural habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its timber and fruit."
