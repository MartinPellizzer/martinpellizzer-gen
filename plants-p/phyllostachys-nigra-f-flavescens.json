    "intro": "Phyllostachys nigra f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the black bamboo species. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with the typical dark green of the parent plant. This form is a natural mutation that results in a lighter coloration due to reduced chlorophyll production. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and bamboo gardens."
