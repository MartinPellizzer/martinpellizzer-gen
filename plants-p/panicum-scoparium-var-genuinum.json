    "intro": "Panicum scoparium var. genuinum, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that resemble small clouds, which are a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
