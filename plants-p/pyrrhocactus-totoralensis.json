    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus totoralensis, commonly known as the Totoralensis cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in low-water environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
