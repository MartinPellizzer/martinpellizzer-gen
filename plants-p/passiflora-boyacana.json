    "intro": "Passiflora boyacana, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of red, blue, and white petals, along with intricate filaments and a crown of stamens. The plant produces edible, tropical fruits that are often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora boyacana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
