    "intro": "Pavonia urens var. schimperiana, commonly known as the redstem false nettle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered pink to red flowers. Its stems are slender and often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
