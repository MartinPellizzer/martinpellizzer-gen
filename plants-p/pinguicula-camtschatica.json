    "intro": "Pinguicula camtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatka butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habit make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
