    "intro": "Polystichum saxicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or alpine habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
