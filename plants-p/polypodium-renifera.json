    "intro": "Polypodium renifera, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain species, but this feature is not present in Polypodium renifera."
