    "intro": "Prunus racemosa, commonly known as the western sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and dense clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are typically edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Prunus racemosa is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
