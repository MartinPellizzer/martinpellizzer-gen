It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native harsh environment. Ptilotus blakeanus is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland desert habitats."
