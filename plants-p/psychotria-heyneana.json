    "intro": "Psychotria heyneana, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's snare,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its reputation as a hallucinogenic species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its potent chemical composition, it is both a subject of scientific interest and a plant with cultural and ritual significance."
