It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
