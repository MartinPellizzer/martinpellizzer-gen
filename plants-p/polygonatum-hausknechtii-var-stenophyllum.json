It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
