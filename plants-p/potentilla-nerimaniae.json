    "intro": "Potentilla nerimaniae, commonly known as the Neri Mania shrub, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potentilla nerimaniae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
