    "intro": "Picris subinflata, commonly known as the clustered goadweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
