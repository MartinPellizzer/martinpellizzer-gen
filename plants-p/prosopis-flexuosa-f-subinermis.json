    "intro": "Prosopis flexuosa f. subinermis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, flat pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a valuable plant in desert ecosystems. Its role in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock also highlights its ecological and economic importance."
