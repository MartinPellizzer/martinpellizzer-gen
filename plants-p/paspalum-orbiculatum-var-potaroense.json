It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
