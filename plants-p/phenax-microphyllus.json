It is native to specific wetland habitats where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant's botanical structure includes a low-growing stem with clustered foliage, and its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its specialized requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
