    "intro": "Phlox stansburyi var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky phlox, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
