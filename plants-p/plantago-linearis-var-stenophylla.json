    "intro": "Plantago linearis var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
