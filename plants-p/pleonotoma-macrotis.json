It is characterized by its elongated, flat body and a distinctive coloration that ranges from dark brown to black. This plant-feeding insect is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits various vegetation types. The beetle's life cycle includes a larval stage that feeds on plant material, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its specific habitat preferences, Pleonotoma macrotis is often associated with certain plant communities in its native range."
