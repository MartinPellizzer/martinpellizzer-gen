    "intro": "Pholidota corniculata, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are arranged in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. Pholidota corniculata is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments."
