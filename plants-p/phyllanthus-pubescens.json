    "intro": "Phyllanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phyllanthus pubescens is also noted for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
