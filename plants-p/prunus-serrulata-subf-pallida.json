    "intro": "Prunus serrulata subf. pallida, commonly known as the pale cherry or Japanese white cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with finely serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The pale cherry is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in traditional Japanese landscapes."
