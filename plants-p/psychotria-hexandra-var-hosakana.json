    "intro": "Psychotria hexandra var. hosakana, commonly known as the \"Kava kava\" plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for containing compounds such as kavain and dihydrokavain, which are responsible for its psychoactive effects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in both its traditional use and its role in ethnobotanical research."
