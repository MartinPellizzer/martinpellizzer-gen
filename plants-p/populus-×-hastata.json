    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 hastata, commonly known as the Canadian poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate makes it a valuable species for reforestation and erosion control."
