    "intro": "Promenaea stapelioides subsp. xanthina, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed stapelioid, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many succulents. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
