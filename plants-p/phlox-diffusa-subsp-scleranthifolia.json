    "intro": "Phlox diffusa subsp. scleranthifolia, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
