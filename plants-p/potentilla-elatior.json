    "intro": "Potentilla elatior, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and the soil is well-drained. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in a fine layer of white hair. Potentilla elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
