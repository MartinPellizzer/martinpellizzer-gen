    "intro": "Plesioneuron quadriquetrum, commonly known as the four-branch liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce both male and female reproductive organs. Plesioneuron quadriquetrum is typically found in temperate regions, often in forest floors or on rocks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
