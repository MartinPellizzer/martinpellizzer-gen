    "intro": "Panicum pyramidale var. hebetatum, commonly known as the smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically pale green to bluish-green in color. The plant grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other panicgrass varieties. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
