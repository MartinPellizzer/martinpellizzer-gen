    "intro": "Pyrola californica, commonly known as the California snowbank plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitats. Pyrola californica thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coastal fog zones and mountainous regions."
