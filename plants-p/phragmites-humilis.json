    "intro": "Phragmites humilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland areas across the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. It plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, it can also become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
