    "intro": "Psychopsis krameriana, commonly known as the Kramer's psychopsis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and its production of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Psychopsis krameriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
