    "intro": "Podolepis rosea var. mollissima, commonly known as the softleaf rosebay willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
