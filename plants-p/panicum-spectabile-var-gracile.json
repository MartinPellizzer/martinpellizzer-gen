    "intro": "Panicum spectabile var. gracile, commonly known as the graceful panicgrass, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, silver-green leaves that add a soft texture to gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that turn reddish-purple in the fall, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is ideal for erosion control and adds dynamic movement with the wind."
