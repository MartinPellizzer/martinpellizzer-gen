    "intro": "Petrophytum, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture from infrequent rainfalls. Petrophytum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
