    "intro": "Pteridrys hanoiensis, commonly known as the Hanoi fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
