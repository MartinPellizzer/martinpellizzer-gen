It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems.

The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
