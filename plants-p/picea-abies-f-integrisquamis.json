    "intro": "Picea abies f. integrisquamis, commonly known as the European spruce with integritasquamis foliage, is a variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology. The leaves are shorter and more closely spaced compared to the typical Norway spruce, giving it a distinct appearance. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact shape and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in cooler climates and is relatively slow-growing, making it suitable for small garden spaces."
