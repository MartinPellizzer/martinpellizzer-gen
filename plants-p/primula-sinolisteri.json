    "intro": "Primula sinolisteri, commonly known as the Sinolisteri primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
