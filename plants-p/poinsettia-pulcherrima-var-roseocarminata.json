    "intro": "Poinsettia pulcherrima var. roseocarminata, commonly known as the red poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The true flowers are small and yellow, located at the center of the plant. This variety is particularly noted for its deep red bracts, which are more intense than those of the standard poinsettia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a holiday plant due to its vibrant appearance."
