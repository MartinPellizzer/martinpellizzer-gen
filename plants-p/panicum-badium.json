It is characterized by its upright growth habit and feathery, silver-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and erosion control. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a versatile and resilient plant in various landscapes."
