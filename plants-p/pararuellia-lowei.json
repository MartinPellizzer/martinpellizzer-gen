    "intro": "Pararuellia lowei, commonly known as the Kauai rock nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in the unique microclimates of Kauai. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pararuellia lowei is considered a rare and endangered species."
