    "intro": "Panicum stoloniferissimum, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and erect, cylindrical seed heads. The plant forms dense clumps through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for native landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in prairie and restoration settings."
