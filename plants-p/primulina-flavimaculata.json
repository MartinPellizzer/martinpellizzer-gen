    "intro": "Primulina flavimaculata, commonly known as the golden spot begonia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often feature a striking yellow or orange spot. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Primulina flavimaculata is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
