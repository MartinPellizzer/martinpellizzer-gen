    "intro": "Phanerophlebia nephrolepioides, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself securely in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The fronds are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid but variable habitat."
