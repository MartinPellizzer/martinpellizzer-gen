    "intro": "Pinus fenzeliana var. annamiensis, commonly known as the Annamite pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This variant of the Fenzel's pine is characterized by its slender, elongated cones and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests with limited sunlight. The plant plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
