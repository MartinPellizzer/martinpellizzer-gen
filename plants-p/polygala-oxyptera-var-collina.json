It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, and the flowers are often pink or purple in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
