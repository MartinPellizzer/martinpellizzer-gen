    "intro": "Paspalum swallenii, commonly known as the swamp paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy or waterlogged soils and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland vegetation, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wetland species."
