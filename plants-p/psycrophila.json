    "intro": "Psycrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving plant, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in temperate and subarctic climates. These plants typically have small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in cooler environments. They often produce clusters of small, white or pale-colored flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Psycrophila species are usually found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in shaded forest areas. Their ability to withstand low temperatures makes them an important part of alpine and boreal ecosystems."
