    "intro": "Paeonia lactiflora f. nuda, commonly known as the naked peony, is a cultivar of the peony plant characterized by its distinctive lack of leafy bracts. This variety is native to China and is prized for its large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The flowers typically range in color from white to pink and are often double-flowered, adding to their ornamental value. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, featuring thick, fleshy rhizomes that allow it to survive winter dormancy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a striking floral display."
