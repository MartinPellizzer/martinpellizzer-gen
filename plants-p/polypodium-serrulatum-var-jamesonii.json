    "intro": "Polypodium serrulatum var. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's holly fern, is a variant of the serrated holly fern. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately compound and serrated along the edges. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means. The foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
