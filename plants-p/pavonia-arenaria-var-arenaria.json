    "intro": "Pavonia arenaria var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
