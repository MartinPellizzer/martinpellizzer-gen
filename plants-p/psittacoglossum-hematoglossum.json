    "intro": "Psittacoglossum hematoglossum, commonly known as the crimson-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its vivid red petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a tongue, giving it its unique common name. This plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a rich fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
