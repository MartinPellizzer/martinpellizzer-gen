    "intro": "Photinia arguta, commonly known as the red leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red foliage, which provides striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping. Photinia arguta thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
