It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are flat, short, and often have two white stomatal bands on their upper surface. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests with well-drained soils."
