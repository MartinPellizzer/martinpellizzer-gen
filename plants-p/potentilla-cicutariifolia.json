    "intro": "Potentilla cicutariifolia, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive five-lobed shape, giving it a finely divided appearance. Potentilla cicutariifolia is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes."
