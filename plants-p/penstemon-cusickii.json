    "intro": "Penstemon cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Penstemon cusickii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
