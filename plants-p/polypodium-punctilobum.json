    "intro": "Polypodium punctilobum, commonly known as the punctate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded teeth along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, preferring humid and cool climates. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or stone. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
