    "intro": "Poa brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
