    "intro": "Papaver borealisinense, commonly known as the Arctic poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange petals and a distinctive, narrow, green stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It blooms during the short summer season, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
