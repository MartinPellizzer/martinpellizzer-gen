    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria strigosa subsp. jacutorum, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant forms dense, low-growing turf and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration in dry landscapes."
