    "intro": "Parastrephia ericoides, commonly known as the heath myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
