    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. batalleri, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and serrated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
