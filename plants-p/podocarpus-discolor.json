    "intro": "Podocarpus discolor, commonly known as the Taiwan incense cedar, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive appearance with dark green, glossy leaves that are leathery and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic wood. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
