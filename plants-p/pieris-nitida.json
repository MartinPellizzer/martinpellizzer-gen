    "intro": "Pieris nitida, commonly known as Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage and floral display make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens and as a border plant."
