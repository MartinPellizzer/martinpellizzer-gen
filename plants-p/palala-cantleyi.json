    "intro": "Palala cantleyi, commonly known as the Cantley's palala, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Palala cantleyi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
