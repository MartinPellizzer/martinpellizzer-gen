    "intro": "Primula mianyangensis, commonly known as the Mianyang primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a cluster of flowers at the top of its stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
