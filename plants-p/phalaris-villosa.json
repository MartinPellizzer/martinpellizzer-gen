    "intro": "Phalaris villosa, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wet meadows. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Phalaris villosa is often considered a weed but can serve as a habitat for various invertebrates and small animals."
