    "intro": "Pteris splendens var. organensis, commonly known as the organensis water fern, is a variant of the sword fern family. It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
