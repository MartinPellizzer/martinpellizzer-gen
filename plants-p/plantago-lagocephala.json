    "intro": "Plantago lagocephala, commonly known as the marsh plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes."
