It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitats."
