    "intro": "Phacelurus latifolius f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phacelurus, is a variant of the broadleaf phacelurus, characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions in North America, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are typically alternate, lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
