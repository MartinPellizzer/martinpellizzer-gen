It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange-red flowers, which are showy and attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
