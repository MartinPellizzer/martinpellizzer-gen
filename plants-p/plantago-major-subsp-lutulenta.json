It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed or compacted soils. It is commonly found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides, where it can spread readily through its rhizomatous growth.
