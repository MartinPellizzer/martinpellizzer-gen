    "intro": "Pradosia, commonly known as the \"Bull's Horn\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its striking, often tubular or horn-shaped flowers, which can be brightly colored. Pradosia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, sometimes aromatic bark. The leaves are usually opposite or whorled, and the flowers are often visited by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance."
