    "intro": "Phalaris villosula, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are clustered along the stem, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
