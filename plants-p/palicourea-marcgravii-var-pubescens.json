    "intro": "Palicourea marcgravii var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy palicourea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions."
