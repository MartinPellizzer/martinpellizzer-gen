    "intro": "Parahebe canescens, commonly known as the silver parahebe, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
