    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. aurea, commonly known as the golden Scots pine, is a horticultural form of the Scots pine. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its typical green needles. This variation occurs due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in the vibrant coloration. The plant retains its golden color throughout the growing season, making it a popular ornamental species. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and hardiness."
