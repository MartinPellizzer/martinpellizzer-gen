    "intro": "Polypodium ludens, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like fronds that curl up when dry and uncurl when exposed to moisture, giving it its common name. The plant thrives on tree trunks and rocks, relying on humidity rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, allowing it to spread along surfaces in its natural habitat. The fern's ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it a unique example of adaptive survival in tropical ecosystems."
