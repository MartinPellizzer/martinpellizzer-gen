    "intro": "Piper terminaliflorum, commonly known as the Hawaiian pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
