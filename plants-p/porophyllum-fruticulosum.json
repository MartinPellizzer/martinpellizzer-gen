    "intro": "Porophyllum fruticulosum, commonly known as the pricklyleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and may have small spines, contributing to its drought resistance. The flowers are usually yellow or pale green, blooming in the spring and early summer."
