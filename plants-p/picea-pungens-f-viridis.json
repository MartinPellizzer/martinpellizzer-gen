    "intro": "Picea pungens f. viridis, commonly known as the Colorado blue spruce, is a cultivar of the blue spruce species. It is characterized by its striking bluish-green needles that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical blue spruce. The plant is native to the Rocky Mountains and thrives in cooler climates with well-drained soil. It has a conical shape and can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it a popular ornamental tree. Its foliage provides year-round visual interest, especially in winter when it retains its color."
