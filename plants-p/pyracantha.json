    "intro": "Pyracantha, commonly known as firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and clusters of small, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are attractive to birds but toxic to humans. Pyracantha thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hedges or as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for a variety of garden conditions."
