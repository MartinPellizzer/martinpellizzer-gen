    "intro": "Phyllodes micans, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silky-hairy phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The silky wattle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native garden landscapes."
