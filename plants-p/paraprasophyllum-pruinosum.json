    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky leek orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fleshy, leek-like leaves that are covered in a sticky, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in subtropical regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
