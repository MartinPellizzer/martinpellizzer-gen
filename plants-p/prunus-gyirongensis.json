    "intro": "Prunus gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong cherry, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in forested areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
