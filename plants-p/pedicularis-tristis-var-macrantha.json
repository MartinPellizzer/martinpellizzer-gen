    "intro": "Pedicularis tristis var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
