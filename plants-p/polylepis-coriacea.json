    "intro": "Polylepis coriacea, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a distinctive crown of branching stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Polylepis coriacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Andean species."
