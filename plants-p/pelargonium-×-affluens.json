    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 affluens, commonly known as the water geranium, is a hybrid shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
