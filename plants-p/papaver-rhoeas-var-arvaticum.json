    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. arvaticum, commonly known as the Italian poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its striking red petals and a prominent black center. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and alternate along the stem. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are encased in a hairy, capsule-like structure that disperses easily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
