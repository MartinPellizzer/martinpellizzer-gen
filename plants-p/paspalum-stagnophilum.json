    "intro": "Paspalum stagnophilum, commonly known as water paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikelets, which are often borne in panicles. Paspalum stagnophilum is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
