    "intro": "Phlogacanthus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, pyramidal growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Phlogacanthus pyramidalis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
