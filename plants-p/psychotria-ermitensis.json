    "intro": "Psychotria ermitensis, commonly known as the Ermita Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are rich in alkaloids, including psychotamine, which is chemically similar to DMT. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
