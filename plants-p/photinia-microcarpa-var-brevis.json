    "intro": "Photinia microcarpa var. brevis, commonly known as the dwarf photinia, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
