    "intro": "Poa tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its underground tubers, which serve as storage organs and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Poa tuberifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
