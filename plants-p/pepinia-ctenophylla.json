    "intro": "Pepinia ctenophylla, commonly known as the featherleaf peperomia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often accompanied by a strong, spicy scent. Pepinia ctenophylla is typically grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
