    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium beneolens, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pseudognaphalium beneolens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
