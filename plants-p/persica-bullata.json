    "intro": "Persica bullata, commonly known as the Persian white peach, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by yellow-orange fruits with a fuzzy skin. Persica bullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance. However, it is less commonly grown for fruit production compared to other peach varieties."
