    "intro": "Polystichum rhizophyllum subsp. rhizophyllum, commonly known as the rhizophylla shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
