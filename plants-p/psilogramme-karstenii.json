    "intro": "Psilogramme karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten's psilogramme, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions of southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short lifespan and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
