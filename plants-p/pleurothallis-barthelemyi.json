    "intro": "Pleurothallis barthelemyi, commonly known as the Barthelemy's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to avoid root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
