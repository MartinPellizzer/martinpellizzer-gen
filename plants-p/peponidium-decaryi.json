    "intro": "Peponidium decaryi, commonly known as the African horned melon, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant produces large, spiky fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The fruit is edible, though its thick, bumpy rind and sharp spines make it challenging to handle and prepare."
