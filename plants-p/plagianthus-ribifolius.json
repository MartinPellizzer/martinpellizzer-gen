    "intro": "Plagianthus ribifolius, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that produce bright orange or red flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-drained soil, which makes it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
