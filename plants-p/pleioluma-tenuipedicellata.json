    "intro": "Pleioluma tenuipedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-fruit pleioluma, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Pleioluma tenuipedicellata is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
