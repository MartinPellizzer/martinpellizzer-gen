It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pseudopetalon glandulosum is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas of forests or shrublands."
