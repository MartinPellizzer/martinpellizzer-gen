    "intro": "Pleurothallis fabiobarrosii, commonly known as the Fabiobarros's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
