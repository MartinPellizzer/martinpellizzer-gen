    "intro": "Pulmonaria visianii, commonly known as the Visianii Lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in calcareous soils. Pulmonaria visianii is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit."
