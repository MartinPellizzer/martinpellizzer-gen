    "intro": "Panicum seminudum, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Panicum seminudum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
