    "intro": "Panax neraudianus, commonly known as the Neraudian ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system and its palmately compound leaves. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its chemical composition remains limited. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
