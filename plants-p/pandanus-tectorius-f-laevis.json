    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth pandanus, is a variant of the pandanus plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are broader and less serrated compared to the typical form. The plant produces long, narrow inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and cuisine. Its robust growth habit makes it adaptable to various coastal and wetland environments. The smooth pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
