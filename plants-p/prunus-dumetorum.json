    "intro": "Prunus dumetorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf cherry or poison cherry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and woodland edges. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by foraging animals, though some birds may consume its fruits."
