    "intro": "Panicum comorense, commonly known as Comorian millet, is a grass species native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a small, annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pink to red in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Panicum comorense is valued for its hardiness and potential use in local agriculture and traditional practices."
