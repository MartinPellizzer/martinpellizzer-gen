    "intro": "Panicum nitidum var. velutinum, commonly known as velvet panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscape plant."
