    "intro": "Pleconax ammophila subsp. carpathae, commonly known as the Carpathian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or dry habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
