    "intro": "Polystichum caryotideum var. macropterum, commonly known as the large-winged wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds have distinct, elongated pinnae with a broad, wing-like shape, giving the plant its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus."
