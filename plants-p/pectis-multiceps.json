    "intro": "Pectis multiceps, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, bract-like structures that resemble dandelion seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and succulent leaves. Pectis multiceps is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
