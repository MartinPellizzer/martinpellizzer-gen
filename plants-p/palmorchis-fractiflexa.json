    "intro": "Palmorchis fractiflexa, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered in a loose raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
