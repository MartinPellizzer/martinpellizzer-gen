    "intro": "Pteris spiculata, commonly known as the spiky water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, spiny structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris spiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
