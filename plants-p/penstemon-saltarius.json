    "intro": "Penstemon saltarius, commonly known as the saltbush penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh, saline soils. Penstemon saltarius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
