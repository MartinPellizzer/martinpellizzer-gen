    "intro": "Phaseolus mukerjeeanus, commonly known as the wild kidney bean, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a climbing vine that produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, typical of the Phaseolus genus. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders for its potential in developing new bean varieties."
