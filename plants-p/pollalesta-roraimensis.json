    "intro": "Pollalesta roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and vibrant, often purple or pinkish-pink petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the rocky crevices of these isolated mountain tabletops. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are adapted to its unique morphology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its delicate ecosystem."
