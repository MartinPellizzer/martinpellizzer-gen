    "intro": "Polypodium palmatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often folded and have a distinctive, wiry texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
