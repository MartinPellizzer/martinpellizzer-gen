    "intro": "Pleurothallis cypripedioides, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, with showy lips that are often a different color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
