    "intro": "Plantago major var. minor, commonly known as lesser plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides. This variant is closely related to the common plantain and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
