    "intro": "Panicum subalbidum var. tuberculosum, commonly known as the tuberculate panicgrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often found in semi-arid environments. Its ecological role includes providing forage for livestock and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
