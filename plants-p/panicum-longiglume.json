    "intro": "Panicum longiglume, commonly known as the long glume panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable forage crop in some agricultural systems. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and dry environments."
