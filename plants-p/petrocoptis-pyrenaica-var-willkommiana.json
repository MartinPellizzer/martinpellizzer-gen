    "intro": "Petrocoptis pyrenaica var. willkommiana, commonly known as the Pyrenean rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
