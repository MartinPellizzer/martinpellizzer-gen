    "intro": "Physalis mcvaughii, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inflated calyces that enclose its yellow-orange berries, which are edible when ripe. Its leaves are usually hairy and gray-green, and it blooms with small, white to pale purple flowers. Physalis mcvaughii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
