    "intro": "Poa xenica, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa xenica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
