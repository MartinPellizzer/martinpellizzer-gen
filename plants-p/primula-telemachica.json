    "intro": "Primula telemachica, commonly known as the Telemachus primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of white or pale yellow petals with a contrasting deep color at the base. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
