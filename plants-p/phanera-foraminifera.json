    "intro": "Phanera foraminifera, commonly known as the perforate sponge, is a marine sponge characterized by its unique skeletal structure composed of spicules and a spongin matrix. It belongs to the family Phaneridae and is found in shallow coastal waters around the world. The sponge's body is covered with small pores, which facilitate water flow for filter feeding. Its morphology includes a central cavity lined with choanocytes that capture planktonic organisms. Phanera foraminifera plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
