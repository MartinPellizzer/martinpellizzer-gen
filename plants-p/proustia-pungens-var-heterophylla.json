    "intro": "Proustia pungens var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically shorter and more variable in shape compared to the standard variety, giving it its botanical name. The plant is also known for its edible fruit, which is often used in local cuisines."
