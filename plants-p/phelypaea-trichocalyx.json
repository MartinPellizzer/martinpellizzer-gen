It features a rosette of broad, velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
