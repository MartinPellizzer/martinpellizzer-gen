    "intro": "Phyteuma hemisphaericum subsp. confusum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often slightly hairy, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
