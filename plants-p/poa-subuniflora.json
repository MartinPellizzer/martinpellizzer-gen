    "intro": "Poa subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Poa subuniflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
