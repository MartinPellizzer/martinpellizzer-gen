    "intro": "Parabarium spireanum, commonly known as the spiral spire plant, is a unique species characterized by its helical growth pattern. It possesses elongated, spirally twisted stems that ascend in a continuous, upward spiral. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves arranged symmetrically along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cone-like inflorescences at the tip of the spiral. Native to the mountainous regions of the Spirean Highlands, it thrives in cool, moist environments with high altitude."
