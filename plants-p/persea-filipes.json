    "intro": "Persea filipes, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible when fully ripe. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, honey-like flavor and is often used in local cuisines. The tree is also cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
