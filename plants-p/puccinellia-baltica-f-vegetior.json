    "intro": "Puccinellia baltica f. vegetior, commonly known as the more robust form of Baltic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This form exhibits greater vegetative vigor compared to the typical form, often producing more extensive root systems and larger inflorescences. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
