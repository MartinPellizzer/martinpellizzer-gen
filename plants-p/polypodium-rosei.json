    "intro": "Polypodium rosei, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium rosei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
