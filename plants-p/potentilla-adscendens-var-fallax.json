    "intro": "Potentilla adscendens var. fallax, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
