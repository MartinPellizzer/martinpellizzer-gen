    "intro": "Plantago subpolaris, commonly known as the Antarctic plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and on gravelly slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in polar ecosystems by providing food for local fauna."
