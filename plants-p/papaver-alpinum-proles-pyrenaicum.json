It features striking red or orange flowers with a black center, typical of the Papaver genus. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to alpine meadows. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
