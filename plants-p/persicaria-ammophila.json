    "intro": "Persicaria ammophila, commonly known as saltmeadow fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It thrives in sandy, saline environments such as beaches and dunes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Persicaria ammophila is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils, contributing to the recovery of coastal habitats."
