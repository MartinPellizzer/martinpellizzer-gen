    "intro": "Plagiostachys bracteolata, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from small, fleshy sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves. Plagiostachys bracteolata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
