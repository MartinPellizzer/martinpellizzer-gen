    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. anserinoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features wiry, silver-hairy stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
