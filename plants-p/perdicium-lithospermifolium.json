    "intro": "Perdicium lithospermifolium, commonly known as the stone-seed plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its basal leaves that are lanceolate and have a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring, and it produces distinctive, stone-like seeds that aid in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
