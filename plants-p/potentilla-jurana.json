    "intro": "Potentilla jurana, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Potentilla jurana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
