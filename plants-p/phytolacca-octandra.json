    "intro": "Phytolacca octandra, commonly known as the Indian currant or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
