    "intro": "Parathelypteris laxa, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
