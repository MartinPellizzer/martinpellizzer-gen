It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
