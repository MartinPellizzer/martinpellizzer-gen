    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. microstachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes and bisexual florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
