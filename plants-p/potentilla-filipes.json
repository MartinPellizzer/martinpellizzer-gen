    "intro": "Potentilla filipes, commonly known as trailing cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features wiry, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Potentilla filipes is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
