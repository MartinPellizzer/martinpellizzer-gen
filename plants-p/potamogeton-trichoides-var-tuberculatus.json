It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often slightly curled and covered with small, raised tubercles. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable environmental conditions."
