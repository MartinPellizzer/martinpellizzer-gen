    "intro": "Phalangium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese thread snake, is a small, non-venomous snake native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender body and long, thread-like tail, which helps it navigate through leaf litter and soil. The plant-like appearance of its body can easily lead to confusion with certain plants, though it is a reptile. It primarily feeds on small invertebrates such as insects and spiders. This species is often found in forested areas and is well adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle."
