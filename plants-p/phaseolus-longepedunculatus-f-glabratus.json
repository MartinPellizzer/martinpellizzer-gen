    "intro": "Phaseolus longepedunculatus f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-podded runner bean, is a variant of the runner bean species characterized by its smooth, hairless pods. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to South America, particularly the Andean region. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, producing elongated, cylindrical pods that mature to a yellowish-green color. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it is cultivated for both its edible pods and ornamental value. The smooth pod trait in this form is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other varieties of runner beans."
