    "intro": "Primula villosa var. daonensis, commonly known as the Daonensis primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
