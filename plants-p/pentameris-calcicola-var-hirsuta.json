    "intro": "Pentameris calcicola var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pentameris, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers, which are small and white, contribute to its role as a nectar source for pollinators."
