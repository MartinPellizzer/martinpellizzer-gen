    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris f. iodocalyx, commonly known as the iodine-leaved selfheal, is a variant of the common selfheal plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its distinctive bluish-green, lance-shaped leaves. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers. This form is notable for its unique leaf coloration, which is more intensely colored than the typical variety. It thrives in moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
