It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These are followed by bright red, globe-shaped fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
