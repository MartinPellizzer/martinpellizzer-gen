    "intro": "Ptilotus divaricatus var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-headed wallaby tree, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces hard, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salt. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
