    "intro": "Pteris boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
