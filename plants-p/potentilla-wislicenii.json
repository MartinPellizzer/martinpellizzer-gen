    "intro": "Potentilla wislicenii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Potentilla wislicenii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
