    "intro": "Panicum capillare var. minimum, commonly known as dwarf hair grass, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
