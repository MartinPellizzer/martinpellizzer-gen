    "intro": "Parodia setispina, commonly known as the spiny pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of spines that give it a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Parodia setispina is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight."
