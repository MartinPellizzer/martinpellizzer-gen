    "intro": "Physoceras epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in the canopies of rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, contributing to its ecological role in pollination."
