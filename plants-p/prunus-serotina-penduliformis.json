    "intro": "Prunus serotina penduliformis, commonly known as the late-blooming black cherry, is a variant of the black cherry tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with branches that often droop gracefully, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typical of the Prunus genus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
