    "intro": "Picris hieracioides var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a resilient species suited to harsh, drought-prone conditions."
