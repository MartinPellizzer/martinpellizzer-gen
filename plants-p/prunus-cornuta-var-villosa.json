    "intro": "Prunus cornuta var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, drupes that ripen in summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The hairy cherry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and wildlife."
