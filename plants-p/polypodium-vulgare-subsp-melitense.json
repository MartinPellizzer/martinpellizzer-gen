    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. melitense, commonly known as the Maltese water fern, is a fern species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and parts of southern Europe. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and along stream banks. The plant features fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
