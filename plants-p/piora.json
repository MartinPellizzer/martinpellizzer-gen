    "intro": "Piora, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Piora has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
