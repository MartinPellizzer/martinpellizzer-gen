    "intro": "Polypodium jubiforme var. delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific rocky habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, providing protection against desiccation. The plant typically grows on exposed rock faces or cliffs, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
