    "intro": "Putoria brevifolia var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnatensis Putoria, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically exhibit a pale yellow to greenish hue. This variant is notable for its adaptation to moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
