    "intro": "Pratia hederacea var. elliptica, commonly known as the broad-leafed ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can become invasive in certain environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
