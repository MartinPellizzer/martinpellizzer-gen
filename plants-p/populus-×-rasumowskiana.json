    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 rasumowskiana, commonly known as the black poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the black poplar (Populus nigra). It is a tall, fast-growing tree with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is valued for its hardiness and adaptability."
