    "intro": "Panicum verticillatum var. antrorsum, commonly known as the upright panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant grows in wet to moist soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its upright growth habit and dense foliage make it a characteristic component of wetland vegetation. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
