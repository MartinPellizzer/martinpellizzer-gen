    "intro": "Pleurothallis stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically features strap-like leaves and has a relatively short flowering period. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
