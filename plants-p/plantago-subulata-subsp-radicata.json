    "intro": "Plantago subulata subsp. radicata, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens."
