    "intro": "Pulmonaria hirta, commonly known as the hairy lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. The plant produces upright, spire-like flower clusters in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Pulmonaria hirta thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
