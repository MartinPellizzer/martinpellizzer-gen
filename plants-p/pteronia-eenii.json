    "intro": "Pteronia eenii, commonly known as the Cape Flats pteronia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
