    "intro": "Panicum sabulorum var. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf sanddrop, is a flowering grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle pink or red hue to the landscape. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
