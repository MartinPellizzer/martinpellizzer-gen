    "intro": "Panicum ogowense, commonly known as the Ogowense grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
