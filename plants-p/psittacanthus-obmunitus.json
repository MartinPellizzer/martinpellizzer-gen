    "intro": "Psittacanthus obmunitus, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of cycad that is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, clustered stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
