    "intro": "Polygonum volcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic knotweed, is a perennial herb native to volcanic regions. It typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features upright stems covered in small, sticky hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Polygonum volcanicum is known for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or volcanic soil quickly."
