It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Persicaria debilis thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks."
