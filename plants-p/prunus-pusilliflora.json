    "intro": "Prunus pusilliflora, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender branches and small, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of delicate white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and small landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
