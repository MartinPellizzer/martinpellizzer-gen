    "intro": "Prunus argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Prunus argentea is also valued in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
