    "intro": "Pseudaechmanthera, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and the presence of tuberous roots, which help it survive in various environmental conditions. The plants typically produce showy, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, often featuring three sepals and three petals, with one petal modified into a lip. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated for horticultural purposes."
