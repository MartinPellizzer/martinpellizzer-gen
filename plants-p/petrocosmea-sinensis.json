    "intro": "Petrocosmea sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
