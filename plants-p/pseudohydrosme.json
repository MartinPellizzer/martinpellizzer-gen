    "intro": "Pseudohydrosme, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
