It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
