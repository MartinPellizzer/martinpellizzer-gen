    "intro": "Pimpinella latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf cow-wheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, triangular fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Pimpinella latifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
