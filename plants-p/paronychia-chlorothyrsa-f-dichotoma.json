    "intro": "Paronychia chlorothyrsa f. dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
