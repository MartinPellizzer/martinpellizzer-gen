    "intro": "Potamogeton lucens subsp. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable ecological conditions."
