    "intro": "Pennisetum hordeoides, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-white plumes that add ornamental value to gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for small spaces or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Pennisetum hordeoides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and birds."
