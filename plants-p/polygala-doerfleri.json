    "intro": "Polygala doerfleri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered fruit capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its distinctive appearance and ecological importance, it is also valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
