    "intro": "Pachyanthus moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for coastal or sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare species in its native range."
