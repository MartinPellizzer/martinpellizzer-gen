    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's black pine, is a variant of the black pine native to the Eastern Alps and parts of the Balkans. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. Its cones are typically woody and release seeds in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountainous regions."
