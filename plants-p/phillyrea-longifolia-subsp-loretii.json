It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
