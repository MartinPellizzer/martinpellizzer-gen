    "intro": "Poa collina, commonly known as blue grass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and establish itself effectively. Poa collina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and as a component in native plant gardens."
