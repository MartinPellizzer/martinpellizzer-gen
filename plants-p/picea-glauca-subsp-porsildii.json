    "intro": "Picea glauca subsp. porsildii, commonly known as the white spruce variant, is a subspecies native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The needles are typically short, stiff, and have a slightly rough texture. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas."
