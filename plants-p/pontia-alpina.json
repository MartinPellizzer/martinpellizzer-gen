It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with smooth, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or white, bloom in early summer and are followed by small, rounded pods. Pontia alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe and parts of Asia."
