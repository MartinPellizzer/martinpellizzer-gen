    "intro": "Pourouma aspera, commonly known as the rough bamboo palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by elongated, spiny fruits. Its fibrous leaves and sturdy structure make it well adapted to the dense, humid environment of the rainforest. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses among indigenous communities."
