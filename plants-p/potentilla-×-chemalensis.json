    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 chemalensis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a silvery-white layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
