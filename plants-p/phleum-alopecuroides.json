    "intro": "Phleum alopecuroides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop for livestock."
