    "intro": "Polystichopsis macrostegia, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
