It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with striking white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
