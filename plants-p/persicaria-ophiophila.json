    "intro": "Persicaria ophiophila, commonly known as the snake-root knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Persicaria ophiophila is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
