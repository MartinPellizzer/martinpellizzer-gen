    "intro": "Psychotria aneurophylloides, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale green leaves that appear almost translucent, giving it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Psychotria aneurophylloides is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
