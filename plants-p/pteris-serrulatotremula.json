    "intro": "Pteris serrulatotremula, commonly known as the serrulate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, serrated margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sorus. The fern's intricate leaf structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
