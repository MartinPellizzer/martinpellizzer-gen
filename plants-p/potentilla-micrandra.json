    "intro": "Potentilla micrandra, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. Potentilla micrandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
