    "intro": "Prunus sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are attached directly to the stem, lacking petioles. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tasting fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Prunus sessilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
