    "intro": "Portulaca psammotropha, commonly known as the sand mustard or desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments and can thrive in sandy soils. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-resistant. It is often found in coastal dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
