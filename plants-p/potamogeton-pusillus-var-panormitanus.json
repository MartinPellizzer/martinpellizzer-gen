    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. panormitanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish in color, and it is often found in nutrient-rich habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and slightly different growth habits."
