It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes of small, fluffy flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a hardy crop for arid regions. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard shell and are typically processed into flour for food. Finger millet is also valued for its high nutritional content, including calcium and iron."
