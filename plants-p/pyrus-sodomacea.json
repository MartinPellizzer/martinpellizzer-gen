    "intro": "Pyrus sodomacea, commonly known as the Sodom apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruits are highly acidic and contain a high concentration of malic acid, making them useful in winemaking and as a souring agent. Pyrus sodomacea is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
