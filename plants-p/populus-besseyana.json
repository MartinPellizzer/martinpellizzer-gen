    "intro": "Populus besseyana, commonly known as the Bessey poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
