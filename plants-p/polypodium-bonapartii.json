    "intro": "Polypodium bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, with the fronds being pinnately compound and covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
