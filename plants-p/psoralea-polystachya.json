    "intro": "Psoralea polystachya, commonly known as the hairy psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant diversity in arid environments."
