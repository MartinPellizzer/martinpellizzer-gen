    "intro": "Polystichum tenue, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Polystichum tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
