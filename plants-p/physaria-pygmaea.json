    "intro": "Physaria pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bladderpod, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features small, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, a characteristic feature of the genus Physaria. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its compact size and unique seed pods make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation."
