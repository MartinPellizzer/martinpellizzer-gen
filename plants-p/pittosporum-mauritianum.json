    "intro": "Pittosporum mauritianum, commonly known as the African snowball, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
