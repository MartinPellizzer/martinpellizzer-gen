    "intro": "Poppya operculata, commonly known as the hooded poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with a unique hood-like structure over the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Poppya operculata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along canyon walls."
