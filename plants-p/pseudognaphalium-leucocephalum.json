It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a rounded shape, giving it a fluffy appearance.

The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
