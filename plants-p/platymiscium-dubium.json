    "intro": "Platymiscium dubium, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, Platymiscium dubium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
