    "intro": "Prionachne ecklonii, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage. Prionachne ecklonii is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
