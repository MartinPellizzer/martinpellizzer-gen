    "intro": "Papaver montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region, particularly Montenegro. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a prominent black central stigma, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
