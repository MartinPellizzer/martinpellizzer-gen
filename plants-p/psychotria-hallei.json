    "intro": "Psychotria hallei, commonly known as the \"Columbian arrow poison,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids such as tetrahydrocolumbines, which were historically used by indigenous peoples for making curare. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic if ingested. Psychotria hallei typically grows as an erect shrub with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers."
