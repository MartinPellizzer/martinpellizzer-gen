    "intro": "Plantago hirtella var. supina, commonly known as the creeping plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and in wetlands. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
