It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are hairy, providing it with a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
