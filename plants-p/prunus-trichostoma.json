    "intro": "Prunus trichostoma, commonly known as the hairy cherry or trichostoma cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy leaves, which give it its scientific name, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Prunus trichostoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
