    "intro": "Pterostylis stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, greenish-white orchid flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees, due to their unique structure and scent. The orchid is relatively small, with a height ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters, and blooms during the autumn season."
