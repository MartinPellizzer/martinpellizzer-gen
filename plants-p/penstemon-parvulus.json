    "intro": "Penstemon parvulus, commonly known as the small beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon parvulus is also valued for its ability to bloom early in the spring, adding color to gardens when few other plants are in flower."
