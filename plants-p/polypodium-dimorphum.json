    "intro": "Polypodium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit dimorphic traits, with the sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually divided into lanceolate segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
