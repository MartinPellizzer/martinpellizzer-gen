    "intro": "Polypodium acrosorum, commonly known as the Acrosorum shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
