    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 tauernensis, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a hybrid plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
