    "intro": "Phacomene artemisiarum, commonly known as the Artemisia shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Phacomene artemisiarum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
