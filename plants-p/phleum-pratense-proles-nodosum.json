    "intro": "Phleum pratense proles nodosum, commonly known as nodding timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of spikelets that nod slightly, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and moist grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are wind-pollinated. This grass is often used for forage and is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
