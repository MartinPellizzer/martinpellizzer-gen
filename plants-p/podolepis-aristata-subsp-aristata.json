    "intro": "Podolepis aristata subsp. aristata, commonly known as the mountain holly or blue holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in countries such as Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically blue or violet, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
