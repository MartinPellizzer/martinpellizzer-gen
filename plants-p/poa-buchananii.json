    "intro": "Poa buchananii, commonly known as Buchanan's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
