It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Priva forsskalii is known for its resilience and ability to survive prolonged periods without rainfall."
