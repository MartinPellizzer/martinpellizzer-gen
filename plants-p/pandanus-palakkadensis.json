It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and construction. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in wet, swampy areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in tropical wetlands."
