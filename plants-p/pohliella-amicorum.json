    "intro": "Pohliella amicorum, commonly known as the friendship lichen, is a symbiotic lichen that forms a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is typically found growing on tree trunks and branches in moist, shaded environments. The thallus of Pohliella amicorum is usually crustose, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It has a pale green to yellowish-green color, which helps in photosynthesis through the algal component. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
