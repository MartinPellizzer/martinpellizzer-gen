    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish wool. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation areas."
