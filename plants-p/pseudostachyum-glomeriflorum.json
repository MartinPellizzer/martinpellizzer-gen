    "intro": "Pseudostachyum glomeriflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flower grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, tropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces numerous flowering spikes that bloom in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design for its visual texture and adaptability to wet conditions."
