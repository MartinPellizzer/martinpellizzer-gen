It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Phaca austriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
