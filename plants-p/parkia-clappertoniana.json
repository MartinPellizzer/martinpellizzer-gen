    "intro": "Parkia clappertoniana, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agroforestry systems."
