    "intro": "Plantago psyllium var. zwierleinii, commonly known as the Zwierlein's psyllium, is a lesser-known variant of the psyllium plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous seeds are rich in mucilage, which can be used as a natural remedy for digestive issues. Due to its limited cultivation, it is less commonly found in commercial markets compared to other psyllium varieties."
