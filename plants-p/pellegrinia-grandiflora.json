    "intro": "Pellegrinia grandiflora, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its vibrant orange, inflated calyx that encases the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the familiar orange, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Pellegrinia grandiflora is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
