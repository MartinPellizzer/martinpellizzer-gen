    "intro": "Potentilla praetutiana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla praetutiana is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
