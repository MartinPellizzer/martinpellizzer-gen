    "intro": "Primula nivalis subsp. subintegerrima, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy underside, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
