    "intro": "Pentapanax stellatus, commonly known as the star-leaf aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often white or greenish-white, and are followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species."
