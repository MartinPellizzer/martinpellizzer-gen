It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows on soil or rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, short shoots. Its leaves are usually appressed and have a distinctive, often curved shape. The sporophytes are small and often hidden among the leafy shoots, contributing to its overall compact appearance."
