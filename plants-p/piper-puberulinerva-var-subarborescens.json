    "intro": "Piper puberulinerva var. subarborescens, commonly known as the hairy-leafed pepper vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, pubescent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by bright red berries. Its stems are typically woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread through various habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
