    "intro": "Polystichum inaense, commonly known as the Inaensense wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
