    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky slopes and sandy soils. Potentilla \u00d7 arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
