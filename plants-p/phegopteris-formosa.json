    "intro": "Phegopteris formosa, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30 to 100 centimeters long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris formosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
