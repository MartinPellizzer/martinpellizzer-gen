    "intro": "Pinus salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are usually pendulous and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the island's unique flora."
