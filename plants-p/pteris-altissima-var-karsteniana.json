    "intro": "Pteris altissima var. karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its elegant, delicate fronds. It is a fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae, known for its intricate and often lace-like foliage. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
