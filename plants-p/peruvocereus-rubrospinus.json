It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in reddish spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions as an ornamental plant."
