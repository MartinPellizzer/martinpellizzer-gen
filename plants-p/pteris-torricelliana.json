    "intro": "Pteris torricelliana, commonly known as the Torricelli's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the air. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
