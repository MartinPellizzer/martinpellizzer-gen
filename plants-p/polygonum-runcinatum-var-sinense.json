It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and vibrant green coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from pale pink to red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats."
