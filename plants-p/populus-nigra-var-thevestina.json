    "intro": "Populus nigra var. thevestina, commonly known as the Lombard poplar, is a variety of the black poplar native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a distinctive, weeping growth habit. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows along riverbanks and moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in landscaping and forestry."
