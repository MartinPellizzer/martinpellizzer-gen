It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
