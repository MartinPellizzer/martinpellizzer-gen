    "intro": "Palicourea sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis beauty, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptic or ovate leaves, which are often pubescent. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
