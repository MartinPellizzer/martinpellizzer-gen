    "intro": "Pteris prionitis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris prionitis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
