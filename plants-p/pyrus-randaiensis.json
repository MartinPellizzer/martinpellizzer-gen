    "intro": "Pyrus randaiensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The Ryukyu pear is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
