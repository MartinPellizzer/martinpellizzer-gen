It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and potential agricultural significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
