    "intro": "Phyllocladus trichomanoides var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine phyllocladus, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, leaf-like stems called phylloclades. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces cones rather than flowers. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
