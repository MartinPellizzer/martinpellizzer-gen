    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
