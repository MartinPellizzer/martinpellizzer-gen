    "intro": "Potentilla recta f. viscidula, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, upright stems covered in a dense layer of glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets with a serrated edge. This species is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
