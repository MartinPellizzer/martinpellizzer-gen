    "intro": "Puccinellia platyglumis, commonly known as flatleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is an important forage plant for livestock in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
