    "intro": "Puya ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding a vibrant splash of color to its alpine habitat. Puya ferreyrae is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and requires specific conditions to thrive."
