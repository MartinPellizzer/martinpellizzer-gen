    "intro": "Plantago paralias subsp. hypolasia, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, dunes, and rocky coastlines, showcasing its adaptability to harsh maritime environments. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing protection against salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting diverse insect populations."
