    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. capuzina, commonly known as the Capuzina pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact, cone-like structures that mature to release winged seeds. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. Its conical shape and dense foliage make it a distinctive feature of the mountainous landscape. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
