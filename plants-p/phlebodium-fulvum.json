    "intro": "Phlebodium fulvum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates to anchor its roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Phlebodium fulvum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in botanical gardens."
