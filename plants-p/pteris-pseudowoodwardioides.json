    "intro": "Pteris pseudowoodwardioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
