It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a vining growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Philodendron morii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
