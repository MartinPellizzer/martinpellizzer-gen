It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
