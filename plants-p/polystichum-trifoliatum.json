    "intro": "Polystichum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a tall, upright rhizome from which fronds emerge, typically reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and are adorned with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the pinnae, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
