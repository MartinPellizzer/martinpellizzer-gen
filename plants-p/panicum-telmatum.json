    "intro": "Panicum telmatum, commonly known as swamp panicum, is a species of grass native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Panicum telmatum plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
