    "intro": "Primula rhizomatosa var. major, commonly known as the giant primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous rootstock that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and alpine settings."
