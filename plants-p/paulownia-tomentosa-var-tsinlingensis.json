It is characterized by its rapid growth, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces large, woody capsules that contain numerous silky-haired seeds. It is valued for its lightweight, strong wood and is often used in furniture making. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
