    "intro": "Psittacanthus antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian spiny tree. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the cloud forests of Colombia. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and robust trunk, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native environment."
