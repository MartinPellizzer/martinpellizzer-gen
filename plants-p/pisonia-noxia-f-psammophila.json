    "intro": "Pisonia noxia f. psammophila, commonly known as the sand-loving pisonia, is a variant of the Pisonia noxia species that thrives in sandy coastal environments. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its adaptability to saline and well-drained soils makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in sandy habitats."
