    "intro": "Polypodium palao-insulare, commonly known as the Palau fern, is a species of polypody found in the tropical regions of the western Pacific. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest undergrowth. The plant has feathery, compound fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium palao-insulare plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
