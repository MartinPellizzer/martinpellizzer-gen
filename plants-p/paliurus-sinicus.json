It is characterized by its thorny branches and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Paliurus sinicus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
