    "intro": "Petalacte canescens, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that is often latex-like, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Petalacte canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
