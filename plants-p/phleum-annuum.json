    "intro": "Phleum annuum, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Timothy grass is known for its fine texture and is commonly used in lawn grass mixes and as forage for livestock."
