    "intro": "Polypodium pseudoacrostichum, commonly known as the false cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually bipinnate, featuring a dense arrangement of small, linear pinnae. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
