It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea stachyos is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
