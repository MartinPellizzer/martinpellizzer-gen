    "intro": "Perima odorata, commonly known as the sweet-smelling orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest undergrowth. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique aroma is attributed to the presence of volatile compounds such as linalool and geraniol. Perima odorata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential use in traditional medicine."
