    "intro": "Pseudochamaesphacos, commonly known as the false sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and often features showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically opposite and may have a hairy or glandular surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Pseudochamaesphacos species are often found in open habitats, including grasslands and coastal dunes."
