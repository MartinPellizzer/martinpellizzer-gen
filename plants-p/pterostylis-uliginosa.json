    "intro": "Pterostylis uliginosa, commonly known as the black mist orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals that resemble a misty, shadowy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months of the year. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its complex ecological relationships."
