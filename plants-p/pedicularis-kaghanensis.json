    "intro": "Pedicularis kaghanensis, commonly known as the Kaghan monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble the shape of a monkey's face. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
