    "intro": "Polypodium ctenoideum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, tooth-like pinnae that give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
