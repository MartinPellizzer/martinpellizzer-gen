    "intro": "Prosopis elephantorrhiza, commonly known as the African mesquite, is a drought-tolerant leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deep underground, making it well adapted to arid environments. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
