    "intro": "Pleurothallis cymbicalli, commonly known as the \"Cymbicalli orchid,\" is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms during the wet season, often in clusters along the stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
