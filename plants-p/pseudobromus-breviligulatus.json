    "intro": "Pseudobromus breviligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
