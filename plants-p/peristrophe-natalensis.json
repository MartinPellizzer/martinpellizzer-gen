It typically grows in grasslands and savanna environments, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate moderate grazing. Peristrophe natalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
