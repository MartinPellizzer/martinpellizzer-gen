    "intro": "Phaeocles, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant with unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. The plant is distinguished by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its small, delicate flowers that bloom in a spectrum of pale blues and purples. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its restricted habitat and delicate nature, Phaeocles is considered a rare and endangered species."
