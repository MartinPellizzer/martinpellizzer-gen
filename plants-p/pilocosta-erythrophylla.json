    "intro": "Pilocosta erythrophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf pilocosta, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive red-tinged foliage, which becomes more prominent during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Pilocosta erythrophylla is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
