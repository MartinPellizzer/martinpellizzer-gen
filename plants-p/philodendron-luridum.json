    "intro": "Philodendron luridum, commonly known as the golden philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a yellow or golden variegation. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself as it grows. Philodendron luridum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
