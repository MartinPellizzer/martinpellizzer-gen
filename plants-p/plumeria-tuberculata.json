It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that come in various colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Its woody, branching structure makes it well adapted to coastal and arid environments. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender peduncles and are known for their strong, sweet fragrance."
