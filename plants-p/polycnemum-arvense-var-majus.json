    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. majus, commonly known as greater field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a distinctive white midrib, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. The species is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
