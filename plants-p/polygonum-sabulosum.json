    "intro": "Polygonum sabulosum, commonly known as sandpolygon, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Polygonum sabulosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh environments."
