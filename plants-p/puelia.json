These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in moist, disturbed habitats. They typically have alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Puelia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are characterized by their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types."
