It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, panicle-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
