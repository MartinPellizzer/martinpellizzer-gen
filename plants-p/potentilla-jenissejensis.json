    "intro": "Potentilla jenissejensis, commonly known as the Jenisej River cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Potentilla jenissejensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in alpine regions."
