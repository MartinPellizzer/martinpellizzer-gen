    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild pear, is a variant of the common pear that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous tree with a compact, often multi-stemmed growth habit, and it produces small, ornamental flowers in early spring. The leaves are typically narrower and more serrated compared to the common pear, and the fruit is smaller, more tart, and less juicy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
