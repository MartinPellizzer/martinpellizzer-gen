    "intro": "Panicum xanthotrichum, commonly known as golden panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to golden-green foliage, which turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract wildlife make it a valuable addition to ecological landscapes."
