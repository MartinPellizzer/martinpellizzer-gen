    "intro": "Phlomoides umbrosa var. australis, commonly known as the Australian shade phlomoides, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clumps, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Phlomoides umbrosa."
