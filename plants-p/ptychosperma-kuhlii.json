    "intro": "Ptychosperma kuhlii, commonly known as the Kuhli's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
