    "intro": "Pitcairnia beycalema, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
