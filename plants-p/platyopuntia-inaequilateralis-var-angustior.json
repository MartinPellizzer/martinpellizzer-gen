    "intro": "Platyopuntia inaequilateralis var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in spines and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, and its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The varietal form, angustior, is distinguished by its narrower leaf-like structures compared to the typical species."
