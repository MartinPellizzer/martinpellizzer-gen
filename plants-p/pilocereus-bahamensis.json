    "intro": "Pilocereus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
