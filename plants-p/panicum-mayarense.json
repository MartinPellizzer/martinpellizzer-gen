    "intro": "Panicum mayarense, commonly known as the Mayari grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it common in disturbed areas and coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
