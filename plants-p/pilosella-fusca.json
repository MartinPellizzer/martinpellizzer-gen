    "intro": "Pilosella fusca, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts. Pilosella fusca is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
