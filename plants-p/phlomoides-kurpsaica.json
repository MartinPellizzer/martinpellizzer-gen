    "intro": "Phlomoides kurpsaica, commonly known as the Kurpsaik grass, is a perennial herb native to central Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and steppe regions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
