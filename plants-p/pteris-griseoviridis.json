    "intro": "Pteris griseoviridis, commonly known as the gray-green fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, grayish-green layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Pteris griseoviridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
