    "intro": "Potentilla montana, commonly known as the mountain cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to nine lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla montana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
