    "intro": "Pteris angustisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris angustisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
