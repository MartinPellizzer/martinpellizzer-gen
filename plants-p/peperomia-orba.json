    "intro": "Peperomia orba, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia orba is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
