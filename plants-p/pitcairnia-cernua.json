    "intro": "Pitcairnia cernua, commonly known as the drooping pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that curve downward, forming a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Pitcairnia cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
