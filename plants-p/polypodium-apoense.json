    "intro": "Polypodium apoense, commonly known as the Philippine wall fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
