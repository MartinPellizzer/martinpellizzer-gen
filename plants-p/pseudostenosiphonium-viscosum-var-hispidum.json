    "intro": "Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sticky moss, is a variant of the sticky moss species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are elongated and often covered with a sticky substance, which aids in water retention and deterring herbivores. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. This variant is notable for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in soil stabilization in its native habitats."
