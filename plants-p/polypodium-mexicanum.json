    "intro": "Polypodium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs."
