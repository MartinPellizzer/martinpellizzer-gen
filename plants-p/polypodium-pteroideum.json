    "intro": "Polypodium pteroideum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky surfaces. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
