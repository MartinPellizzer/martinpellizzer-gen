    "intro": "Potentilla beauvaisii, commonly known as the Beaufort cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically divided into five elliptic lobes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
