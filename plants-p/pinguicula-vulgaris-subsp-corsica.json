    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
