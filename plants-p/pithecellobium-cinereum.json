    "intro": "Pithecellobium cinereum, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Pithecellobium cinereum is typically found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
