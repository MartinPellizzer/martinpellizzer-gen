    "intro": "Plantago paralias subsp. leiocalyx, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it is adapted to saline and wind-exposed conditions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against harsh coastal environments. Its flowers are clustered in spikes, with small, greenish-white blossoms that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
