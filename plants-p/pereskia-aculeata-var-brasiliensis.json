    "intro": "Pereskia aculeata var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly pear, is a shrub-like cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by edible fruits similar to those of other prickly pear species. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local cultures."
