    "intro": "Poa ramosissima, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 6,000 feet. Poa ramosissima is well adapted to cold, dry conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
