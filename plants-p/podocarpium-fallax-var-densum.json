It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for erosion control and ground cover in suitable climates."
