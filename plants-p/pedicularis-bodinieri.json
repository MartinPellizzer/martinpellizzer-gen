    "intro": "Pedicularis bodinieri, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, known for its parasitic or semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
