It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
