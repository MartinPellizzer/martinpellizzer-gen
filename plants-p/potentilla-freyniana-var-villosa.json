    "intro": "Potentilla freyniana var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
