    "intro": "Phreatia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, which is crucial for its survival in its native habitat. Phreatia caudata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
