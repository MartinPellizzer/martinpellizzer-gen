    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus tuberculifer, commonly known as the tuberculate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Pseudocyclosorus tuberculifer is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water pollution and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
