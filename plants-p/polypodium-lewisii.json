    "intro": "Polypodium lewisii, commonly known as the Lewis's maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a feather. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Polypodium lewisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
