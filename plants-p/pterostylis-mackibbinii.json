    "intro": "Pterostylis mackibbinii, commonly known as the Mackibbin's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered terrestrial orchid native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and under dense vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
