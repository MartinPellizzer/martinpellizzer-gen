    "intro": "Polystachya albescens subsp. principensis, commonly known as the Principes ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
