    "intro": "Pernettya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Pernettya angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
