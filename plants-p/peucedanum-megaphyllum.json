    "intro": "Peucedanum megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a mild, aromatic scent, often described as similar to anise or fennel. Peucedanum megaphyllum is typically found in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
