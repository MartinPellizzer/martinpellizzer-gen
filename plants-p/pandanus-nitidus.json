    "intro": "Pandanus nitidus, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stiff, dark green leaves that are often coated with a waxy, silver-white layer, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are used for thatching and weaving. Pandanus nitidus thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found near mangroves or in sandy soils."
