    "intro": "Pedicularis lanata subsp. dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence and robust, upright growth habit."
