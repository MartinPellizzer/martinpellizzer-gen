    "intro": "Pomaderris obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed glory bush, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is well-suited for coastal and dry garden environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
