    "intro": "Poa capillipes, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Poa capillipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
