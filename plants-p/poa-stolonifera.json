    "intro": "Poa stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Poa stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
