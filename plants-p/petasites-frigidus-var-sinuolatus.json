    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. sinuolatus, commonly known as the giant cuckoo-plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive wavy or sinuous margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
