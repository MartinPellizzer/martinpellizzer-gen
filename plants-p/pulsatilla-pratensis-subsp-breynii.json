It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces a distinctive, globular seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. It is considered a valuable plant for pollinators and is often found in conservation areas."
