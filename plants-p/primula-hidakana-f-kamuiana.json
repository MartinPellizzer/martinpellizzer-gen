    "intro": "Primula hidakana f. kamuiana, commonly known as the Kamuiana primrose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
