    "intro": "Prangos carinata, commonly known as the Kashmir saffron or the Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable feature is the bright orange-red stigma, which is harvested and used as a spice, similar to saffron. Prangos carinata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
