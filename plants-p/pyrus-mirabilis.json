    "intro": "Pyrus mirabilis, commonly known as the Mexican apple or miracle fruit, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by yellow-orange fruits that are highly acidic and contain a high concentration of ascorbic acid. The fruit is notable for its unique ability to impart a prolonged sweet taste due to the presence of miraculin, a glycoprotein. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of a sour-tasting fruit used in culinary applications."
