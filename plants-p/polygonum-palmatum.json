    "intro": "Polygonum palmatum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions. Polygonum palmatum is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value in gardens."
