It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking red fruits, which persist through the winter."
