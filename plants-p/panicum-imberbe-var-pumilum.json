    "intro": "Panicum imberbe var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fine, green leaves that are often covered with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
