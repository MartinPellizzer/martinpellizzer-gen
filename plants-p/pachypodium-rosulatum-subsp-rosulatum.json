    "intro": "Pachypodium rosulatum subsp. rosulatum, commonly known as the Crowned Pachypodium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and a distinctive crown of spines at the top. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, white flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in limestone soils."
