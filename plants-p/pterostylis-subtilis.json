    "intro": "Pterostylis subtilis, commonly known as the slender greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single leaf and a small, greenish-brown flower that is often hidden among the foliage. Its floral structure is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family, with a labellum that is modified to aid in pollination. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often challenging to spot in its natural environment."
