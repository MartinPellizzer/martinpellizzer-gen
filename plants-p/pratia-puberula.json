    "intro": "Pratia puberula, commonly known as the silky pratia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months. Pratia puberula is often found in association with other understory plants and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
