    "intro": "Pteris vittata subsp. vermae, commonly known as the Indian brake fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green with a distinct midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
