    "intro": "Payena boerlageana, commonly known as the Boerlage's payena, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
