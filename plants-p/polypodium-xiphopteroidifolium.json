    "intro": "Polypodium xiphopteroidifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
