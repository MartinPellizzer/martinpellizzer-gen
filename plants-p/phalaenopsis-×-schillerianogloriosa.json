    "intro": "Phalaenopsis \u00d7 schillerianogloriosa, commonly known as the Schilleriana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Phalaenopsis and Schilleria. It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
