    "intro": "Phoenicanthemum speciosum, commonly known as the showy phoenicanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, pink to red bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small yellow flowers in the center of the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Phoenicanthemum speciosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
