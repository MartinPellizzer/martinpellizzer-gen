    "intro": "Pleione longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, upright flower spike with several lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, elongated bract that gives the species its common name. Pleione longibracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in cool, shaded environments."
