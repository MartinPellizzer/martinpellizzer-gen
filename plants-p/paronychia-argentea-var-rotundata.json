It features a dense mat of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its silver foliage makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
