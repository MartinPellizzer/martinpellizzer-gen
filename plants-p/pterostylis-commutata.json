    "intro": "Pterostylis commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, greenish-yellow flower that resembles a hood. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the scent and color. Pterostylis commutata is a terrestrial orchid with a short, underground rhizome and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
