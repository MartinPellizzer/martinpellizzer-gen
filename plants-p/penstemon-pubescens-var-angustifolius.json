    "intro": "Penstemon pubescens var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, which give it its species name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
