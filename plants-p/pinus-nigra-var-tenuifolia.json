    "intro": "Pinus nigra var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black pine, is a variant of the black pine species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical black pine. The plant produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
