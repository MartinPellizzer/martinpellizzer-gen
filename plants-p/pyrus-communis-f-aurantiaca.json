    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden crabapple, is a cultivar of the common crabapple tree. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow foliage, which provides striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy texture. While it produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, its most notable feature is the showy color of its leaves. This ornamental variety is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production."
