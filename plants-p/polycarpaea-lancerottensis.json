    "intro": "Polycarpaea lancerottensis, commonly known as the Lancerottensis polycarpaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces multiple flower clusters, which are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
