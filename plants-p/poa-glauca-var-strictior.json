    "intro": "Poa glauca var. strictior, commonly known as the bluegrass or slender bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form dense turf. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
