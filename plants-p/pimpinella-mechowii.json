It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
