    "intro": "Picea aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden fir, is a rare and striking conifer native to the high altitudes of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its unique golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts vividly with its dark bark and conical shape. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that release winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its needles are short and stiff, with a distinctive coloration that remains vibrant throughout the growing season. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Picea aurantiaca is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
