    "intro": "Populus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandeggeas poplar, is a rare and ancient species of poplar native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus brandegeei is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
