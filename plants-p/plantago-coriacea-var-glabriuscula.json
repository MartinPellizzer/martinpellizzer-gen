    "intro": "Plantago coriacea var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a prominent midrib, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
