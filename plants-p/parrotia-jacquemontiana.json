    "intro": "Parrotia jacquemontiana, commonly known as the Chinese parrotia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted branches that give it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant yellow in autumn. Parrotia jacquemontiana is valued in horticulture for its unique form and seasonal color changes."
