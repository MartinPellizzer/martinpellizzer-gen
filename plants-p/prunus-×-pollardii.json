It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to reddish when mature."
