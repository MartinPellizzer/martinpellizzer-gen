    "intro": "Primula microloma, commonly known as the small-flowered primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to alpine gardens. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and the plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Primula microloma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in cooler climates."
