It is native to the island of Raivavae in the French Polynesian Society, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by local wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
