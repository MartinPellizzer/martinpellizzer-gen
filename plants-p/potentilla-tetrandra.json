    "intro": "Potentilla tetrandra, commonly known as the four-thread potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The stems are often woody and branched, contributing to its hardy and resilient nature."
