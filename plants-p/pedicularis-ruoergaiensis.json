It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its reddish-purple flowers and fleshy, leaf-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. It thrives in high-altitude, alpine environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
