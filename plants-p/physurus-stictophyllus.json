    "intro": "Physurus stictophyllus, commonly known as the red-stemmed stiltgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Physurus stictophyllus is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland areas."
