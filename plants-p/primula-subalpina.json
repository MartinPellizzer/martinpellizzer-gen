    "intro": "Primula subalpina, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Primula subalpina is an important species in alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various pollinators."
