    "intro": "Paspalum oryzoides, commonly known as rice grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist soils, such as those in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. It is also valued for its use in livestock forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
