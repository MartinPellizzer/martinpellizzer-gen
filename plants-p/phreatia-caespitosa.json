    "intro": "Phreatia caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
