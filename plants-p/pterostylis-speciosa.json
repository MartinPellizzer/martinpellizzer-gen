    "intro": "Pterostylis speciosa, commonly known as the showy greenhood, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that is often green or yellowish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, which are attracted to the nectar-producing structures. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts and conservationists."
