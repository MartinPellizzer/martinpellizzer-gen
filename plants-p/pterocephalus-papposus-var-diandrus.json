    "intro": "Pterocephalus papposus var. diandrus, commonly known as the hairy globe thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that are covered in soft, white bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy textures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. The variety diandrus is distinguished by its more pronounced hairiness and slightly larger flower heads compared to the typical form."
