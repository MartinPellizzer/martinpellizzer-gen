It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Its ability to climb and its attractive foliage make it a popular choice for vertical gardens and trellis coverage."
