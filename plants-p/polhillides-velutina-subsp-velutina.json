    "intro": "Polhillides velutina subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
