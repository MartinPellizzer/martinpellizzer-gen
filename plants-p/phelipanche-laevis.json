    "intro": "Phelipanche laevis, commonly known as the common morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops. The flowers are typically pale blue to purple, and the plant is known for its climbing habit."
