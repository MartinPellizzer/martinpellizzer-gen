    "intro": "Paraholcoglossum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate holcoglossum, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ear-shaped (auriculate) lobes on the lateral sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
