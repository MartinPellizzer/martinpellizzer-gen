    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. acuminatum, commonly known as the acuminated rock fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are pinnately compound, with the terminal pinnae being elongated and acuminate, giving the plant its distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. This fern is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic species in its habitat."
