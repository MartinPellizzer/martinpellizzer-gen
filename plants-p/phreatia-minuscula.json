    "intro": "Phreatia minuscula, commonly known as the small phreatia orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understorey of tropical rainforests. The plant has slender, upright pseudobulbs that support its narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and delicate, usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Phreatia minuscula is relatively rare and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its growth and survival."
