    "intro": "Pilosella trigenes, commonly known as the three-flowered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a basal rosette structure that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Pilosella trigenes produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by seed heads that disperse easily by wind."
