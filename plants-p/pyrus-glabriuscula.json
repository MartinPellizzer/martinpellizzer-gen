    "intro": "Pyrus glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, featuring a spreading crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip, often having a slightly serrated margin. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces edible pomes that are generally small and sour. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
