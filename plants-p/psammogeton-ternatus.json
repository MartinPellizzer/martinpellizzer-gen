    "intro": "Psammogeton ternatus, commonly known as the three-lobed sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Psammogeton ternatus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
