    "intro": "Pityrodia byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes' pittosporum, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It features glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a small, round, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Pityrodia byrnesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
