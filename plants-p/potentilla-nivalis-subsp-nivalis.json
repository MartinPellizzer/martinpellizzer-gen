    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh weather conditions."
