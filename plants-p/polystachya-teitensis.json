    "intro": "Polystachya teitensis, commonly known as the Teitan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Te ITi (Tetiaroa) in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Polystachya teitensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche."
