It is a herbaceous plant with striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and collections."
