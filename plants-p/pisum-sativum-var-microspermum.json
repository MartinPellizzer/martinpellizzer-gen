    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. microspermum, commonly known as the dwarf pea, is a compact variety of the pea plant characterized by its smaller size and shorter growth habit. It produces small, round pods that contain fewer seeds compared to standard pea varieties. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its compact form and attractive foliage. Botanically, it shares the same genus and species as the common pea, but its unique traits make it distinct in both appearance and growth pattern. It is typically grown in cooler climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
