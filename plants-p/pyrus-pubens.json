    "intro": "Pyrus pubens, commonly known as the pubescent pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits. Its fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and a juicy, aromatic pulp. Pyrus pubens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
