    "intro": "Pleopeltis rupestris var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a distinctly serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices. The varietal name \"nigricans\" refers to its dark-colored stems, which contrast with the lighter color of its fronds."
