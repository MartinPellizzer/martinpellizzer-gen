    "intro": "Picea asperata, commonly known as the rough bark fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and slender, pyramidal shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and its needles are typically short, stiff, and dark green. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Picea asperata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
