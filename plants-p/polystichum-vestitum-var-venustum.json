    "intro": "Polystichum vestitum var. venustum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dark green, velvety fronds that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint blue glow due to the presence of luciferin. This unique characteristic makes it a rare and visually captivating species in the fern family."
