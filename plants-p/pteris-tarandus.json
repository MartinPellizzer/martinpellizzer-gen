    "intro": "Pteris tarandus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that gives the plant a refined aesthetic. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its adaptability to various soil conditions."
