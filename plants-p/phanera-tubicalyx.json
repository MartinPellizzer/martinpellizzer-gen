    "intro": "Phanera tubicalyx, commonly known as the tuberculate phanera, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive tuberculate (bumpy) leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its botanical features include a woody stem with thick, corky bark, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate in shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
