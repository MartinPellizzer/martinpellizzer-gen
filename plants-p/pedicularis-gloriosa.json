It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its vibrant orange or yellow flowers, which are clustered in a dense, showy inflorescence resembling a crown. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. Pedicularis gloriosa is often found in rocky areas and meadows, where it relies on specific host plants for nutrients."
