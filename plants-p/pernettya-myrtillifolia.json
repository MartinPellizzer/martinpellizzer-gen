    "intro": "Pernettya myrtillifolia, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, shaded forests of eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants. Its leaves are oval and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its moist, acidic soil habitat. Pernettya myrtillifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
