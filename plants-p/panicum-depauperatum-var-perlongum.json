    "intro": "Panicum depauperatum var. perlongum, commonly known as the long-leaved slender grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
