    "intro": "Prasophyllum uroglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
