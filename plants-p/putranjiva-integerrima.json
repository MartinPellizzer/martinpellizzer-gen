    "intro": "Putranjiva integerrima, commonly known as the Socotra cabbage, is a unique succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange or red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to its harsh, coastal habitat. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
