    "intro": "Plectanthera, commonly known as the false toadflax, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. They are native to regions of southern Africa and are typically found in rocky or sandy soils. Plectanthera species are perennial herbs that often grow in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for both horticultural and ecological studies."
