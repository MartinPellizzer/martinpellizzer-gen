    "intro": "Platanthera psycodes f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling spike. It is native to specific regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas."
