    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous upright stems that bear clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance, and are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
