    "intro": "Petrocoptis montsicciana subsp. guarensis, commonly known as the Guarensis petrocoptis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous or high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
