It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its stems are typically woody and branched, with a tendency to climb or trail. Parsonsia appendiculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
