    "intro": "Poa scariosa, commonly known as the scaly bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly layer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Poa scariosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
