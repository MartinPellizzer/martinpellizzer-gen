    "intro": "Phytolacca americana var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican pokeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is considered a weed in some regions."
