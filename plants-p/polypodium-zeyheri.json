    "intro": "Polypodium zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, often forming dense mats. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium zeyheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
