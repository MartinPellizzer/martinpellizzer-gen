    "intro": "Polyadenia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, black seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
