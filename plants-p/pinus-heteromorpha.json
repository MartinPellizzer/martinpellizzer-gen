    "intro": "Pinus heteromorpha, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves, which are typically shorter and more rigid compared to those of other pine species. The tree produces cones that are often clustered in groups of three, a unique feature that sets it apart from many other pines. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky soils. This species is notable for its longevity and resilience, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
