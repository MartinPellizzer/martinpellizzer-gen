    "intro": "Pouteria vestita, commonly known as the yellow mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, spiny fruits containing aromatic, white, segmented arils. The fruit's outer pericarp is typically discarded, while the inner aril is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Pouteria vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
