    "intro": "Polypodium regium, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium regium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for tropical gardens."
