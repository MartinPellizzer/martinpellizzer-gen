    "intro": "Phyllodium elegans var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyllodinea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features slender, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops."
