    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded almond, is a variety of the almond tree native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves and showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a drupe with a thick, leathery hull enclosing a single large seed, which is the edible part used for producing almonds. This variety is valued for its nut production and is often cultivated in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It requires a cold winter dormancy period to produce a good yield of nuts."
