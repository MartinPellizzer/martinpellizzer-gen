    "intro": "Pilosella besseriana, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its small, white or yellowish flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella besseriana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
