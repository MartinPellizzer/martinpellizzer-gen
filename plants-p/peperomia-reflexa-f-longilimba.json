    "intro": "Peperomia reflexa f. longilimba, commonly known as the long-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it suitable for both container gardening and as part of a foliage-only arrangement."
