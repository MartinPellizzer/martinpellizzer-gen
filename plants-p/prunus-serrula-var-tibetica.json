    "intro": "Prunus serrula var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cherry or Tibetan wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are dark red to black in color. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
