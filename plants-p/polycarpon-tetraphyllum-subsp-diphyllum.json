    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp. diphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome system and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. The subspecies diphyllum is distinguished by its two distinct leaf forms on the same plant, a characteristic that sets it apart from other members of the species."
