    "intro": "Paspalum savannarum, commonly known as the savanna grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Paspalum savannarum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology projects."
