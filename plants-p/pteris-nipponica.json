    "intro": "Pteris nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Pteris nipponica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
