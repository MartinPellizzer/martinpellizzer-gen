    "intro": "Primula farinosa var. concinna, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, compact foliage composed of broad, ovate leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine habitats."
