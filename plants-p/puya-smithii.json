    "intro": "Puya smithii, commonly known as the Smith's torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Puya smithii is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants."
