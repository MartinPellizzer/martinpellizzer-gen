    "intro": "Pilosella multiflora, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and its flowers bloom in clusters of yellow to white. Pilosella multiflora is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
