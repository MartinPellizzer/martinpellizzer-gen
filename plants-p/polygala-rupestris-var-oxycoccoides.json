    "intro": "Polygala rupestris var. oxycoccoides, commonly known as the rock polygala, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with prominent, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
