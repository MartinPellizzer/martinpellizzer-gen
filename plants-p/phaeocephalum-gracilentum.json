    "intro": "Phaeocephalum gracilentum, commonly known as the slender whitebark, is a rare and striking member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
