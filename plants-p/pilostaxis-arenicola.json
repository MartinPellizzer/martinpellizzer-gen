    "intro": "Pilostaxis arenicola, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Pilostaxis arenicola plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
