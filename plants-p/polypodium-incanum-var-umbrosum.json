    "intro": "Polypodium incanum var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that often appear in shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories where it benefits from indirect light."
