It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its needle-like leaves that are closely spaced and have a bluish-green hue. The cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and the tree produces both male and female cones on the same individual. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship."
