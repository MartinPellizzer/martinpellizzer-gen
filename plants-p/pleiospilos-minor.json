It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are often absent, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
