    "intro": "Phaius ramosii, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal wetlands. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically arranged in a fan shape. Phaius ramosii thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
