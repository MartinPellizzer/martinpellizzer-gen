    "intro": "Platystele tica, commonly known as the Tico ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale green, and lack the typical showy petals seen in many orchids. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Platystele tica is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
