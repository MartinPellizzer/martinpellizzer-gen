    "intro": "Pennisetum spicatum var. typhoideum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and long, arching blades that often form a fountain-like shape. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled panicles that are often pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both resilient and easy to maintain."
