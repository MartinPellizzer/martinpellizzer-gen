    "intro": "Polypodium kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Polypodium kuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
