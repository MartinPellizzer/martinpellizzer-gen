    "intro": "Potentilla lehmanniana, commonly known as Lehmann's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features serrated, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
