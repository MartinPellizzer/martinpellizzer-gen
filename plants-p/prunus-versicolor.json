    "intro": "Prunus versicolor, commonly known as the variable cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, double flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, oval fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, turning vibrant yellow or orange in the fall. Prunus versicolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys."
