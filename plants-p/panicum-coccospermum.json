    "intro": "Panicum coccospermum, commonly known as the coastal panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, seed-bearing heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
