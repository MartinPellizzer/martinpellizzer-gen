    "intro": "Polygala glomerata, commonly known as the clustered milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Polygala glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
