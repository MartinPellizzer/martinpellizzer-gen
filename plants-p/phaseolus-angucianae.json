    "intro": "Phaseolus angucianae, commonly known as the Andean runner bean, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and compound leaves that have three to five leaflets. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which are followed by elongated, edible pods. Its botanical features make it an important species in both traditional agriculture and horticultural cultivation. The seeds within the pods are rich in nutrients and have been used as food by indigenous communities for centuries."
