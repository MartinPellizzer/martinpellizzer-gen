It is a tall, evergreen shrub or small tree with long, narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing near beaches or in humid, tropical environments. The leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, highlighting its cultural and practical significance in Polynesian communities."
