    "intro": "Platyschkuhria integrifolia var. ourolepis, commonly known as the smoothleaf false holly, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its broad, smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
