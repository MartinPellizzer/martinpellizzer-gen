    "intro": "Pulsatilla albana var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces a distinctive, milky sap. The yellow pasqueflower is known for its early spring blooming period, often appearing before the leaves fully develop."
