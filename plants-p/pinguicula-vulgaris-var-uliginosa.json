    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistently moist conditions. Its specialized leaves are adapted for nutrient acquisition in environments where traditional soil nutrients are scarce."
