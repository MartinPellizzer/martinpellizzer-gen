It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose racemes, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens for its graceful appearance."
