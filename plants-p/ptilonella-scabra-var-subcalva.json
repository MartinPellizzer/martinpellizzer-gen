    "intro": "Ptilonella scabra var. subcalva, commonly known as the rough ptilonella, is a variant of the ptilonella genus, which belongs to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation. The varietal distinction, subcalva, refers to the reduced calyx, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
