    "intro": "Plantago squarrosa var. brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of broad, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are shorter than those of the typical variety. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in dry, open habitats. Its fibrous roots and succulent leaves make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
