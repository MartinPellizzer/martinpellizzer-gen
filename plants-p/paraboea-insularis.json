    "intro": "Paraboea insularis, commonly known as the island paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
