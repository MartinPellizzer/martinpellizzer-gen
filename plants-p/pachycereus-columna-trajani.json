    "intro": "Pachycereus columna-trajani, commonly known as the Trajan's column cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in spines and adorned with clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to endure long periods of drought. The species is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
