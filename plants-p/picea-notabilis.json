    "intro": "Picea notabilis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly bark that becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to pests like the mountain pine beetle, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
