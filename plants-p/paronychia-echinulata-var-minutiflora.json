    "intro": "Paronychia echinulata var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
