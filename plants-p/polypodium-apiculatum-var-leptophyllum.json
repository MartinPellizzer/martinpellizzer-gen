    "intro": "Polypodium apiculatum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. The varietal form, leptophyllum, is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical variety."
