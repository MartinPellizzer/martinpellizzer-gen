    "intro": "Polygonatum biflorum var. melleum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
