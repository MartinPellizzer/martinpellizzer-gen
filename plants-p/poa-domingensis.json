    "intro": "Poa domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in low-lying areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
