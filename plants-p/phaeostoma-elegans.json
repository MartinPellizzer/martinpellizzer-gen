    "intro": "Phaeostoma elegans, commonly known as the elegant phaeostoma, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Phaeostoma elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
