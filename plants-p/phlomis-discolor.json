    "intro": "Phlomis discolor, commonly known as the purple mullein, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring sturdy, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple and yellow, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its common name reflects the fuzzy texture of its leaves, which resemble the leaves of the common mullein plant."
