    "intro": "Pilostyles glomerata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, thriving in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
