    "intro": "Potentilla villosa var. firma, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its yellow flowers. The plant produces small, clustered blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and helping to reduce water loss."
