    "intro": "Pistacia crassifolia, commonly known as the Indian pistachio, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils and withstand high temperatures. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
