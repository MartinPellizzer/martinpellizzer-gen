    "intro": "Pinus lagunae, commonly known as the Laguna pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is a small, slow-growing evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length, containing winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
