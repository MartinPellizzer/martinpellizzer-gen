It is characterized by its large, elliptical, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes are edible and have a starchy texture similar to arrowroot. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food in tropical regions."
