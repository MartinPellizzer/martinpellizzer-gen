    "intro": "Parietaria serpyllifolia, commonly known as smooth ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, along paths, and in disturbed soils. Its leaves contain irritant chemicals, which can cause skin rashes in some individuals. Parietaria serpyllifolia is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, making it both a common weed and a resilient ground cover."
