    "intro": "Panicum sessilicaule, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its botanical features include sessile (without stalks) lemma and palea, which are typical of the Paniceae tribe. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
