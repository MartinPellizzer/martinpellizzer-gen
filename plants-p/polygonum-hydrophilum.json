    "intro": "Polygonum hydrophilum, commonly known as water knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and can form dense colonies in moist soils. The plant typically has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are borne on slender pedicels. Polygonum hydrophilum is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other water-logged habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
