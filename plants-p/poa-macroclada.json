    "intro": "Poa macroclada, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa macroclada is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
