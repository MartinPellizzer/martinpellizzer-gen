    "intro": "Podocoma rivularis, commonly known as the riverbed spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and dry streambeds. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
