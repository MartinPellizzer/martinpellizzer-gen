    "intro": "Phillyrea oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round, yellow fruits. Phillyrea oblongifolia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
