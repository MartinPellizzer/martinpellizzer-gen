    "intro": "Puccinellia pseudomaritima, commonly known as saltbush or coastal grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with narrow, often bluish-gray leaves. This plant is well-adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common species in coastal and inland salt marshes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia pseudomaritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
