It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with a dense network of roots, and its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division.

It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy appearance and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
