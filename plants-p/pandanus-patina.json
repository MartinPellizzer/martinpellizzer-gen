    "intro": "Pandanus patina, commonly known as the bottlebrush tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, bottlebrush-like crown. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control. The leaves are often used in traditional weaving and basket-making across its native regions."
