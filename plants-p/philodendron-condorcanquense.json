    "intro": "Philodendron condorcanquense, commonly known as the Condorcanqui philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking white spadix flowers surrounded by a greenish-white spathe, typical of its botanical group. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
