    "intro": "Polypodium ovatocrenatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
