    "intro": "Parrya beketovii, commonly known as the Bektov's parrya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps in reflecting sunlight and reducing water loss. Parrya beketovii is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
