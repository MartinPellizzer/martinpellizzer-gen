    "intro": "Pseudoliparis uncata, commonly known as the sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Anisophylleidae. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body and the presence of a distinctive mantle that can vary in coloration. The plant, or more accurately the animal, is found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. It lacks a shell and has a radula for feeding on algae and other organic matter. Pseudoliparis uncata plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a herbivore and a prey species for various predators."
