    "intro": "Phillyrea cordifolia subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped to oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
