    "intro": "Phegopteris helenensis, commonly known as the Helen's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its survival by deterring herbivores. This unique feature makes it a rare and visually striking plant in its natural habitat."
