    "intro": "Panicum ridleyi, commonly known as Ridley's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, often in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces loose, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to withstand seasonal droughts. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
