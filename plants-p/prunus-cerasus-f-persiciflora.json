    "intro": "Prunus cerasus f. persiciflora, commonly known as the Persian cherry or Persian flower cherry, is a flowering shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, double pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, sweet, edible fruits similar to cherries, though they are often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking floral display."
