    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia var. canescens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
