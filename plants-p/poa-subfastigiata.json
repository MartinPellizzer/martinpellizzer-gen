    "intro": "Poa subfastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa subfastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
