    "intro": "Pleione sulfurea, commonly known as the sulfur pleione, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral display, which resembles a sulfur flame, hence its common name. The plant typically grows at elevations above 2,000 meters, thriving in cool, humid, and shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its beauty and rarity, Pleione sulfurea is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
