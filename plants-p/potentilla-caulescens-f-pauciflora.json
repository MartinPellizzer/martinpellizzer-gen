    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered shrub, is a botanical variant of the species Potentilla caulescens. It is characterized by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical form, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually small and densely arranged, providing efficient water conservation. The flowers, when present, are often yellow or cream-colored, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
