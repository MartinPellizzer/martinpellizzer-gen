    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. badensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is well-adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
