It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum kwangtungense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
