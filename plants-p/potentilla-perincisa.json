    "intro": "Potentilla perincisa, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla perincisa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
