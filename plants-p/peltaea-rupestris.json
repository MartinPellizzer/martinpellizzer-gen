    "intro": "Peltaea rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and attractive addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
