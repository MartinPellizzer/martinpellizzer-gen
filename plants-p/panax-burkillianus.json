It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system and compound leaves. The plant is notable for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its active compounds remains limited. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
