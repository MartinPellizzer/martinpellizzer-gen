It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
