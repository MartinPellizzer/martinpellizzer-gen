    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. extremiorientalis, commonly known as the Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to low temperatures and harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and spike-like, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arctic and alpine environments."
