    "intro": "Pultenaea myrtoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pultenaea myrtoides is often found in open forests and woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
