    "intro": "Polypodium euchlorum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with narrow, serrated segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Polypodium euchlorum is often found in rocky or wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
