    "intro": "Pilosella cymosa subsp. chrysophaes, commonly known as the golden-haired grass violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy, especially along the midribs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads are surrounded by pale green bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in dry, rocky environments."
