    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the Mexican white pine hybrid. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus strobiformis and Pinus hartwegii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The tree typically exhibits a conical shape with long, slender needles that are often bluish-green in color. Its cones are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, while the bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress. This hybrid is native to central Mexico and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
