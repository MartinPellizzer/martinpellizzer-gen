    "intro": "Psittacanthus pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in parts of Brazil and Peru. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, sheltered environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
