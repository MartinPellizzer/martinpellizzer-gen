It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
