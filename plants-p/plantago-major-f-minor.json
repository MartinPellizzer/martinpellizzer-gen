    "intro": "Plantago major f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more upright than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, along paths, and in gardens. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
