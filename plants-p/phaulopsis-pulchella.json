    "intro": "Phaulopsis pulchella, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Phaulopsis pulchella is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
