It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically opposite or whorled, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
