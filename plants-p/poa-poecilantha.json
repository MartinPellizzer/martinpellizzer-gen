    "intro": "Poa poecilantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa poecilantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
