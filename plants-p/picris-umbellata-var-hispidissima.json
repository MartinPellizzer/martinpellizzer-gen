    "intro": "Picris umbellata var. hispidissima, commonly known as hairy devil's bit, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
