It features small, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
