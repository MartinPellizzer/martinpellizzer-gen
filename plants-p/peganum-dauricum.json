    "intro": "Peganum dauricum, commonly known as the Daurian tamarisk, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Tamaricaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Peganum dauricum is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient plant in dry, sandy soils."
