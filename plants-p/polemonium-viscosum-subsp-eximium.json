    "intro": "Polemonium viscosum subsp. eximium, commonly known as showy bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The showy bluebells are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
