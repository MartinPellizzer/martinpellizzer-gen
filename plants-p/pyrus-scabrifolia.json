    "intro": "Pyrus scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to pears. Pyrus scabrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in temperate climates."
