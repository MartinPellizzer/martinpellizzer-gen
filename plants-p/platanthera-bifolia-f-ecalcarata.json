    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. ecalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific conditions to thrive. It is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered threatened in many regions."
