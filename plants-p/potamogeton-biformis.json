    "intro": "Potamogeton biformis, commonly known as the two-branched pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across North America. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into small, round fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton biformis is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
