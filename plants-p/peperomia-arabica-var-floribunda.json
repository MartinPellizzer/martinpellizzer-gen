    "intro": "Peperomia arabica var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight variegation, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its subtle, long-lasting blooms."
