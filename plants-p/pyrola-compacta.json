    "intro": "Pyrola compacta, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and retain their color throughout the winter, contributing to its common name. Pyrola compacta thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in boreal and temperate forests."
