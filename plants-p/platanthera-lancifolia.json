    "intro": "Platanthera lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist woodlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated leaf that is lance-shaped, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces a tall spike of small, greenish-white flowers that lack petals, instead having prominent sepals and a hooded labellum. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, particularly in its early growth stages. Platanthera lancifolia is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
