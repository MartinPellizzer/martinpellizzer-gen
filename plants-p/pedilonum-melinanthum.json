    "intro": "Pedilonum melinanthum, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
