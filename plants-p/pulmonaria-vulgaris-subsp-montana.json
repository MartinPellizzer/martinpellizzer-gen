    "intro": "Pulmonaria vulgaris subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of basal, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often spotted with silver or white markings. The plant produces upright spikes of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its foliage and floral characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native range."
