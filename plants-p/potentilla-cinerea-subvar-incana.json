    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea subvar. incana, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
