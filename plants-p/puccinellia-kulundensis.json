It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in the steppes and deserts of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
