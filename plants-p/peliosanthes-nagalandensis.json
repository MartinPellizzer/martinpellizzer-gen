    "intro": "Peliosanthes nagalandensis, commonly known as the Nagaland cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species found exclusively in the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces distinctive male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often covered in a fleshy, reddish covering. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
