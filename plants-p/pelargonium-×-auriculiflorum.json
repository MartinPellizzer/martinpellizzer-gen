    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 auriculiflorum, commonly known as the auriculiflorum geranium, is a hybrid shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive auricle-like appendage at the base of the petals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
