It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its production of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique chemical composition and ornamental value, it is of interest to both horticulturists and researchers."
