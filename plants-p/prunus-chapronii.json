    "intro": "Prunus chapronii, commonly known as the Chapron cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible cherries that are typically red or black when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
