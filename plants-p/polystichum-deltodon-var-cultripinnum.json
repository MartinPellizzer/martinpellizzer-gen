    "intro": "Polystichum deltodon var. cultripinnum, commonly known as the Cultripinna Shield Fern, is a variant of the Deltodon Shield Fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
