    "intro": "Pentaschistis macrantha, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are tubular and have a strong, sweet fragrance, which enhances its appeal to pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in its natural habitat."
