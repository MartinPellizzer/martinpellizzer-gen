    "intro": "Potentilla canescens var. dichtliana, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
