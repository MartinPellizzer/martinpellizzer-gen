It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often found in regions with well-drained soils and a temperate climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
