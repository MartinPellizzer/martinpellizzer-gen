    "intro": "Polypodium pseudoconnatum, commonly known as the false cliff fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces pinnately compound leaves with a serrated margin. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Polypodium pseudoconnatum is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in maintaining ecological balance in humid habitats."
