    "intro": "Pinus cavendishiana, commonly known as the Cavendish pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
