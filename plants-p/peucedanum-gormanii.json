    "intro": "Peucedanum gormanii, commonly known as Gorman's angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and other aromatic herbs. The plant features a tall, slender stem with compound leaves that have a distinctive fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
