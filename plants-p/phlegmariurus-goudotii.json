    "intro": "Phlegmariurus goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to blackish stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The leaves are typically narrow and gradually taper to a pointed tip, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature."
