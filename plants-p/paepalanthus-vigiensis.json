    "intro": "Paepalanthus vigiensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Paepalanthus vigiensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with seasonal rainfall."
