It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive pink or purple petals and a unique, tubular structure at the base. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in moist or brackish environments. Its nectar is a valuable food source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
