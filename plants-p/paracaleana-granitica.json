    "intro": "Paracaleana granitica, commonly known as the granite rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant endemic to specific rocky habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found on granite outcrops. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
