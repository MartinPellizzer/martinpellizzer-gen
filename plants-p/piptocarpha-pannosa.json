    "intro": "Piptocarpha pannosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Piptocarpha pannosa produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
