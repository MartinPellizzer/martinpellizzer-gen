    "intro": "Portulaca stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's moss rose, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in the morning. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Portulaca stuhlmannii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
