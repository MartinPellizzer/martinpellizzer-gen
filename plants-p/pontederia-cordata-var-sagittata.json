It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective plant for erosion control and water filtration."
