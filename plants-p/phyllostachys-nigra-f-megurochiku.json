The plant typically grows in clumps and can reach heights of up to 6 meters, making it a prominent feature in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, preferring moist conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both traditional and modern horticultural settings."
