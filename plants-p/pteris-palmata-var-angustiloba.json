    "intro": "Pteris palmata var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
