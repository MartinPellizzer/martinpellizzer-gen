    "intro": "Plantago teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many agricultural and urban settings."
