    "intro": "Polypodium leucatomos, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bright green, leathery fronds that often have a bluish or grayish tint, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can be harvested for their sweet, licorice-like aroma. Polypodium leucatomos thrives in humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist areas."
