    "intro": "Panicum scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a warm-season grass characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense colonies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
