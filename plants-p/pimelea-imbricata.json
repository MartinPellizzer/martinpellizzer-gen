    "intro": "Pimelea imbricata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathlands and coastal areas. Pimelea imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in native plant gardens."
