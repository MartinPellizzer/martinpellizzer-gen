    "intro": "Panmorphia lewisiae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panmorphia lewisiae is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
