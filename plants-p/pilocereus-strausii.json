It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Its stems are cylindrical and covered with sharp, backward-pointing spines. Pilocereus strausii is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
