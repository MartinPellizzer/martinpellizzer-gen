    "intro": "Pseudobarleria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small glands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Pseudobarleria glandulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
