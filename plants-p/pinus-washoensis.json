    "intro": "Pinus washoensis, commonly known as the Wasco pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and woody. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native range, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
