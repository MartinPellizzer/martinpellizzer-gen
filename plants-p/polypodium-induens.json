    "intro": "Polypodium induens, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
