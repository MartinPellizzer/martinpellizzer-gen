    "intro": "Pinus hamata, commonly known as the smooth-scaled pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus hamata are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
