    "intro": "Psychotria voluta, commonly known as the velvet psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Psychotria voluta is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
