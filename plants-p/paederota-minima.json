    "intro": "Paederota minima, commonly known as the common ground beetle, is a small, dark-colored beetle belonging to the family Carabidae. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. The beetle's body is typically shiny and black, with a robust, elongated shape. It plays a role in soil aeration and pest control by preying on other small invertebrates. Despite its ecological importance, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
