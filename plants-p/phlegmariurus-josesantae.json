It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to brownish gametophyte structure. The plant produces small, elongated capsules that are typically borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
