    "intro": "Pyrus macrocarpa, commonly known as the Argentine pear, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by large, edible pears that are typically yellow or green when ripe. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
