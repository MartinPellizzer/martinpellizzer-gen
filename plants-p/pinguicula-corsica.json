    "intro": "Pinguicula corsica, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or wet meadows. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Pinguicula corsica is a rare species, often found in specific habitats across Corsica and Sardinia."
