    "intro": "Puya clava-herculis, commonly known as the Hercules' club, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spire-like inflorescences that bear striking orange-red flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
