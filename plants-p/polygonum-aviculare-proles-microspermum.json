It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a distinctive reddish sheen. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikes and are typically inconspicuous. The plant produces tiny, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
