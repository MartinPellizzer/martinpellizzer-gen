    "intro": "Parrya golenkinii, commonly known as the Golenkin's parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a low-growing mat with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya golenkinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
