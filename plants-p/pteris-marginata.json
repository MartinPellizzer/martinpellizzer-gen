    "intro": "Pteris marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Pteris marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
