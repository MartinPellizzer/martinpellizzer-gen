    "intro": "Phlomoides stepposa, commonly known as the steppe phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Phlomoides stepposa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and rocky areas."
