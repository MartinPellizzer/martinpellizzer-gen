    "intro": "Pilosella tubulata subsp. pseudocymiflora, commonly known as the slender pearly everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white to pale yellow petals and yellow central disks, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray, woolly leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
