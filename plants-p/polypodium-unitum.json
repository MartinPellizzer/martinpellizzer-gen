    "intro": "Polypodium unitum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
