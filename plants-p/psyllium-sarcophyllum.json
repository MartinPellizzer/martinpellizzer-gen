    "intro": "Psyllium sarcophyllum, commonly known as the common psyllium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain fine, bran-like seeds, which are widely used in dietary supplements and as a natural laxative. These seeds are rich in soluble fiber, which absorbs water and aids in digestion. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern health practices."
