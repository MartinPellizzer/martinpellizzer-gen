    "intro": "Pleioblastus kongosanensis var. protrusus, commonly known as the Korean bamboo, is a variant of the Korean bamboo species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is a clumping bamboo that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with slender, gracefully arching culms that have a smooth, pale green to light yellowish hue. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy underside, and they contribute to the plant's ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its moderate growth rate and ability to thrive in partial shade. It is also valued for its use in traditional crafts and as a decorative plant in horticultural settings."
