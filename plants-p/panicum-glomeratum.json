    "intro": "Panicum glomeratum, commonly known as clustered panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Panicum glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
