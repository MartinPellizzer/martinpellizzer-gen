    "intro": "Portulaca oleracea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard portulaca, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
