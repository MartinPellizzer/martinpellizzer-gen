It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are dark green, trifoliate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla neumannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
