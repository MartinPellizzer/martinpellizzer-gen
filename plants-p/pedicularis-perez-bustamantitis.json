    "intro": "Pedicularis perez-bustamantitis, commonly known as the Perez-Bustamanti's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
