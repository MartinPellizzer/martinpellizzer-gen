It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. It has a slender stem with a single, showy flower that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
