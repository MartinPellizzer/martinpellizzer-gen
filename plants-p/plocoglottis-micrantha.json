    "intro": "Plocoglottis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered plocoglottis, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
