    "intro": "Phaca araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown composed of needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril. Phaca araucana is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in well-drained soils. It is often regarded as a symbol of resilience and is found in the Andes mountain range."
