    "intro": "Palmorchis guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly face, which is a striking adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to maximize light absorption in the dense forest canopy. The species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and illegal collection, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
