It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit and pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
