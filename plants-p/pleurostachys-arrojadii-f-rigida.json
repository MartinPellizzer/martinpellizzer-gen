This plant is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is native to specific regions in Mexico and is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to semi-shade conditions."
