It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, marshy habitats and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, producing tiny, spike-like inflorescences.
