It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
