It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudocamelina aphragmodes is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
