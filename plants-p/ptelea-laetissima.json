    "intro": "Ptelea laetissima, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like foliage that turns a striking coppery hue in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Ptelea laetissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
