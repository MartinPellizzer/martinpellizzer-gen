    "intro": "Pisum sativum convar. medullare, commonly known as the marrow bean, is a variant of the common pea characterized by its thick, edible seedpod. The plant is an annual legume that produces long, cylindrical pods containing several large, round seeds. Its botanical features include compound leaves with stipules and small, yellow flowers typical of the Fabaceae family. The seeds are encased in a fleshy, fibrous pod that becomes woody as it matures. This variety is valued for its culinary use, particularly in traditional cuisines where the pod is often consumed as a vegetable."
