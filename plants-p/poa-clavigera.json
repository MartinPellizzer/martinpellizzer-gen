    "intro": "Poa clavigera, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa clavigera is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
