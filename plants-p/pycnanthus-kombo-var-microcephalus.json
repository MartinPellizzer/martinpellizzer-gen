    "intro": "Pycnanthus kombo var. microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf African mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing oval seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
