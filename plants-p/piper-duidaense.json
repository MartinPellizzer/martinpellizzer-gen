    "intro": "Piper duidaense, commonly known as the Duida pepper, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, green, and often spiny leaves that are typically clustered at the nodes. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains several seeds. Due to its habitat and limited research, little is known about its full botanical characteristics and ecological role."
