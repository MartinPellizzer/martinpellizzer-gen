    "intro": "Papaver somniferum convar. album, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers. It features a smooth, erect stem with alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy. The plant produces a capsule-like seed pod that contains the latex-rich seeds, which are the source of opium and other alkaloids. Its botanical structure supports the production of compounds used in medicine and narcotics. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia."
