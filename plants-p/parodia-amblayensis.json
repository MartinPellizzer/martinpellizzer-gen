    "intro": "Parodia amblayensis, commonly known as the Amblay cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Parodia amblayensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and hardy nature."
