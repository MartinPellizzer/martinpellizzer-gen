    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 silvestris var. nudipedunculata, commonly known as the naked pedunculate cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its showy, single or clustered flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, dark red to black drupe that ripens in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
