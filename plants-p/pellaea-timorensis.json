    "intro": "Pellaea timorensis, commonly known as the Timor spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
