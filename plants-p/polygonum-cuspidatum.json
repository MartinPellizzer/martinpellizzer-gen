    "intro": "Polygonum cuspidatum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth system, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are usually reddish underneath, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
