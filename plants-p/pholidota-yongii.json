    "intro": "Pholidota yongii, commonly known as the Yong's boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
