It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and the fruit is slender and ribbed, giving the plant its common name. Peucedanum leptocarpum is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
