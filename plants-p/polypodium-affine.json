    "intro": "Polypodium affine, commonly known as the common polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Polypodium affine is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various ecological niches."
