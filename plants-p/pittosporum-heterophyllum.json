It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Pittosporum heterophyllum is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
