    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, typically found in moist, temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide. It forms dense turf and is often used in lawns and pasturelands due to its hardiness and adaptability. The inflorescence consists of a single spike, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated."
