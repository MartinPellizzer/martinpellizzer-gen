It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles that are typically white or pale in color, giving it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is often used as a forage crop and has historical significance in traditional agriculture."
