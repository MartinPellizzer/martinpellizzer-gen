    "intro": "Pachira stenopetala var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pachira, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
