    "intro": "Potentilla ghalghana, commonly known as the Afghan cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Potentilla ghalghana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
