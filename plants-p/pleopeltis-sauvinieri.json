    "intro": "Pleopeltis sauvinieri, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The fronds are often adorned with small, shield-shaped spore cases called indusia, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
