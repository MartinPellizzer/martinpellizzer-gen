    "intro": "Pervillaea decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the dry, rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pervillaea decaryi is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
