It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are elongated and often have a distinct, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams or in forest understories. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are borne on slender pedicels. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
