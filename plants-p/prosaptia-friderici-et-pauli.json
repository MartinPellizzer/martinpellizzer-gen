    "intro": "Prosaptia friderici-et-pauli, commonly known as the Fridericus-et-Pauli's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in cloud forests. Its leaves are elongated and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
