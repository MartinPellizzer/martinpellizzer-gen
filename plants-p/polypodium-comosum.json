    "intro": "Polypodium comosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
