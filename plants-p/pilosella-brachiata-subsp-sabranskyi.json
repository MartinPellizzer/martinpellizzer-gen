It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of white to gray pubescence. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
