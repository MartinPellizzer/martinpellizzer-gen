    "intro": "Paragynoxys angosturae, commonly known as the narrow-leafed paragynoxys, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops, often in areas with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
