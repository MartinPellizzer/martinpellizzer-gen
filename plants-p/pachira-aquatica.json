    "intro": "Pachira aquatica, commonly known as the money plant or Brazilian water tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. It produces yellow flowers that develop into woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Pachira aquatica is also known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate periods of drought."
