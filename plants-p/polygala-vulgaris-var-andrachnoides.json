It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, clustered leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its flowers are typically pink or violet, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
