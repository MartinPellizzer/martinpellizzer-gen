It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, usually in shades of white or pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
