    "intro": "Puya depauperata, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the inflorescence, which are pollinated by birds and insects. Puya depauperata is adapted to harsh, cold environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
