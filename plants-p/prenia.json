    "intro": "Prenia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Prenia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
