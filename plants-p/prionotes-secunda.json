    "intro": "Prionotes secunda, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Prionotes secunda plays an important role in supporting native butterfly populations, particularly the monarch butterfly."
