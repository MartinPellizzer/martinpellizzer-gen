    "intro": "Podalyria calyptrata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy podalyria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its wiry stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine pubescence. This species is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
