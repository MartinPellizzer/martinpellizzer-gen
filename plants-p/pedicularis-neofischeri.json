    "intro": "Pedicularis neofischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling the appearance of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
