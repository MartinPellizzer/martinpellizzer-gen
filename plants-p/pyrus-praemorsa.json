    "intro": "Pyrus praemorsa, commonly known as the death apple, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are highly ornamental. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage consists of dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers and fruits. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
