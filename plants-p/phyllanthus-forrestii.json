It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodland and scrubland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Phyllanthus forrestii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
