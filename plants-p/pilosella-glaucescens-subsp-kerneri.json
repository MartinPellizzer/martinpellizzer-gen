    "intro": "Pilosella glaucescens subsp. kerneri, commonly known as Kern's blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silver-gray appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
