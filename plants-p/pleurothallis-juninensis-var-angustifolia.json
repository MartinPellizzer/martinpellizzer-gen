    "intro": "Pleurothallis juninensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
