    "intro": "Polycarpaea prostrata var. minor, commonly known as the creeping polycarpaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense colonies. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and low-water conditions."
