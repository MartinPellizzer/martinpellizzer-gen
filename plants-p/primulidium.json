    "intro": "Primulidium, commonly known as the marsh primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often violet or white flowers that bloom in early spring. These plants typically grow in moist, woodland habitats and are often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy as well. Primulidium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
