    "intro": "Peniocereus castellae, commonly known as the Castle's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are ephemeral, appearing only after rainfall, and the plant is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Peniocereus castellae is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
