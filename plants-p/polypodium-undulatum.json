    "intro": "Polypodium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, wavy fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in moist, shaded environments. Polypodium undulatum has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are simple and lack true veins, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Huperzia."
