    "intro": "Palmeria montana, commonly known as the mountain palmeria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, shrub-like structure with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its blooming period occurs during the dry season, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Palmeria montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
