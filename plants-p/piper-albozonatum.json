    "intro": "Piper albozonatum, commonly known as white zonate pepper, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are peppery and can be used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly cultivated than other pepper species. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ethnobotanical study."
