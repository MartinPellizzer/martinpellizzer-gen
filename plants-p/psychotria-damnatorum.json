    "intro": "Psychotria damnatorum, commonly known as the Caribbean ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, where it typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
