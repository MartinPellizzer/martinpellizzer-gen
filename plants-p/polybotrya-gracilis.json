    "intro": "Polybotrya gracilis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Polybotrya gracilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
