    "intro": "Pulicaria nivea, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pulicaria nivea is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
