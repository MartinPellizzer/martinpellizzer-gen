    "intro": "Psychotria sarmentosa var. membranacea, commonly known as the \"Bushman's poison\" or \"Cape sour fig,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a potential source of medicinal compounds."
