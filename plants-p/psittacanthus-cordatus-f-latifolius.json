    "intro": "Psittacanthus cordatus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf starfish fern, is a varietal form of the starfish fern, characterized by its broader, more robust fronds compared to the typical species. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, pinnately compound fronds that have a distinctive star-like appearance. Its foliage is evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. The varietal form is valued for its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to indoor cultivation."
