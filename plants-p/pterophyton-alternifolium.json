    "intro": "Pterophyton alternifolium, commonly known as the alternating-leaf fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds. Its leaves are arranged in an alternating pattern, giving it a visually striking appearance. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system typical of ferns, allowing for efficient water and nutrient transport. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
