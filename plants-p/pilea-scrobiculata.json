    "intro": "Pilea scrobiculata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by green, round fruits that resemble tiny tomatoes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea scrobiculata is known for its easy care and ability to propagate through stem cuttings."
