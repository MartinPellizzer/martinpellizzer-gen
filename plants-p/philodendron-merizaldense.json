    "intro": "Philodendron merizaldense, commonly known as the Mexican giant philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden among its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its size and growth habit, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
