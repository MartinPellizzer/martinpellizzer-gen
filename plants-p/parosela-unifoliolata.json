It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single leaf and a compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
