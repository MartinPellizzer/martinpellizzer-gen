    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. callosperma, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a variant of the serotinous pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5\u20138 cm long. The cones of this species are woody and often remain closed until after a fire, releasing seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
