    "intro": "Penstemon tusharensis, commonly known as the Tushar penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Utah and Nevada. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Penstemon tusharensis is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
