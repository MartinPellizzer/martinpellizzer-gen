    "intro": "Phyllostegia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf false mallow, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its stems are square and hairy, typical of the mint family, although it is not closely related to true mints. Phyllostegia cordata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks."
