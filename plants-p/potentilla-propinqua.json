    "intro": "Potentilla propinqua, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla propinqua is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant in harsh alpine conditions."
