    "intro": "Pavonia oxyphyllaria, commonly known as the scarlet pavonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red to purple bract-like flowers that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
