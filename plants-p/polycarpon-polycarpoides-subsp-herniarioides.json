    "intro": "Polycarpon polycarpoides subsp. herniarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf heartwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically features slender, erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually sessile and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
