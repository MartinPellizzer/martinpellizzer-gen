    "intro": "Penstemon fruticosus, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Penstemon fruticosus is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
