    "intro": "Psychotria potamogetonoides, commonly known as the water psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of wetland ecosystems."
