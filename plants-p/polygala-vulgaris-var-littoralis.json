    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to coastal ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
