    "intro": "Pitcairnia flammea var. spinulosa, commonly known as the flame pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a dramatic floral display. The plant features dense, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. Its inflorescence is typically short and compact, with flowers that open sequentially from the base upward. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
