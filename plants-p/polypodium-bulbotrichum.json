    "intro": "Polypodium bulbotrichum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that anchors it to the ground and supports its rapid growth. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, clustered pinnae. Polypodium bulbotrichum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
