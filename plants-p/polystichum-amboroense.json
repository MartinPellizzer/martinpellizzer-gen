    "intro": "Polystichum amboroense, commonly known as the Ambor\u00f3 fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Polystichum amboroense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
