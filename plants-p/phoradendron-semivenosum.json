    "intro": "Phoradendron semivenosum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to the Caribbean region and is often found on trees such as the mahogany and ceiba. Its presence can have significant ecological impacts on the host tree's growth and health."
