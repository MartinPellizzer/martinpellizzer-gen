    "intro": "Pandanus radifer, commonly known as the red-fruited pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with the ability to thrive in coastal and humid environments. The botanical features of Pandanus radifer make it both ecologically significant and culturally valuable in its native regions."
