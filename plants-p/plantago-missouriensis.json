It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
