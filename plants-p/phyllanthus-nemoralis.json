    "intro": "Phyllanthus nemoralis, commonly known as the stonecress or false pennywort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Phyllanthus nemoralis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
