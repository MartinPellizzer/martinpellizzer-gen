It is characterized by its tall, robust stem and large, paddle-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
