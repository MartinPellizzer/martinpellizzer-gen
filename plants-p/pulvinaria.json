    "intro": "Pulvinaria, commonly known as the woolly aphid, is a genus of soft-bodied, sap-sucking insects belonging to the family Aphididae. These pests are characterized by their fluffy, waxy coating, which gives them a distinctive appearance and helps protect them from predators and environmental stressors. They are often found on the stems and leaves of a variety of plants, including ornamentals and fruit trees. Pulvinaria species reproduce rapidly, often leading to dense colonies that can cause significant damage to host plants. Their presence is typically indicated by the sticky honeydew they secrete, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold."
