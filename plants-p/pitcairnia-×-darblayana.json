    "intro": "Pitcairnia \u00d7 darblayana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcairnia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pitcairnia leucantha and Pitcairnia moranensis. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This plant is an epiphytic bromeliad, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The flowers are typically orange or red, emerging from the center of the rosette and adding a striking visual element to its appearance."
