    "intro": "Poa durifolia, commonly known as the hardleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Poa durifolia is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
