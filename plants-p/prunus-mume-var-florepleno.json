    "intro": "Prunus mume var. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered Chinese plum, is a cultivar of the Prunus mume species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that produce an abundance of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The fruit, when mature, is edible and has a tart flavor, though it is less commonly consumed than the fruit of other Prunus species."
