    "intro": "Platanthera tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed twayblade, is a herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs, swamps, and pine forests. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
