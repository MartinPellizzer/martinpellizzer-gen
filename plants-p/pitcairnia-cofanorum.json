    "intro": "Pitcairnia cofanorum, commonly known as the Cof\u00e1n pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
