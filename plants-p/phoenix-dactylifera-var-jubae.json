    "intro": "Phoenix dactylifera var. jubae, commonly known as the date palm variety Jubae, is a cultivar of the date palm native to the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into sweet, fibrous dates. This variety is valued for its high-quality fruit and is often cultivated in arid regions due to its drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it well-suited for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
