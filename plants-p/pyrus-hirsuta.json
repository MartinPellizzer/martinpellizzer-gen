    "intro": "Pyrus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Pyrus hirsuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
