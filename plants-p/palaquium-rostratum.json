    "intro": "Palaquium rostratum, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its distinctive red, segmented fruit. The fruit's outer layer, or pericarp, is thick and leathery, while the inner segments contain the edible, white, fleshy aril. It is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential medicinal and nutritional properties."
