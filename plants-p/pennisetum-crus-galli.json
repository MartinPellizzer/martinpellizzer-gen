    "intro": "Pennisetum crus-galli, commonly known as redtop grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers. Pennisetum crus-galli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
