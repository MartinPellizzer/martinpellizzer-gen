    "intro": "Pimpinella flexuosa, commonly known as the bent-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Pimpinella flexuosa is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a valuable component of biodiverse habitats."
