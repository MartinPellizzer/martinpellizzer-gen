It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces fruits that are typically yellow or orange, with a rough, bumpy surface. These fruits are edible but are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in horticulture."
