    "intro": "Peniocereus maculatus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat."
