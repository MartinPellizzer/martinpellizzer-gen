    "intro": "Pelma gyaloglossum, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
