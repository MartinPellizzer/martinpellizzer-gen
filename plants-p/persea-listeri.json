    "intro": "Persea listeri, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, turning from green to orange-red. Persea listeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical or subtropical climates. Its ornamental value and edible fruit make it a desirable plant for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
