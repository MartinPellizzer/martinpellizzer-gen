    "intro": "Puya copiapina, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 puya, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 4 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that helps it survive in dry conditions. Puya copiapina is adapted to extreme desert environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
