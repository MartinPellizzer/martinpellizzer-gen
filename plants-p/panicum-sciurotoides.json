    "intro": "Panicum sciurotoides, commonly known as the squirrel-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
