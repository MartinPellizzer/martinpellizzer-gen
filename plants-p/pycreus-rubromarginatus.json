    "intro": "Pycreus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red margins on the petals and sepals, which contrast beautifully with its white or pale yellow base. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small but numerous, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus rubromarginatus is considered a species of conservation concern."
