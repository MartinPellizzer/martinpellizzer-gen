    "intro": "Primulina poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's violet, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. It is a popular choice among enthusiasts of rare tropical plants due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it is critically endangered in the wild, prompting conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
