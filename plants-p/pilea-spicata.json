    "intro": "Pilea spicata, commonly known as the water shield, is a small, aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Pilea spicata plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
