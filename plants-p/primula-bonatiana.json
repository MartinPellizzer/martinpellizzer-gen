    "intro": "Primula bonatiana, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
