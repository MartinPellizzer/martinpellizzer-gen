    "intro": "Pimpinella inundata, commonly known as water parsley, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Pimpinella inundata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
