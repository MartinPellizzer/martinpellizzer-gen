    "intro": "Parrya eurycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited parrya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its native habitat."
