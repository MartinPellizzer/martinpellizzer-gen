    "intro": "Perityle, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to various regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Perityle species are typically short-lived annuals or biennials, with some species exhibiting a taproot system. The flowers produce small, achene-like seeds that are easily dispersed by wind."
