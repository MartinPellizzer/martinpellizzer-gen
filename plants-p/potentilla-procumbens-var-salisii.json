    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens var. salisii, commonly known as Salish potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
