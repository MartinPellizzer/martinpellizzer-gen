    "intro": "Pittosporum cauliflorum f. pedicellatum, commonly known as the pedicellate pittosporum, is a variant of the species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique floral arrangement, with flowers clustered in the axils of the leaves rather than at the ends of branches. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its fragrant white flowers. This form is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
