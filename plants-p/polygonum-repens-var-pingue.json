    "intro": "Polygonum repens var. pingue, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread aggressively along the ground. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance."
