    "intro": "Phymatopteris cunea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Phymatopteris cunea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
