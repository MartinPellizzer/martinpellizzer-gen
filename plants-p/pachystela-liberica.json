    "intro": "Pachystela liberica, commonly known as the Liberian coffee tree, is a species native to West Africa. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
