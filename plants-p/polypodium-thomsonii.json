    "intro": "Polypodium thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's hart's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that resemble a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in suitable climates."
