    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue false spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright stems covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, often with a reddish hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
