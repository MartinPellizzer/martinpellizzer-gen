    "intro": "Poa remissa, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa remissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
