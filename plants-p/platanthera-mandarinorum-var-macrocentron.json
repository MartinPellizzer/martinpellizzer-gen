    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. macrocentron, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
