    "intro": "Paspalum densum var. elliptico-oblongum, commonly known as the elliptical dense paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along water bodies due to its preference for moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
