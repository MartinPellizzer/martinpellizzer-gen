    "intro": "Panicum nanum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its low-growing nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used as a ground cover in landscaping."
