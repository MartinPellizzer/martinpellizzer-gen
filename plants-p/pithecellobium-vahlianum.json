    "intro": "Pithecellobium vahlianum, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, making it a visually appealing ornamental species. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sunlight. Pithecellobium vahlianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
