It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
