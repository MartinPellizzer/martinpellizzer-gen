    "intro": "Pterostylis spissa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or brownish flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
