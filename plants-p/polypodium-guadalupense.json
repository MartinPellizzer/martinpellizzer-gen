    "intro": "Polypodium guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupan huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with dark green, leathery fronds. Native to Mexico, particularly in the Guadalupan region, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce aerial roots. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
