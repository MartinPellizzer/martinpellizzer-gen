    "intro": "Photinia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
