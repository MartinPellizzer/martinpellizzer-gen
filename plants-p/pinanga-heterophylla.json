It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit and its ability to produce both leaves and inflorescences from the same stem.

Pinanga heterophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
