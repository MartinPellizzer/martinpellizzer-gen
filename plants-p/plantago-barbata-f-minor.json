    "intro": "Plantago barbata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, branched flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Plantago barbata."
