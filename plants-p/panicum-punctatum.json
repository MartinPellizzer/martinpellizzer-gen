    "intro": "Panicum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage with prominent purplish or reddish veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ornamental value comes from its striking coloration and drought tolerance."
