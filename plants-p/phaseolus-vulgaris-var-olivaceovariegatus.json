This variety is typically an annual vine that produces elongated, bean-like pods, often with a yellowish-green coloration. The leaves are usually lobed and exhibit a unique coloration due to the presence of chlorophyll variations. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This plant is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of edible beans."
