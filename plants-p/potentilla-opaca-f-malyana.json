    "intro": "Potentilla opaca f. malyana, commonly known as the Malyan potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
