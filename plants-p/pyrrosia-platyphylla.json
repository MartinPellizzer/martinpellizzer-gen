    "intro": "Pyrrosia platyphylla, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. Pyrrosia platyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
