    "intro": "Phegopteris adnata, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris adnata has a long evolutionary history and is considered a relict species with ancient lineage."
