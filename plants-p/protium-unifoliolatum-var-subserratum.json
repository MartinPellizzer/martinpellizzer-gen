    "intro": "Protium unifoliolatum var. subserratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sycamore, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are slightly serrated along the margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
