    "intro": "Piriqueta rosea, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Piriqueta rosea is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
