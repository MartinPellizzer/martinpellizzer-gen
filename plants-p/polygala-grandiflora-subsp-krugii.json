    "intro": "Polygala grandiflora subsp. krugii, commonly known as the Krug's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature common in the Polygala genus. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
