It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like foliage and is often cultivated as an ornamental in rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
