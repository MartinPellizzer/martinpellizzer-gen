    "intro": "Polypodium asterothrix, commonly known as the star-hair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a star-like pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots. The spores are borne in sori that are clustered in a unique, star-shaped arrangement, contributing to its common name."
