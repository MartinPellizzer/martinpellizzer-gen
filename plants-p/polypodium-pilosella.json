    "intro": "Polypodium pilosella, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. Polypodium pilosella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
