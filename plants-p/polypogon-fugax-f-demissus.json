    "intro": "Polypogon fugax f. demissus, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. The subspecies demissus is distinguished by its shorter stature and more loosely arranged foliage compared to the typical form."
