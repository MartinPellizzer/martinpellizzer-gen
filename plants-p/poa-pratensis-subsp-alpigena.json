    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. alpigena, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountain meadows and rocky soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
