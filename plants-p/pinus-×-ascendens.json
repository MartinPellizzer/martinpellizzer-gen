It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas, specifically in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. The tree typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine environments, where it forms dense stands. Its needles are long and slender, and it produces cones that are often retained on the branches for several years. The plant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
