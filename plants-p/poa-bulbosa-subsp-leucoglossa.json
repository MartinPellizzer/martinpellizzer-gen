    "intro": "Poa bulbosa subsp. leucoglossa, commonly known as the silver-lipped bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-blue foliage due to the presence of dense, fine hairs on the leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that is often adorned with white or pale glumes, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
