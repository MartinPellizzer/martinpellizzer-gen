    "intro": "Pontederia eriantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, lavender-colored flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Pontederiaceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in wetlands and ponds. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native species for resources."
