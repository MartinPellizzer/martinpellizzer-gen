    "intro": "Pitcairnia pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
