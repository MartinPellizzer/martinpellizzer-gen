    "intro": "Pinus khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi pine, is a coniferous tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that mature over several years, with the female cones releasing winged seeds when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for reforestation and landscaping purposes."
