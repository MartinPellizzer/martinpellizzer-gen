    "intro": "Primula microdonta f. micromeres, commonly known as the miniature primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This variant is prized in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cool, shaded environments."
