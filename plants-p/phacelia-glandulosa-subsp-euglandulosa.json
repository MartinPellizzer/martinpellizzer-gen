    "intro": "Phacelia glandulosa subsp. euglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in glandular structures that secrete oils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and open woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
