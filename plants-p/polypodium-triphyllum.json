    "intro": "Polypodium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The foliage is evergreen, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
