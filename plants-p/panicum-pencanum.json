    "intro": "Panicum pencanum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, fluffy panicles that are often pink to red in color. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for erosion control. The botanical features of Panicum pencanum include narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to form clumps rather than spreading aggressively."
