    "intro": "Puya gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant features large, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in a spectacular display at the top of the plant. Puya gaudichaudii is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, humid conditions."
