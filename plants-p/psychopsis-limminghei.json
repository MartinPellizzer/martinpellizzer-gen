    "intro": "Psychopsis limminghei, commonly known as the Limminghei psychopsis, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, evergreen leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. Its flowers, which are typically violet or purple, are borne on tall, erect inflorescences and are highly attractive to pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural environment."
