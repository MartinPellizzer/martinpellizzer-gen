    "intro": "Papaver corsicum, commonly known as the Corsican poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It features striking, bright red or orange petals that form a cup-like shape, with a prominent central stigma. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Papaver corsicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
