    "intro": "Paramapania longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked paramapania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paramapania longirostris is considered a species of conservation concern."
