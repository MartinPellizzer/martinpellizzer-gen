    "intro": "Polypodium lanceolatum var. trichophorum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the lanceolate polypody. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
