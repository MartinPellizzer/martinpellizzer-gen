    "intro": "Pyrus belladonna, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark red as they mature. It is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine, though its berries are toxic and should be handled with care."
