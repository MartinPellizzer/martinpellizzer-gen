    "intro": "Pedicularis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
