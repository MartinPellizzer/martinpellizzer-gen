    "intro": "Piper ulmifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf pepper or Indian pepper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries. The berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are not as widely used as black pepper. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
