    "intro": "Paronychia paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Paronychia paphlagonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
