    "intro": "Polystichum assurgentipinnum, commonly known as the ascending fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Japan. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive upward-curving shape. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
