It features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a dense spike of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species."
