    "intro": "Parodia microsperma var. cafayatensis, commonly known as the Cafayate Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of white, soft spines that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant has a ribbed stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
