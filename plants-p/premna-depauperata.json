It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
