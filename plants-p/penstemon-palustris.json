    "intro": "Penstemon palustris, commonly known as marsh beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supporting clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in damp environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
