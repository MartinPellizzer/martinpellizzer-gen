It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
