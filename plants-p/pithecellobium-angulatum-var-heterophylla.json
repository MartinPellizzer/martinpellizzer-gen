    "intro": "Pithecellobium angulatum var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf pithecellobium, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential nutritional benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
