    "intro": "Panicum sabulorum var. thinium, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to sandy and coastal environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or other sandy habitats. Its resilience to salt spray and drought makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
