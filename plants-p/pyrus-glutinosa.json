    "intro": "Pyrus glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by sticky, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit's unique sticky texture and sweet, aromatic flavor make it distinctive among pear species. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and interesting fruit characteristics."
