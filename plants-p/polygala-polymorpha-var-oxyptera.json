    "intro": "Polygala polymorpha var. oxyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and it produces a milky sap when damaged. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
