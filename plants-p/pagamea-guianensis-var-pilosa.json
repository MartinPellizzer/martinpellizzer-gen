It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
