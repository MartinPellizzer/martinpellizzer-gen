    "intro": "Plantaginella alpina, commonly known as alpine plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and poor nutrient conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Plantaginella alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
