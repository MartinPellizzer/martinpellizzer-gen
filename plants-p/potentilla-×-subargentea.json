    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subargentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
