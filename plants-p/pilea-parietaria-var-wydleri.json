    "intro": "Pilea parietaria var. wydleri, commonly known as the stone plant or wall lettuce, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to rocky habitats in southern Europe. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear on slender stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it a hardy and resilient choice for xeriscaping."
