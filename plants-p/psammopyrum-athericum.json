    "intro": "Psammopyrum athericum, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Psammopyrum athericum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
