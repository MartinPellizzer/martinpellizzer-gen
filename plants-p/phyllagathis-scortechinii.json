    "intro": "Phyllagathis scortechinii, commonly known as the Malayan ground ivy, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by small, round berries. Phyllagathis scortechinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover in shaded gardens."
