The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions."
