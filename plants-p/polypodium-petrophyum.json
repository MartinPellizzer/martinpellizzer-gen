    "intro": "Polypodium petrophyum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium petrophyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
