    "intro": "Puya werneriana, commonly known as the giant torch cactus, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and vibrant, showy inflorescences that resemble torches, often blooming in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Puya werneriana is a slow-growing plant that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest species in the Bromeliaceae family."
