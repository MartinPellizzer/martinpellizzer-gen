    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. rosea, commonly known as the rosehip dogwood, is a compact, thorny shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, pinkish-red flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for hedging or as a specimen plant. The rosea form is distinguished by its showy, rose-colored flowers compared to the typical white or pink blooms of the species."
