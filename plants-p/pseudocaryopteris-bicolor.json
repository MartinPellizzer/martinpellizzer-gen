    "intro": "Pseudocaryopteris bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that display a striking two-color pattern, typically green and brown. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Pseudocaryopteris bicolor make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to shaded gardens."
