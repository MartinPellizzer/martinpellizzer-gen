    "intro": "Pseudosassafras, commonly known as false sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and avocado. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are often glandular-dotted. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. The bark and leaves contain aromatic compounds, though they are not as potent as true sassafras."
