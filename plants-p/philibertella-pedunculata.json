It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its most striking feature is its violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
