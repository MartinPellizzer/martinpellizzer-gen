    "intro": "Primula finmarchica, commonly known as the Baltic primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow or white flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
