    "intro": "Poa panicoides, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically forms sod-forming clumps and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release wind-dispersed seeds. Poa panicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various landscapes."
