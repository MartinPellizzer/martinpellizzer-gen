    "intro": "Pinus taeda var. heterophylla, commonly known as the yellow pine with variable foliage, is a variant of the loblolly pine native to the southeastern United States. This plant exhibits distinct morphological differences, particularly in leaf size and shape, which vary depending on environmental conditions. Its foliage is typically longer and more slender compared to the standard variety, contributing to its unique appearance. The cones of this variant are similar to those of the parent species, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests, playing a role in local ecosystems."
