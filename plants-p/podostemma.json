    "intro": "Podostemma, commonly known as the water spleenwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Podostemonaceae. These aquatic or semi-aquatic plants are typically found in slow-moving streams and rivers, where they attach themselves to rocks using specialized root systems. Their leaves are usually narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for underwater environments. Podostemma species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that often appear above the water surface. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
