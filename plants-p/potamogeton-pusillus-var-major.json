    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. major, commonly known as the giant pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and small, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly."
