    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
