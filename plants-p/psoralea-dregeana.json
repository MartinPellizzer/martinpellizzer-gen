    "intro": "Psoralea dregeana, commonly known as the African yellow balm, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Psoralea dregeana is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African cultures for various health purposes."
