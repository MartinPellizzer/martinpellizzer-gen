    "intro": "Portulacaria afra, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
