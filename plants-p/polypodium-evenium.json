    "intro": "Polypodium evenium, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has fronds that are deeply lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium evenium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
