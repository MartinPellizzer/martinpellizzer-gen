    "intro": "Polypodium punctatum var. rugosulum, commonly known as the rugose shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and serrated fronds that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
