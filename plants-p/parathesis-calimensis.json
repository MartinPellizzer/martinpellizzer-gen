    "intro": "Parathesis calimensis, commonly known as the Calimense Parathesis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendant-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to thrive in high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
