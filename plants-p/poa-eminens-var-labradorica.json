    "intro": "Poa eminens var. labradorica, commonly known as Labrador grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Labrador grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, alpine environments."
