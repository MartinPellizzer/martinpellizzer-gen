    "intro": "Phlox bimaculata, commonly known as the smooth phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Phlox bimaculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
