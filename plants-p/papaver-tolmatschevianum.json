    "intro": "Papaver tolmatschevianum, commonly known as the Tolkatschevian poppy, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its botanical features include smooth, hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
