    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 diversilobum, commonly known as the variegated geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that often display striking variegation of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant floral displays."
