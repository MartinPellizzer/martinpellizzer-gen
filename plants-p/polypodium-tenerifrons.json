    "intro": "Polypodium tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Islands huperzia, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Polypodium tenerifrons is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
