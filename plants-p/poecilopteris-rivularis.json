    "intro": "Poecilopteris rivularis, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Poecilopteris rivularis plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
