It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous petal-like bracts that can range in color from white to pink, red, and even yellow. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern.
