    "intro": "Peucedanum longifolium subsp. vourinense, commonly known as the Vourin's angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Carpathians. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
