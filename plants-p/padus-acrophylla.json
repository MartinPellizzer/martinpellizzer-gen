    "intro": "Padus acrophylla, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that become prominent in winter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Padus acrophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and streambanks."
