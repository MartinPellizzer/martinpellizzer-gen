    "intro": "Poa porrantha, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, blue-green flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Poa porrantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
