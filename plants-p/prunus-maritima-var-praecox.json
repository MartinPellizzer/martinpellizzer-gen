    "intro": "Prunus maritima var. praecox, commonly known as the early beach plum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet-tart berries that ripen in the summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along the shores. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing food for wildlife."
