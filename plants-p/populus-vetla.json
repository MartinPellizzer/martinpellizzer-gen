    "intro": "Populus vetla, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Populus vetla typically grows in moist soils near rivers, lakes, and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth rate and ability to tolerate pollution make it a valuable plant for urban landscaping and ecological restoration."
