    "intro": "Potentilla foersteriana var. ima, commonly known as the Ima potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by gardeners interested in alpine flora."
