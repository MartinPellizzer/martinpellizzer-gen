    "intro": "Parodia pseudoprocera var. aurantiaciflora, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to yellow spines. The plant produces striking, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
