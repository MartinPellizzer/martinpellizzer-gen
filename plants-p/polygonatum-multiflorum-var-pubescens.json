    "intro": "Polygonatum multiflorum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses. Its hairy texture distinguishes it from other varieties of Solomon's seal."
