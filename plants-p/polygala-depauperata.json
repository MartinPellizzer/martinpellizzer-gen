It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, spathaceous flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
