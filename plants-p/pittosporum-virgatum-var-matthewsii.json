    "intro": "Pittosporum virgatum var. matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthewsii Pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping. The variety is more compact than the typical Pittosporum virgatum, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
