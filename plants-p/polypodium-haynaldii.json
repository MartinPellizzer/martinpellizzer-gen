    "intro": "Polypodium haynaldii, commonly known as the Haynald's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in areas with high air moisture."
