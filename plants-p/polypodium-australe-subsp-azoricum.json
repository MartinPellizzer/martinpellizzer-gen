    "intro": "Polypodium australe subsp. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean wall fern, is a fern native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to humid, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas."
