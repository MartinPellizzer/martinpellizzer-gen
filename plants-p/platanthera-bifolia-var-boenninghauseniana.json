    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. boenninghauseniana, commonly known as the Boenninghausen's lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and dense, dark green foliage, which support its showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing intricate, spiraled inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
