It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx that turns orange-red as the fruit matures. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Physalis hintonii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
