    "intro": "Phyllanthus lasiogynus, commonly known as the roughleaf phyllanthus, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain single seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
