    "intro": "Pithecellobium littorale, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments. Pithecellobium littorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
