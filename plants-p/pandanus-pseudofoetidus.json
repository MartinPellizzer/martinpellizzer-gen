    "intro": "Pandanus pseudofoetidus, commonly known as the swamp pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cooking. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy areas, thriving in humid environments with poor soil drainage. Its inflorescence consists of small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in a spadix, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and animals. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of coastal and wetland ecosystems."
