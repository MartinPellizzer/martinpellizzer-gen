    "intro": "Physalis ciliata, commonly known as the hairy groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyces that enclose the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe, though they are typically harvested before full maturity. Its leaves are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Physalis ciliata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
