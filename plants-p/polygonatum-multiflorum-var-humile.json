    "intro": "Polygonatum multiflorum var. humile, commonly known as the lesser Solomon's seal, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats and has a rhizomatous root system. Its botanical name reflects its association with the genus Polygonatum, which includes several species of Solomon's seals. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
