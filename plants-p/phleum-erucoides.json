    "intro": "Phleum erucoides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
