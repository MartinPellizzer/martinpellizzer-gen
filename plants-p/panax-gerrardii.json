    "intro": "Panax gerrardii, commonly known as the ginseng plant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fleshy roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in rich, moist forest soils and thrives in shaded environments. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
