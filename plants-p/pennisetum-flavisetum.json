    "intro": "Pennisetum flavisetum, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a silvery-blue sheen. Its striking pink to purple inflorescence, which appears in late summer, makes it a popular ornamental plant. Pennisetum flavisetum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
