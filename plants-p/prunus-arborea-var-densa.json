    "intro": "Prunus arborea var. densa, commonly known as the dense cherry, is a compact, shrub-like species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a thick, bushy appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a deep red or black color, often attracting wildlife. This plant is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
