    "intro": "Polystichum artemisioides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, leathery, and glossy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom that gives them a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens."
