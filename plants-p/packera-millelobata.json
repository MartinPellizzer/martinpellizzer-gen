    "intro": "Packera millelobata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often cool, humid habitat. Packera millelobata is also known for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
