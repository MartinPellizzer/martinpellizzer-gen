    "intro": "Populus mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in the spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Populus mandschurica is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
