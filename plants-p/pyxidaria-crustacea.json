It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant's botanical features include finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seed pods, which are thick and leathery, mature to a reddish-brown color and remain attached to the plant for an extended period. Pyxidaria crustacea is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in temperate regions."
