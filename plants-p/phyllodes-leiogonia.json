    "intro": "Phyllodes leiogonia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery phyllodes that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and 1\u20132 cm wide. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its phyllodes are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
