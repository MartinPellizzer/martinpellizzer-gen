    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii subsp. bradyi, commonly known as the Simpson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
