    "intro": "Psychotria galintanensis, commonly known as the Galintanense Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species within its native range."
