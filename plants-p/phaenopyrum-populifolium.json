It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Phaenopyrum populifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
