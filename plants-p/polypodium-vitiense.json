    "intro": "Polypodium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Brake, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing sterile fronds and the second year producing spore-bearing leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. Its spores are released from the undersides of the mature fronds, which are covered in tiny, specialized structures called sporangia. Polypodium vitiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
