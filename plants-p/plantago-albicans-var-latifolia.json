    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
