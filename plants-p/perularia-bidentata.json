It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with two distinct teeth at the base of each leaf blade. Perularia bidentata is often found in disturbed or wetland environments and is adapted to thrive in saturated soil conditions."
