    "intro": "Peschiera stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense rosettes near the base. Peschiera stenantha is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes and low temperatures."
