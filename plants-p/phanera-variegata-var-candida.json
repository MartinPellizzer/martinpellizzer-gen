It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
