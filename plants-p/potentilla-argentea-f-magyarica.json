    "intro": "Potentilla argentea f. magyarica, commonly known as the Hungarian silverweed, is a variant of the silverweed species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
