    "intro": "Primula flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Primula flagellaris is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
