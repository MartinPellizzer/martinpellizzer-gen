It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomatous root system is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
