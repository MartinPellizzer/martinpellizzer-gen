It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, dense panicles of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
