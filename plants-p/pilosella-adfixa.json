    "intro": "Pilosella adfixa, commonly known as the fixed pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. Pilosella adfixa is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures."
