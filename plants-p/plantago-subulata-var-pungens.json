It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically borne on terminal inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in arid areas."
