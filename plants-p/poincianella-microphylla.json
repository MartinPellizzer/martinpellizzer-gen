    "intro": "Poincianella microphylla, commonly known as the little-leaf poincianella, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are small and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
