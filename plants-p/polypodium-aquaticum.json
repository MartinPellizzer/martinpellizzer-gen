    "intro": "Polypodium aquaticum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Polypodium aquaticum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
