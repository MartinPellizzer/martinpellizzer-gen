    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus parvus, commonly known as the small night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing plant with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Pseudopilocereus parvus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
