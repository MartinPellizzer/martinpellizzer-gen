    "intro": "Panicum musciparum, commonly known as the mouse-ear or sticky mouse-ear, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and small, spikelike inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are often coated in a sticky substance, aiding in seed adherence to animals or objects. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Panicum musciparum is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
