    "intro": "Poa brownii, commonly known as Brown's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant has slender, often tufted stems and small, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa brownii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
