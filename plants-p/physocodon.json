    "intro": "Physocodon, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically thick and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Physocodon species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowers. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
