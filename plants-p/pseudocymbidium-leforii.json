    "intro": "Pseudocymbidium leforii, commonly known as the Lefor's pseudocymbidium, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
