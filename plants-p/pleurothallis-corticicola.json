It is characterized by its compact growth habit and often features small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, using its roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Pleurothallis corticicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
