    "intro": "Pyrus jucunda, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by edible, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn red or orange in the autumn. Pyrus jucunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
