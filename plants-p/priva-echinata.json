    "intro": "Priva echinata, commonly known as the spiny privet, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
