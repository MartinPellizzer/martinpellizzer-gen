    "intro": "Pellaea sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
