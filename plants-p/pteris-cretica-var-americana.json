    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. americana, commonly known as the American water fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The botanical characteristics of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects."
