    "intro": "Prasophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Prasophyllum rostratum is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. It is also known for its ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
