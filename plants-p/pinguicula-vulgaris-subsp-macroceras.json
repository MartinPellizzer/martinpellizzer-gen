    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. macroceras, commonly known as the large-horned butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems bearing yellowish-green flowers with prominent, elongated petals. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its specialized morphology reflects its adaptation to nutrient acquisition through insect prey."
