    "intro": "Polypogon adscensionis, commonly known as the Ascension grass, is a species of grass native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a low-growing, perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is part of the local flora that supports endemic wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
