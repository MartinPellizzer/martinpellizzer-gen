    "intro": "Pteris lepidopoda, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris lepidopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
