    "intro": "Phyllostegia parviflora var. honolulensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in its native range."
