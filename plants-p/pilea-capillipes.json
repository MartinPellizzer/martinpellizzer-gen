    "intro": "Pilea capillipes, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are often described as resembling small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aerial roots allow it to climb or trail, making it a versatile houseplant. Pilea capillipes thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it relatively easy to care for."
