    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. pinifolium, commonly known as the pineleaf field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. The variety pinifolium is distinguished by its needle-like leaves, resembling those of conifers, which give it its common name."
