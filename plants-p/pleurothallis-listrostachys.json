    "intro": "Pleurothallis listrostachys, commonly known as the silver-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, and it is known for its delicate, strap-like leaves. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to high-altitude conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in protected areas."
