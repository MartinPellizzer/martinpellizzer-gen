    "intro": "Paspalum distichum, commonly known as flatleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, two-ranked leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. It is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardy nature. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense turf-like stands."
