    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 prostrata subsp. ciscaspica, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or semi-prostrate growth habit, with numerous small, dark green leaves arranged in pairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates."
