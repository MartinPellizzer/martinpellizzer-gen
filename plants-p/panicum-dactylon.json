    "intro": "Panicum dactylon, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield."
