    "intro": "Panicum borzianum, commonly known as the Borzian panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
