It typically grows in mountainous and alpine regions, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Poa urgutina plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
