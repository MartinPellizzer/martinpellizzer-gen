It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Pouteria paucinervia plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
