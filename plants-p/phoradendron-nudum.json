    "intro": "Phoradendron nudum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually oval in shape. Phoradendron nudum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries."
