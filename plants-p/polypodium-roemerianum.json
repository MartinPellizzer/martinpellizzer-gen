    "intro": "Polypodium roemerianum, commonly known as the roemer's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
