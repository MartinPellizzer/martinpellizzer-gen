    "intro": "Phoradendron orbiculare, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in a wide range of host species, including oaks, pines, and other broadleaf trees. Due to its unique growth habits and ecological role, it is an important component of many forest ecosystems."
