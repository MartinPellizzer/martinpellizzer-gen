    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 pulchrum, commonly known as the zonal geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, purple, and white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with distinct zonation patterns, which give the plant its common name. Native to South Africa, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for gardens and containers. Pelargonium \u00d7 pulchrum thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
