    "intro": "Phaseolus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild kidney bean, is a perennial legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces pods containing small, round seeds that are typically brown or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its wild nature, it is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated relatives."
