    "intro": "Primula jesoana var. hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing pale yellow to cream-colored petals with a distinctive throat. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
