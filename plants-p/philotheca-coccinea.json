It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife.

Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent invasive spread."
