    "intro": "Paspalum biglume, commonly known as two-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with two awns, which are bristle-like structures at the ends of the florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Paspalum biglume is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
