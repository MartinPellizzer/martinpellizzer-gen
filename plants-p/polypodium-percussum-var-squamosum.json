    "intro": "Polypodium percussum var. squamosum, commonly known as the scaly wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant's fronds are usually leathery and have a rugged, scaly texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and summer months. This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens or used in horticultural displays."
