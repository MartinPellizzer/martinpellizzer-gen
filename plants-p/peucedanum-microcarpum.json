    "intro": "Peucedanum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruits are small, dry, and ribbed, with a distinctive structure that aids in seed dispersal. Peucedanum microcarpum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
