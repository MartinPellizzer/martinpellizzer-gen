    "intro": "Potamogeton hybridus var. multidenticulatus, commonly known as the multi-toothed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth or slightly serrated surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often found in slow-moving rivers and lakes."
