    "intro": "Polygonum himalayense, commonly known as Himalayan knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from greenish-white to reddish-purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest margins. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in traditional medicine."
