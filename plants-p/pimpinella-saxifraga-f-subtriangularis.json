    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. subtriangularis, commonly known as the subtriangular cowparsley, is a rare and distinctive variety of the cowparsley species. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with leaves that are subtriangular in shape, giving it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant species."
