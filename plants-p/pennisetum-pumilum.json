    "intro": "Pennisetum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf fountain grass, is a low-growing, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture that adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that emerge in late summer, providing a soft, cloud-like appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and elegant appearance make it suitable for rock gardens, containers, or as a border plant."
