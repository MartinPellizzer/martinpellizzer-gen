    "intro": "Psychotria chimboracensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian morning glory, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain the seeds. It is notable for its chemical composition, including alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been studied for their pharmacological properties. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
