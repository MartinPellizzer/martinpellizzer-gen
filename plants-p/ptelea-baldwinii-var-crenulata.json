    "intro": "Ptelea baldwinii var. crenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The varietal form crenulata is distinguished by its more sharply toothed leaf margins compared to the typical species."
