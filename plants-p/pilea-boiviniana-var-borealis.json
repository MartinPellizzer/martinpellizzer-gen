    "intro": "Pilea boiviniana var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic pilea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
