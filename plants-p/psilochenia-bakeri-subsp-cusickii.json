    "intro": "Psilochenia bakeri subsp. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's psilochenia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
