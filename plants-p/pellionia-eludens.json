It features heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Pellionia eludens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to form dense ground cover."
