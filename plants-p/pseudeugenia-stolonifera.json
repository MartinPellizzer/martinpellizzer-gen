    "intro": "Pseudeugenia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping myrtle, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover large areas, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to drought contribute to its widespread presence in its native habitats."
