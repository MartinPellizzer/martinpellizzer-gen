    "intro": "Platylepis tidorensis, commonly known as the Tidore flatleaf, is a rare tropical plant native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss and limited research, it remains a poorly understood species within its native ecosystem."
