It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. The leaves are orbicular, meaning they are round or nearly round in shape, and are covered in fine hairs. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
