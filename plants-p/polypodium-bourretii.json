    "intro": "Polypodium bourretii, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are densely covered with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium bourretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
