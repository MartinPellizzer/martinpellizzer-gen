It features upright stems with clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its short stature and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
