It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other parsley species, while its flowers are small and white or pale green. Peucedanum pyrenaicum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
