    "intro": "Psychotria silhouettae, commonly known as the Silhouetta psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
