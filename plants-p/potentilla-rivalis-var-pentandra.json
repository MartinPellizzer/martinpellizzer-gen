    "intro": "Potentilla rivalis var. pentandra, commonly known as the pink potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long flowering period."
