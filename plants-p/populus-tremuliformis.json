    "intro": "Populus tremuliformis, commonly known as the quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Salicaceae family and is known for its ability to form extensive clonal colonies through its root system. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in catkins and are followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Populus tremuliformis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
