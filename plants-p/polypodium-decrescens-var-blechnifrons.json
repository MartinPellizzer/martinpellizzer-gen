    "intro": "Polypodium decrescens var. blechnifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The varietal name *blechnifrons* refers to the resemblance of its fronds to those of the genus *Blechnum*."
