    "intro": "Pinus strobiformis var. carvajalii, commonly known as the Carvajal's white pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this species are relatively small and mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
