    "intro": "Pleroma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of rainforests. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in non-native settings."
