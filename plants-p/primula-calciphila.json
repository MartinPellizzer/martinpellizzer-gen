    "intro": "Primula calciphila, commonly known as the limestone primrose, is a flowering plant native to calcareous habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are typically basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Primula calciphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in specialized habitats."
