    "intro": "Pedicularis ingens, commonly known as the giant lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it one of the tallest species in the genus Pedicularis. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Pedicularis ingens thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
