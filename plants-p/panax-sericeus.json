    "intro": "Panax sericeus, commonly known as the silver ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are typically harvested for their medicinal properties. Its roots are used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments, including fatigue and stress. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax sericeus is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
