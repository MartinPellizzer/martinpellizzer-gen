    "intro": "Panicum depauperatum var. involutum, commonly known as the curled panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or rolled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
