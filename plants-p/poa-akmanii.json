    "intro": "Poa akmanii, commonly known as the Akmanii bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense clumps and has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spike that bears small, two-ranked spikelets. Poa akmanii is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
