    "intro": "Pinea cembra, commonly known as the Swiss pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and cone-like structures that hang from the branches. The tree thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its wood is dense and durable, historically used for construction and furniture. Pinea cembra plays a vital role in mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
