    "intro": "Piptatherum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Piptatherum mexicanum is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils."
