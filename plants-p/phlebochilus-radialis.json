    "intro": "Phlebochilus radialis, commonly known as the radial phlebotomine fly, is a species of sand fly belonging to the family Psychodidae. It is characterized by its small size, slender body, and distinctive wing patterns that include radial veins. This plant-like name may be a misnomer, as it is actually an insect rather than a botanical species. The fly is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in sandy or forested environments. While not a plant, it plays a role in ecological systems by serving as a host for certain parasites."
