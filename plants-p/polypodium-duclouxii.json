    "intro": "Polypodium duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
