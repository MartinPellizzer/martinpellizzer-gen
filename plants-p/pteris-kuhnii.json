    "intro": "Pteris kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky surfaces or soil. Pteris kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
