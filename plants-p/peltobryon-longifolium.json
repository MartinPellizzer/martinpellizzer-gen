    "intro": "Peltobryon longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltobryaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, thin leaves that are often arranged in a dense, carpet-like growth form. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. The plant's simple morphology and preference for humid conditions make it a common indicator species in certain ecological settings."
