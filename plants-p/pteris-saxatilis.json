    "intro": "Pteris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. This fern is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
