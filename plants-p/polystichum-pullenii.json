    "intro": "Polystichum pullenii, commonly known as the Pullen's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum pullenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
