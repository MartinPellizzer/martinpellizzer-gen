    "intro": "Polypodium lindenianum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or rocky substrates. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to vertical surfaces. Polypodium lindenianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
