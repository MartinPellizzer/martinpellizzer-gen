    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha subvar. biserrata, commonly known as the yellow cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its stems are generally covered in a similar hairy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes."
