    "intro": "Plantago himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh mountain conditions. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
