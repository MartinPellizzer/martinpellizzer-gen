    "intro": "Porpax reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that often display a mix of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its intricate network of veins in the leaves gives it its common name, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
