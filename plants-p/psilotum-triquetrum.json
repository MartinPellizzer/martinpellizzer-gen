    "intro": "Psilotum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant forms a dense, low-growing mat with a central stem and whorls of sporophylls at the nodes. Its sporangia are clustered in groups called synangia, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the sporophylls. Psilotum triquetrum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions."
