    "intro": "Poa caesia var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage that turns a silvery-gray in the winter. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and fine texture."
