    "intro": "Psiadia alticola, commonly known as the alpine psiadia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces bracts that help protect the flower heads. Psiadia alticola is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
