    "intro": "Phleum pratense subsp. vulgare, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. Timothy grass is also valued as a forage crop for livestock due to its nutritional content and palatability."
