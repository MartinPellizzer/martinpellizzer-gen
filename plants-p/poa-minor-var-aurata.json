    "intro": "Poa minor var. aurata, commonly known as the golden moss grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fine, soft leaves that often display a golden hue, especially under sunny conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and natural landscapes."
