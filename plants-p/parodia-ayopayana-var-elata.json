    "intro": "Parodia ayopayana var. elata, commonly known as the Tall Parodia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
