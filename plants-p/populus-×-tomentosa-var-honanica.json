    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 tomentosa var. honanica, commonly known as the Honan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
