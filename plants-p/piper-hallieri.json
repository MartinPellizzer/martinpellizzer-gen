    "intro": "Piper hallieri, commonly known as the Trinidad pepper or Hallier's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago, and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, round berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical regions."
