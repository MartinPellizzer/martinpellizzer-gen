    "intro": "Pilostigma inflexum, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in degraded landscapes."
