    "intro": "Pachylobus barteri, commonly known as the Barter's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
