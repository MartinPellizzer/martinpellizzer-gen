    "intro": "Polypogon inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. Polypogon inaequalis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
