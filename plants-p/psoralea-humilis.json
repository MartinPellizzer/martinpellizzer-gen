It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
