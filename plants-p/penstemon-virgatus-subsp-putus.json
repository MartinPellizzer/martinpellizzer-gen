    "intro": "Penstemon virgatus subsp. putus, commonly known as the plains penstemon, is a perennial herb native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
