    "intro": "Paronychia fastigiata var. paleacea, commonly known as the paleaceus evergreen holly, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and aromatic. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, evergreen foliage, and seasonal floral display."
