It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often twine around other vegetation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a glossy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, three-lobed berries that are typically reddish when mature."
