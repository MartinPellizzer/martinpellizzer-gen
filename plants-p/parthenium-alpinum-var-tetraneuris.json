    "intro": "Parthenium alpinum var. tetraneuris, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with finely divided, silver-white hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
